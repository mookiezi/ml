<GOOD> cleaned_content
<GOOD> Where do I actually add the MM and other weekly event roles?
<GOOD> Alrighty
<GOOD> Thanks
<GOOD> I don't appear to be able to see the bdsp role voting channel. Could I be directed to it please?
<GOOD> Spoilers off?
<GOOD> I'm an idiot disregard it
<GOOD> I didn't know only ppl with dex completion could see it
<GOOD> Where is the tiny or heavy leaderboard?
<GOOD> How often are the roles given?
<GOOD> Oh yeah does  have a counter anywhere btw
<GOOD> Man we aren't even close
<GOOD> Man
<GOOD> Time to grind
<GOOD> Where do I find mod apps again? Is it the pins of this channel
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> Within the Moderator application I have to input my date of joining the server but due to an accidental kick it's about a year less than it should be. Should I input my current join date or find the original?
<GOOD> The question still stands because I'm confused on it
<GOOD> I have no clue on where to find it
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Thanks
<GOOD> Is there a way to see who is removed or banned from the server by mods?
<GOOD> For the Natulie contest is there a way to confirm my eligibility for it?
<GOOD> Nvm I submitted it anyway
<GOOD> How do I access the community outreach role? Apparently the people who got it don't even know
<GOOD> I assume the funny pikachu role will go away after April Fools is over?
<GOOD> Ok thanks
<GOOD> How do I choose which role colour is displayed?
<GOOD> It appears the war role is still not a cr role and I think that means it overwrites the cr ones
<GOOD> Nvm it must have been fixed earlier, ignore me
<GOOD> The CC5 (PoP) role isn't showing up when I use !cr with Silvally, so I can't add or remove it
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> License color change, it's in trainer announcements
<GOOD> Fine
<GOOD> Where is the ToH leaderboard?
<GOOD> Is Bluips responsible for ALL the weekly events then?
<GOOD> Is aggressively spamming the same command constantly in  ok?
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> Ohhhh sorry, thought it was a poGaming ping
<GOOD> A genuine question but how are non-LTs posting images in here?
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Is blocking a moderator ok or is that not allowed due to warnings provided by them? Unless Silvally  officialy warns me via DM
<GOOD> Do you think ScaVio chat or leaks chat may be opened depending on the amount of content revealed in the trailer?
<GOOD> How do I rearrange my role colours?
<GOOD> Keep non-questions out of here please
<GOOD> Heya, do you have a question?
<GOOD> We don't work on a bot level system, best to ask elsewhere bc this channel is for questions about THIS server
<GOOD> Hey, do you have a question?
<GOOD> this channel is for server related questions, please don't send random stuff here
<GOOD> Either  or  are the channels you want
<GOOD> Hi, and welcome! Happy to have you. Unfortunately videos made by yourself do require self-promo permissions and channel access, but once you get licensed trainer you are free to promote it there!

<GOOD> Hello! Do you have a question?
<GOOD> Ah, ok. This channel is for questions about the server, but  is a good starting place to talk to people
<GOOD> Welcome to the server!
<GOOD> We have
<GOOD> But you require Licensed Trainer to send images
<GOOD> Take a read of  if you wanna get it
<GOOD> heya, this channel is for server questions. If you wanna talk about GO you can talk in  , and to send images there I'd take a read of
<GOOD> hiya, this channel is for questions about the server so please keep it clear

<GOOD> That's your ID
<GOOD> to get image perms
<GOOD> This is a public server, invites are able to be sent by anyone
<GOOD> Heya! You can send all suggestions to  so we can look at and consider them

<GOOD> LF: Looking For (what you want)
FT: For Trade (what you have)
<GOOD> Nope, you're good
<GOOD> Looking For and For Trade
<GOOD> < this should be it
<GOOD> Sorry that happened to you, but we do not moderate trade scams here
<GOOD> You need to remove the symbols surrounding the commands
<GOOD> Ah mb
<GOOD> DM  !role remove spoilers, or send it in
<GOOD> Either ping in an appropriate games channel or reach out via DM
<GOOD> Yes, but we do not moderate trades in the case of scams, so be wary
<GOOD> Trade scam?
<GOOD> We do not moderate trade scams, it's trading at your own risk due to the manpower required to moderate it
<GOOD> That would set the precedent that we moderate all trade scams, which would create a large amount of duress on our team. Instead we heavily encourage and teach users about how to avoid being scammed so it doesn't happen to them.
<GOOD> Like we said, we don't have the manpower to moderate such a thing, plus most trades happen outside of this server
<GOOD> Looking for, for trade
<GOOD> Reverse those
<GOOD> to get embed perms
<GOOD> We make an announcement when we take new mods onto our team
<GOOD> We had a 5 minute cooldown we lowered

<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> heya, this chat is for questions about the server. You want  . To send images take a look at

<GOOD> Try it in  and click on the pop up command
<GOOD> When you type / it should bring up some prompts
<GOOD> Since you don't have Licensed Trainer, this server is fine
<GOOD> to report, open a ticket by typing /ticket in any channel and selecting the command for our bot
<GOOD> Here or a ticket
<GOOD> Though try to compile it all into 1 message here, as messages here alert available moderators
<GOOD> We'll look into it, ty for the suggestion!
<GOOD> Either is fine
<GOOD> please move this to
<GOOD> This channel is for questions about the server
<GOOD> Yes, you are perfectly fine to post again after the cooldown is up
<GOOD> this channel is for questions about the server. I'd recommend
<GOOD> I can post the images there on your behalf
<GOOD> Heya, we have already redirected the user and their question had been dealt with
<GOOD> So please keep the channel clear for server questions, as messages here alert moderators
<GOOD> Your first role is probably gonna be licensed trainer, take a look at
<GOOD> What do you mean by that
<GOOD> We do not moderate trades, we have guides pinned in trading channels to help avoid scams due to the strain it would put on our team to moderate them
<GOOD> It's unfortunate but we cannot
<GOOD> It's just a fair warning to you, but our guide is quite helpful
<GOOD> Hope you enjoy our server!
<GOOD> You get a role colour
<GOOD> Hiya, do you have a question?
<GOOD> Discord search, from: (your user), after (day the last wave happened)

<GOOD> You have to reapply next wave if you didn't meet the quota the first time
<GOOD> Mind opening a ticket to explain this in more detail so we can clarify it better?
<GOOD> Well the next wave starts in ~2 days, so probably then
<GOOD> Looking For, For Trade
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Nope, all
<GOOD> A role colour and that's it
<GOOD> Open a ticket by typing /ticket in any channel
<GOOD> hey there, this channel is for questions about the server only
<GOOD> hi there, this is for questions about the server. I can post this in  if you want
<GOOD> Open a ticket with /ticket in any channel
<GOOD> 961057200711794719 is yours

<GOOD> Yes, if you wish to report one please open a ticket
<GOOD> Your best bet for a first role is licensed trainer, which grants image perms and stuff. Try
<GOOD> We have some achievement roles too, pinned in their respective franchise channels
<GOOD> keep idle stuff out of here, go to  if you want to embed elsewhere
<GOOD> Full national for Cynthia's protege
<GOOD> Also, every message in this channel alerts mods, please move to a channel like  or
<GOOD> Just sinnoh dex
<GOOD> You need licensed trainer first, check

<GOOD> You typed it like ''!fuse''
<GOOD> Or with some surrounding punctuation
<GOOD> Np
<GOOD> don't self promote here
<GOOD> If you want, sure!
<GOOD> Whenever a mod can go over your application
<GOOD> Try
<GOOD> You make a post of what you want and what you have to trade and post it, the messages are on 1 hour cooldown
<GOOD> Is the dex bot down rn or just disabled in poGaming
<GOOD> Slowmode is present to prevent spam and allow posts to be seen in that channel. It's on a 1 hr cooldown
<GOOD> Try
<GOOD> Read the pins in said channel (licensed trainer is also a thing to read up on at )
<GOOD> It is for help with THIS server
<GOOD> Read pins in the self promo channel
<GOOD> Also I'd recommend  as you need that beforehand
<GOOD> Pride month
<GOOD> Sorry for the delay, you've probably seen it's done now
<GOOD> If this is Go, then I'd recommend
<GOOD> This is a channel for questions about the server in general
<GOOD> I'd recommend  for that
<GOOD> Gaming News is not a channel, the role just means we ping you in  when gaming news happens
<GOOD> is best
<GOOD> I forget this part happens
<GOOD> Moon is pretty strong idk
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> However
<GOOD> Idk why I did this
<GOOD> He's gross
<GOOD> He looks so bad in game

<GOOD> Peak content
<GOOD> I got a new cheap keyboard and mouse to use
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Wait what's confusing about it
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> It was some random amazon keyboard for 10 quid
<GOOD> Actually the box is all in chinese iirc
<GOOD> I can just move the keys around fr
<GOOD> Is there a way to change the keyboard layout
<GOOD> Ok good
<GOOD> America uninstalled
<GOOD> You now know what the fuck a kilometer is
<GOOD> I mean I only have 250GB of storage lmao

<GOOD> Still not getting it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Oh wait I know this
<GOOD> I love sonic hedgehog
<GOOD> Yeah, all these people thinking they shouldn't start a land war in Asia
<GOOD> Well it's one of the classic blunders
<GOOD> The most famous is to never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less known is this: never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line
<GOOD> The suspenders are cute af
<GOOD> Hrllo
<GOOD> Helpo9
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> I'm tipsy x_x
<GOOD> Inded

<GOOD> Decent
<GOOD> It's a pik 2 enemy
<GOOD> I woke up to more cool animation today so I'm happy
<GOOD> It's by far the smoothest part of the ep
<GOOD> The rest was just good
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> Pizza tower gamering
<GOOD> Pizza Tower is so fun
<GOOD> I just beat The Noise and have had to stop because it would have damaged my wrists but like
<GOOD> It's fun
<GOOD> I love this fucker
<GOOD> She does like a catwalk strut for her ult
<GOOD> My mom reheated breakfast in the microwave and it's fucked up my stomach
<GOOD> Lovely
<GOOD> No but I only ate a bit so issall good
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> Maybe in the oven
<GOOD> But microwaved stuff is disgusting
<GOOD> Usually because the microwave tastes awful
<GOOD> It makes everything rubbery
<GOOD> Because it's your opinion
<GOOD> Microwaved food is like a massive whatever
<GOOD> If it's reheated there when it isn't supposed to though it tastes like I'm eating a warm shoe
<GOOD> MONEY WON THE SPLATFEST
<GOOD> SECURE THAT BAG
<GOOD> ik this game is old af but this new DLC makes me wanna buy it
<GOOD> Average local bus
<GOOD> He's just a cowardly ass lmao
<GOOD> Oooo the baby blue hoodie goes nice with the dress
<GOOD> Skirt? Idk sorry
<GOOD> Yeah sorry
<GOOD> Am bad at fashion
<GOOD> I thought that was edited tbh
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Finally have a flag pfp, my irl friends have not questioned it
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> I need to make my steam wishlist longer
<GOOD> Enby
<GOOD> It's pastel to make falinks stand out more
<GOOD> I wanna be a bit lowkey
<GOOD> Ughhh setting up emus is hard
<GOOD> Bathe then
<GOOD> Takes less energy
<GOOD> Ew
<GOOD> Oh also Sophie
<GOOD> I got into the University
<GOOD> Am officially moving to Wales
<GOOD> Tyty, I just about scraped by
<GOOD> Just a shame I don't know Welsh
<GOOD> I cannot speak cymraeg
<GOOD> Is the kkkkkkkk part dragged on
<GOOD> Gotcha
<GOOD> I don't understand how Welsh works at all since they don't follow the every word needs a vowel rule
<GOOD> Yeah the uni has like, 2 different flyers for everything
<GOOD> Since no one knows Welsh
<GOOD> Wait really?
<GOOD> Ohhh
<GOOD> I would butcher the pronunciation of every word
<GOOD> I slept for 12 hours today
<GOOD> After sleeping like 5 yesterday
<GOOD> Yeah I don't have that opportunity
<GOOD> I don't usually sleep well enough
<GOOD> Anyway, I'm trying to make a list of stuff I'll need for uni
<GOOD> That's me in either bath or bed
<GOOD> Usually bath
<GOOD> Because I can space out freely
<GOOD> Wouldn't a long shower waste more
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Recently I almost fell asleep in the bath and drowned lmao
<GOOD> Lesson learned about relaxing too much
<GOOD> Fellas I think I might be a dragonball fan :((
<GOOD> This is upsetting news
<GOOD> (Not Super tho)
<GOOD> Super is just really bad
<GOOD> It has the worst shonen arc I've ever read
<GOOD> I still can't figure out what to buy for university
<GOOD> That's a good question
<GOOD> It's what I'm trying to figure out lmao
<GOOD> Sorta, I have a bluetooth keyboard and tablet
<GOOD> Also I meant supplies, not something massively pricey
<GOOD> (Also also, I prefer taking notes by hand)
<GOOD> Yeah I'm planning on living off stir fry
<GOOD> And egg fried rice
<GOOD> I mean stir fry is super cheap
<GOOD> And easy
<GOOD> Plus good for you
<GOOD> Actually reminds me I should probably buy knives when I'm there
<GOOD> You say that but I'm terrible at cutting stuff
<GOOD> A whole melon is not edible
<GOOD> You do have to cut it
<GOOD> I eat watermelons with my hands
<GOOD> Or just all melons
<GOOD> I also eat canteloupe with my hands
<GOOD> Scoop it
<GOOD> I will miss brioche when I go to uni
<GOOD> Will basically cut away every unnecessarily expensive part of my diet
<GOOD> Yeah but it's not as cheap as plain bread
<GOOD> I eat seeded bread but all types are fine
<GOOD> I don't get the overreaction to basic white bread
<GOOD> That's because it's the cheapest and most basic bread
<GOOD> I don't have like, a preference, it's what's cheapest
<GOOD> Cheap food isn't poverty
<GOOD> It's just not wasting money
<GOOD> I mean i literally had white toast this morning
<GOOD> They give prisoners water too
<GOOD> Doesn't mean drinking it makes me poor
<GOOD> So is most bread
<GOOD> Like there are breads that are better for you
<GOOD> But it's not like the majority is fantastic for you
<GOOD> I already have the meal plan sorted anyway
<GOOD> Toast for breakfast, cold rice and chicken for dinner, stir fry for tea
<GOOD> I literally live in England
<GOOD> I just don't like beans
<GOOD> Also the hurr durr it's like there's a war going on!?!?!?!? Doesn't apply because basic food can be good
<GOOD> They aren't struggle meals
<GOOD> I don't dislike those meals
<GOOD> A stir fry is just a basic dish what
<GOOD> Like I'm not just throwing whatever together, I'm planning on just having proper meals
<GOOD> Yeah but it's not even bad
<GOOD> Bread
<GOOD> White bread
<GOOD> You said it didn't have taste
<GOOD> Then just add a taste you like ig
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> I'm not picky, it's food
<GOOD> As long as I'm getting nutrition
<GOOD> Idek what the cheapest meat is
<GOOD> Local is usually cheap but like idk
<GOOD> Eh local butchers are ok
<GOOD> I'll probably live off chicken or smth
<GOOD> Oooo I can make chicken fried rice too
<GOOD> For smth easy
<GOOD> And steamed veg
<GOOD> I am getting a bunch of sonic games rn
<GOOD> Any particular recommendations?
<GOOD> (Apart from the obvious)
<GOOD> Is the Dreamcast or GC Sonic Adventure better
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Isn't that a Parm
<GOOD> It's just meat and cheese isn't it
<GOOD> I saw this fucking dog irl on a poster today
<GOOD> Also I may buy a 7 wired N64 and GC controller for emulators
<GOOD> Because it's not possible to use my 8bitdo on these games obviously
<GOOD> 6 face buttons
<GOOD> Wdym just the right stick
<GOOD> The right Dpad?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh also, do you need a proper wiimote for super paper mario
<GOOD> Or does a pro controller do
<GOOD> Oh nvm then
<GOOD> I wonder if I can get a wiimote adapter for the PC and stuff
<GOOD> That's later down the line tho
<GOOD> I am gonna try the first few Paper Marios
<GOOD> After playing Sticker Star I may as well
<GOOD> I enjoyed Sticker Star
<GOOD> Childhood game of mine
<GOOD> I have a ton of other GC games readied up
<GOOD> Viewtiful Joe 1 and 2, Animal Crossing, Double Dash, etcetc
<GOOD> It's my biggest emu library as a startsr
<GOOD> Starter
<GOOD> Any recommendations for Wii (without wiimote being necessary), GC, PS1 and 2, N64 and such are all appreciated
<GOOD> No handhelds for now tho
<GOOD> Original Xbox too
<GOOD> So like
<GOOD> The university I'm going to has an arts centre place where there's theatre
<GOOD> And they advertised a circus?
<GOOD> If they have a circus I'm absolutely going
<GOOD> Yeah you can be a clown {cursedcat}
<GOOD> (/j)
<GOOD> I'm kidding
<GOOD> I always wanted to go to the circus tbh
<GOOD> I would absolutely work as a clown
<GOOD> Takes a lot of work tho
<GOOD> They're performance artists
<GOOD> Yeah but like clowns have to train
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> I may pick up a GC controller this week
<GOOD> Or a port adapter idk
<GOOD> They're both pretty cheap
<GOOD> I installed Shadow the Hedgehog to play later
<GOOD> Isn't Toph in both entries of Avatar tho
<GOOD> Oh wait you mean physically disconnected
<GOOD> Hai Hedgey and Lumi
<GOOD> Decent, just starting all this planning for uni
<GOOD> It's intimidating
<GOOD> Hru
<GOOD> Oooo cool
<GOOD> Has anyone played the original Paper Mario here
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Does it have a timing system for attacks like Mario and Luigi or am I making an ass out of myself thinking I'm timing it wrong
<GOOD> Wait fr?
<GOOD> It must be tight as hell then since I'm not connecting shit
<GOOD> Or maybe I suck
<GOOD> Yeah but I'm ass at it lol
<GOOD> It's very charming so far, tho I only just got Goombario lmao
<GOOD> Only other one I've played is sticker star
<GOOD> I enjoyed it as a kid
<GOOD> I shall
<GOOD> I have TTYD and Super Paper Mario installed too
<GOOD> I have played a tiny bit of it as a kid
<GOOD> But the disc was ruined and would crash at the beginning of some mansion area
<GOOD> Has been in development many years
<GOOD> The prologue is still ongoing after goombario right
<GOOD> Colour Splash (hopefully it runs on my PC) and origami king
<GOOD> But I'm just playing 64 for now
<GOOD> Already did it
<GOOD> I grew up on 3DS
<GOOD> So I beat Dream Team and Paper Jam a while ago
<GOOD> Then I just suck
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Nah I basically did the hammer tutorial then had to do some ironing
<GOOD> Yeah ik
<GOOD> Ye I am
<GOOD> I got an emulator on my PC set up so any retro home console game recommendations are appreciated
<GOOD> I thought u regretted getting it smh
<GOOD> Tf is happening
<GOOD> Idk, I landed a jump in Paper Mario and this happened
<GOOD> Apparently
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Omfg
<GOOD> The game keeps crashing
<GOOD> Aaaa emulators are annoying
<GOOD> I think I have a shirt like that
<GOOD> Well the pattern
<GOOD> Hai Lumi and Hedgey
<GOOD> That's quitter talk
<GOOD> Everything is edible if you try hard enough
<GOOD> Getting chinese in a bit, yum
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> That's a tough one tbh, either char siu pork or salt and pepper chicken w fried rice
<GOOD> No idea but it's just yummy red pork basically
<GOOD> Yeah usually I have pork char siu and fried rice
<GOOD> Always lovely
<GOOD> Sometimes I get chips but like, they absolutely heap on the rice
<GOOD> Oh spring rolls too
<GOOD> Not much of a sauce person
<GOOD> Chicken balls nice tho
<GOOD> I got it
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> I just finished it
<GOOD> Had to burp so my tummy didn't hurt but it was super nice
<GOOD> I've drank 4 bottles of water this afternoon and am still thirsty
<GOOD> I'm so fucking glad I can drink as much water as I want
<GOOD> Nyaaaaa
<GOOD> They're like average size water bottles
<GOOD> I always have like 7 cooling in the fridge because I devour them
<GOOD> Risk I'm willing to take
<GOOD> Like how much water will I have to drink lmao
<GOOD> You have to drink enough to start diluting your own blood lmao
<GOOD> Like holy shit that's a lot
<GOOD> I'm aware of how reabsorption works in the body
<GOOD> That is a newton's cradle
<GOOD> And it does lose momentum
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> They killed off a gacha game I play
<GOOD> Because if I don't pull this mf it's about to become unplayable
<GOOD> He is far and away the best character
<GOOD> This makes no sense to anyone here but he's broken the game
<GOOD> That is lowballing
<GOOD> I'm f2p
<GOOD> Mario Ambassador is a hard af title at least
<GOOD> Hhhh should I
<GOOD> Yuh
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Np
<GOOD> Only 1 person irl knows because no one else recognises the flag in my pfp or cares enough
<GOOD> I'm proud of this
<GOOD> Hello chat
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> Just woke up
<GOOD> I had 7
<GOOD> I need an adapter soon so I can play my GC games

<GOOD> Can't buy
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Roundabouts are sick frfr (I hate driving on the large ones)
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> Swan familyyyy
<GOOD> He's so sick
<GOOD> 4* is the highest star rating for a base unit
<GOOD> They gain stars by being levelled up
<GOOD> 6 star units have to be maxed out so it kinda makes sense
<GOOD> Popping off
<GOOD> If they pull him
<GOOD> Also yes it's been Goofy fest so far
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Ultra instinct theme
<GOOD> Hi chat am lonely
<GOOD> I do wanna talk
<GOOD> I just don't know what to talk ab
<GOOD> Mostly shopping and prepping for university
<GOOD> Bit of both
<GOOD> I'm very happy to be going, but idk if I'm ready to be alone
<GOOD> Mmm, ye
<GOOD> It's scary, I can barely cook
<GOOD> And after I get on my feet I'll have to look for a job, accommodation for the next year, etcetc
<GOOD> I can make stir fry, prepare meats and heat up supermarket foods
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> It's basic food preparation
<GOOD> I don't even trust myself around knives
<GOOD> I guess
<GOOD> I'm just afraid of ruining the food
<GOOD> I meant moreso with stuff like too much soy sauce when stir frying
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> I really hope my dormmates are reasonable or possibly even a friend
<GOOD> Oh?
<GOOD> Too expensive
<GOOD> Would rather buy a giant bag of rice and prep it for the next few days at the start of a week
<GOOD> Economic and allows you to make fried rice the rest of the week, or just cold rice in the middle of the day
<GOOD> I'm basically gonna be making the same food all the time to make it easy
<GOOD> Mm, I didn't sign up for a quiet or alcohol free dorm since I thought it would cost more, but it seems like if people get too rowdy you can just contact the campus and be like yeah they just are being unreasonably loud and get reprimanded
<GOOD> Oop
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Idk if they are
<GOOD> I just made that assumption
<GOOD> Worst comes to worst, I'll buy noise cancelling headphones
<GOOD> Well just another thing to worry about
<GOOD> Nothing I can do about it
<GOOD> I got a room on the top floor facing a lovely view at least
<GOOD> Iirc it's a corner room
<GOOD> I signed up for the room so many months ago
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> This is also the recommended building for marine biologists so hope I have at least one on my floor
<GOOD> Me first
<GOOD> You're chaotic neutral
<GOOD> So like, I was super hyped about pulling a unit
<GOOD> And I pulled a second one
<GOOD> Gonnna start using this when I enter chats
<GOOD> There isn't any
<GOOD> Orange piccolo mid
<GOOD> I like his power awakened form tho
<GOOD> Monke
<GOOD> I'm in a gacha discord rn discussing which freddy would win in a battle royale
<GOOD> My money is on Molten
<GOOD> Because I play the gacha game
<GOOD> something something quadratic equations is telling
<GOOD> Not exactly the point
<GOOD> It's moreso application of your brain
<GOOD> What would you rather be taught, if you weren't listening to math you wouldn't be listening to a practical skill like taxes and economics
<GOOD> But you wouldn't listen
<GOOD> If you don't already, you wouldn't listen to something even less interesting
<GOOD> Cute pfp
<GOOD> You doing alr today Lumi?
<GOOD> Same but that just happens when I'm lying in bed and sad x_x
<GOOD> Me when the biological chemistry
<GOOD> I have a foundation year of Biology before my Marine Bio course
<GOOD> I really hope that the chem section isn't too awful
<GOOD> I'm just happy to go there
<GOOD> Oh boy
<GOOD> I hope they aren't also obscenely hard
<GOOD> What stuff
<GOOD> The timing?
<GOOD> My emulator kept crashing on paper mario 64 specifically
<GOOD> So I need a new one
<GOOD> Emulator
<GOOD> Project 64 on Windows 11 specifically has issues with Paper Mario 64
<GOOD> Mmmm lake of rot
<GOOD> FNAF lore frfr
<GOOD> (Apparently they confirmed smth about FNAF 4)
<GOOD> FNAF is awesome smh
<GOOD> I want guilty gear tbh
<GOOD> But I suck at fighting games
<GOOD> Yeah but like I can't do 4 minute staircase combos
<GOOD> So like
<GOOD> Is Guilty Gear Strive THE fighting game
<GOOD> I wanna try and get into a fighting game
<GOOD> And idk the best to try that with on Steam
<GOOD> Idk if I can run it tbh
<GOOD> Plus Guilty Gear's aesthetic looks more fjn
<GOOD> Fun
<GOOD> I mean I'd say THE fighting game of all time is SF2
<GOOD> But I meant more like, current hype
<GOOD> Nah I mean like as far as iconic goes
<GOOD> SF2 is like the game
<GOOD> I might buy Strive then
<GOOD> Eventually
<GOOD> Wha
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't play much smash, I almost got into Elite Smash in SSBU with Dedede and that's about it
<GOOD> I didn't really want to play Smash
<GOOD> It just feels very wonky at times
<GOOD> I want him
<GOOD> I haven't played a traditional 2D fighter before properly
<GOOD> Closest I got was casual Jojo ASBR
<GOOD> My biggest complication is being fucking intolerable after any extended amount of time
<GOOD> They've been gone a while
<GOOD> Strive is on my wishlist
<GOOD> Copping this later cuz apparently it's good
<GOOD> And DST crossover is great
<GOOD> Bro what the fuck
<GOOD> That's one of the biggest hitboxes I've ever seen if it's honest
<GOOD> Occasionally
<GOOD> The hitbox of the slash
<GOOD> It's huge
<GOOD> I don't live in the US
<GOOD> I'm waiting for a sale
<GOOD> But ye
<GOOD> She's definitely the first character I'm trying
<GOOD> And no That's a match I was watching
<GOOD> They all seem to be lol, also Bridget looks fun too
<GOOD> I love how squishy the dolphin is
<GOOD> I hope it goes on sale soon
<GOOD> It's gonna be my first serious fighting game
<GOOD> UK
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> I'll buy Cult of the Lamb for now
<GOOD> Fun fact I've never played a fighting game with rollback
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Yeah but she also has cool dolphin
<GOOD> Guilty gear strive
<GOOD> Will be on sale soon hopefully
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> Finally on my last few things packed for uni
<GOOD> Not long now
<GOOD> Huh
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I've never taken anything like that
<GOOD> Monks are crazy
<GOOD> Even in regular D&D
<GOOD> I like the open fist monk because at higher levels they can just put a ripple in your body that kills them if you choose
<GOOD> Fighting games hard
<GOOD> Outer space is sending me
<GOOD> Cult of the lamb is fun af
<GOOD> And FighterZ is hard for me
<GOOD> I'm bad at this game
<GOOD> Uh you have to go back to neutral on like hit 2 of the aerial string and activate the support
<GOOD> Otherwise you switch instead
<GOOD> Platform fighters can still be much more technical
<GOOD> Just look at Melee
<GOOD> Yes, a Smash Bros game
<GOOD> Try
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Hai Sophie hru
<GOOD> Apart from hungry, same
<GOOD> I decided imma emulate the older Armoured Core/MonHun games
<GOOD> I can't afford or run AC6
<GOOD> And can't afford Gen U/Rise
<GOOD> So may as well
<GOOD> Nope, I bought cult of the lamb for 10 yesterday and that'll be my stuff for the rest of the month
<GOOD> Am getting used to budgeting luxury stuff more and more
<GOOD> I can just download that on my 3DS
<GOOD> Which I prob will
<GOOD> I'll start with Monster Hunter PS2
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> It's the only one I've played
<GOOD> No Iceborne
<GOOD> I got bored once I got to arch tempered stuff
<GOOD> It just isn't fun
<GOOD> Arch tempered Kushala Daora was my breaking point
<GOOD> Arch tempered is just
<GOOD> Bad
<GOOD> It's like starved for creative ideas, let's give every endgame monster 1 billion health and damage
<GOOD> Yeah it causes so much weapon bouncing
<GOOD> I am learning FighterZ now
<GOOD> I will probably play Ginyu
<GOOD> His ass CANNOT count
<GOOD> Ew
<GOOD> Demon lookin ass
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Or just eat the fucking cake lmao
<GOOD> It's really simple
<GOOD> 1 slice, and half of it after bitching
<GOOD> Waaaaahhhhhh a vanilla cake partly, I don't enjoy vanilla quite as much as chocolate time to be a selfish ass
<GOOD> She didn't ask
<GOOD> She offered to make him a cake
<GOOD> Can I bake you a cake is different to what cake would you like
<GOOD> If I asked someone if they wanted some meat cooked to eat and they asked for prime angus, I'd probably tell em to fuck off
<GOOD> High quality steak
<GOOD> Plus he said preferred
<GOOD> Not I'm gonna throw a hissy fit if you don't make this
<GOOD> Bro he acted like a child
<GOOD> Yeah lmao
<GOOD> I was thinking of a child taking 1 nibble of food then saying they don't like it lmao
<GOOD> Also he absolutely made a scene
<GOOD> And pouted
<GOOD> Ttue
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> He didn't tho
<GOOD> Like if you're gonna complain that much about someone making you a cake you like, make your own
<GOOD> Like he literally said he liked vanilla
<GOOD> Birthday cake
<GOOD> Partner offered to make him a cake, he told her what cake he wanted unprompted, then complained when it wasn't what he asked for
<GOOD> Because I didn't offer to make you what you want
<GOOD> I offered to make you something
<GOOD> Do you like cheese
<GOOD> For free, as a gift
<GOOD> And then embarrassing your partner in front of their kids
<GOOD> He likes it
<GOOD> He just didn't want it on this cake ig?
<GOOD> It being offered to you doesn't mean you deserve to ask for what you want lmao
<GOOD> Like I prefer a cake without that super sugary icing on top, I don't mind icing but it's whatever. If someone makes me a cake, FOR FREE, that is what I like but with icing, who cares
<GOOD> He wasn't prompted to ask for a type of cake tho?
<GOOD> He was just offered a cake
<GOOD> Like hey do you want me to bake a cake
Yeah black forest gateau please
<GOOD> Which nobody asked for
<GOOD> Me when I have to eat.... good agreeable food for my partner instead of slightly more agreeable food
<GOOD> But then why make a big deal out of it
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> That's Quora level bait
<GOOD> He nibbled around the cake like a 5 year old lmao
<GOOD> Since even if it is bait unironically agreeing with it is concerning
<GOOD> Except it is food he likes
<GOOD> Sounds like my dad kicking off on my mom for not cooking him food he wants even tho it's food he likes
<GOOD> Like if you enjoy it, eat what you're given
<GOOD> Hey can I get you a coffee?
Yeah iced chocolate fudge frappe please
<GOOD> I hope this emulator works soon
<GOOD> There is a condition that mixes up your senses
<GOOD> Oooo that's cool(?)
<GOOD> Sorry
<GOOD> It's just an interesting condition
<GOOD> So can you just hear colours?
<GOOD> Or like do you have multiple things like tasting sounds or something
<GOOD> I can sort of wrap my head around colours
<GOOD> Does this happen with many things?
<GOOD> Or is it just some smells
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> Do stronger smells make it louder?
<GOOD> Well that sucks, sorry again for the bad reaction
<GOOD> I just haven't met anyone with it before so it piqued my stupid ass interest
<GOOD> It was just interesting to ask about
<GOOD> I imagine it's like tinnitus and my dad hates that
<GOOD> I have 2 games to play now
<GOOD> Very happy
<GOOD> And my emulators if they would just WORK
<GOOD> Dragonball fighterz
<GOOD> Those are the 2
<GOOD> Also what is the screen on this controller for
<GOOD> How does it work
<GOOD> I've never seen a dreamcast in action
<GOOD> I wanna play SA1 and 2 today but my emulator isn't working
<GOOD> Holy fuck the preview for the next OP episode looks fantastic
<GOOD> The animation oml
<GOOD> Yeah I absolutely love what they've done with it, and they seem to be taking liberties in the best way by doing stuff like Gum Gum counterblow
<GOOD> In the preview here we see him fly as like a beam of light too which wasn't in the manga
<GOOD> It can't live up to the hype imo
<GOOD> It can be good but it will never please everyone
<GOOD> Especially since it'll most likely be something only of significance to people who read it
<GOOD> Which means that the wider anime community won't feel it as much
<GOOD> I just think it's a poneglyph of the story of joyboy, and something to destroy the red line or something of that sort (there was a theory I REALLY liked but I forgot what it was, and it explained why Roger was too early)
<GOOD> One Piece is just a bunch of islands
<GOOD> Like the entire world
<GOOD> It's just islands and archipelagos as far as we know
<GOOD> One Piece has basically none like that tho
<GOOD> The biggest are countries like Alabasta
<GOOD> But they aren't that big
<GOOD> I mean only like 1-2 chapters ago we saw that ||the sea level rose when Mother Flame was used||
<GOOD> There had to be some sort of purging going on
<GOOD> I think figuring out ||what Mother Flame does|| is the key to cracking One Piece as a whole
<GOOD> Godddd I love One Piece theorising
<GOOD> It gives me life
<GOOD> The prevailing theory I believe the One Piece is (partially) is ||the memories/happiness of joyboy||, although there are missing pieces
<GOOD> So I'm really confused about it
<GOOD> I like that theory a lot, is that from how ||Imu is a silhouette  and crossed out the map?||
<GOOD> My theory is really just basic and that they have an akuma-akuma no mi
<GOOD> Or something like that
<GOOD> The devil-devil fruit
<GOOD> That's one that's a bit rougher for me
<GOOD> I have no idea as to Blackbeard
<GOOD> My biggest mysteries rn are Blackbeard, the giant straw hat and why Roger was too early
<GOOD> I can't crack them
<GOOD> Like I have no idea what they could be
<GOOD> You were a mod
<GOOD> It's kinda stressful as usual ig
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yeah that theory lines up with his funky teeth
<GOOD> But the prevailing theory is either that he is triplets (which makes some sense), or that he has a kraken/cerberus fruit
<GOOD> I personally love the kraken theory
<GOOD> Because Blackbeard's teeth placement shift around very often
<GOOD> And Oda isn't usually inconsistent with details
<GOOD> He has different teeth placement, suggesting there is more than one of him
<GOOD> There are specifically 3 teeth placements he has iirc
<GOOD> Full mouth, 2 missing from top and bottom, 2 missing from top and 1 from bottom
<GOOD> Yeah lmao
<GOOD> That's literally the theory
<GOOD> That Blackbeard is hiding his other triplets inside him and they tag out
<GOOD> He can like create a pocket dimension
<GOOD> Yeah that
<GOOD> That also
<GOOD> First off, boring
Second off, DB powerscaling is so poor that Luffy probably loses to a saibaman
<GOOD> If not even less
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> This man takes infinite punishment
<GOOD> He got punched by Whitebeard and lived
<GOOD> Like jesus christ he lived through this pretty comfortably
<GOOD> Plus the punch immediately after
<GOOD> The one that almost took Akainu out
<GOOD> Just kinda is
<GOOD> Like a car
<GOOD> Uh gear 2 is kinda(?) Like a piston in a car
<GOOD> So it could be because of that
<GOOD> Gear 2 was the first transformation
<GOOD> The transformation is him pumping all his blood into his legs, compressing it and releasing to race around his body
<GOOD> Like how internal combustion engines do that
<GOOD> He would but his veins are more elastic than usual
<GOOD> Him trying to think of names for attacks mid battle with Kaido was hilarious
<GOOD> Also hai autumn
<GOOD> Wait Skarm what was that patch you said to put on MH 1
<GOOD> Oh ok (I just wanted to play it out of interest)
<GOOD> Nah issokay
<GOOD> It's just that people make it sound hellish
<GOOD> I mostly chose 1 because I wanted something that I could run on PC
<GOOD> I played World
<GOOD> I bought cult of the lamb for half of that
<GOOD> I can afford to emulate it if it's free lmao
<GOOD> Also my dreamcast emu isn't working
<GOOD> Ffs
<GOOD> Okok
<GOOD> Ty
<GOOD> Fantastic looking game
<GOOD> I'm waiting to buy it tn
<GOOD> Rn
<GOOD> It's soooo cool
<GOOD> Actually that's me
<GOOD> (I have rizz frfr)
<GOOD> I want this game
<GOOD> I am bad at talking to women, it does not mean I fear them
<GOOD> Well not all of them
<GOOD> Some women are scary
<GOOD> Chica FNAF
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> I want hugs frfr
<GOOD> I only hug close friends
<GOOD> Or friends
<GOOD> What do I call my cult
<GOOD> In cult of the lamb
<GOOD> Hai autumn
<GOOD> I'm so bored
<GOOD> Guess who the latest gacha unit is
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> He's so fucking silly
<GOOD> A gear 5 1v1 is a stalemate
<GOOD> Oooo
<GOOD> I love Cult of the Lamb so far
<GOOD> I didn't expect to enjoy the balance
<GOOD> My cult loves me so far
<GOOD> They've been fully fed and faithful the entire time
<GOOD> Because I've been shovelling their shit day and night lmao
<GOOD> Cult of Snrubulu because I couldn't think of anything
<GOOD> Hai Lumi
<GOOD> Well now you're in bed so doesn't matter as much
<GOOD> Omg non imposter
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Mmmmm I have a new game to hyperfixate on ig
<GOOD> Idk whether to download a MH game or an Armoured Core game first tomorrow
<GOOD> Might download Armoured Core 1
<GOOD> Freedom or Freedom Unite
<GOOD> Oh wait
<GOOD> You didn't reply to the MH comment sorry
<GOOD> I'm hyper fixating on Cult of the Lamb
<GOOD> Goober
<GOOD> None of my mfs have died without me sacrificing them yet
<GOOD> Also I can marry cultists together now
<GOOD> Slay
<GOOD> Oh right I haven't bought PC Minecraft yet
<GOOD> I probably should
<GOOD> Not really because it's pretty expensive
<GOOD> And you can't buy the versions separate
<GOOD> I just want Java
<GOOD> I already own it on PS4
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Back
<GOOD> Hai Lumi Vill Sophie and Aria
<GOOD> I EATED it all
<GOOD> I didn't know you were here
<GOOD> Nvm if they're from Iceland you can have them
<GOOD> I'll cook you all 6 and throw them into 1 massive pot noodle
<GOOD> Who invited Kyurem
<GOOD> I'm scared of her
<GOOD> Mmm futurama posting
<GOOD> I am bender, please insert girder
Well looks like we have a new office cut-up!
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Hai Skarm and Aria hru
<GOOD> Very bored but otherwise fine, wbu
<GOOD> Oh?
<GOOD> That's fantastic to hear
<GOOD> Aww
<GOOD> That's nice
<GOOD> So like I heard Dream won an award for being the best gaming youtuber of this year
<GOOD> Bro uploaded 3 minecraft videos this year
<GOOD> Or Markiplier
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> He also frequently donates large amounts of money to charity
<GOOD> Apparently this stuff
<GOOD> The X means who won obv
<GOOD> No idea
<GOOD> Aphmau rings a bell kinda
<GOOD> I think Tommy is debatable even if I don't like him
<GOOD> He makes somewhat consistent content and actually does things
<GOOD> Honestly it's pretty crazy that the original image of Jeff the Killer has never been dug up
<GOOD> The image that was edited to make Jeff the Killer
<GOOD> Yeah but we don't know who made the image
<GOOD> Or even where its origin is
<GOOD> People have even reported it going back as far as 2004
<GOOD> Also apparently the original head for the smile dog image is from this image
<GOOD> Which is hilarious
<GOOD> Bro is flabbergasted
<GOOD> I wouldn't be so sure tbh, we've gotten very close matches
<GOOD> Yeah because digging up almost 20 year old 4chan threads isn't exactly easy
<GOOD> It's very odd how such a notorious image can just be lost
<GOOD> I kinda wish I was around for the more wild west era of the internet
<GOOD> It seemed fun
<GOOD> Also holy hell FNAF is now old enough to be the Pokmon fandom
<GOOD> Also Skarm, how does a dreamcast controller work
<GOOD> Like I know this sounds stupid, but why isn't there a right stick or anything
<GOOD> Like what is this, why is there a button and a screen
<GOOD> What does the button and the screen do
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> So like, is there just a reset camera button
<GOOD> Like with M64
<GOOD> Are you like 30 or smth?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That is very cool
<GOOD> I hope my dreamcast emu works soon so I can actually fucking play SA1 and SA2
<GOOD> Wait I remember my issue
<GOOD> I needed a specific type of ROM to work on the emu and I couldn't find it
<GOOD> So I can't play SA1 and 2 yet
<GOOD> SA1 and 2
<GOOD> Somic
<GOOD> The more I hear about Sega consoles they just seem like a victim of the game library it had
<GOOD> Like I don't know much about Sega consoles, especially not Dreamcast and Saturn
<GOOD> But yeah basically I need chd ROMs that are combination bin and gpi files, which I can't find
<GOOD> So I'll put playing Sonic on hold
<GOOD> Yeah I can't like, name a sega saturn game
<GOOD> So that's pretty telling
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Yeah I can't name that game
<GOOD> Idk, is jet set radio on the saturn?
<GOOD> Or like a Sonic game or smth
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I can't name any then
<GOOD> Kinda sucks I can't play Dreamcast games yet
<GOOD> Hai Sophie
<GOOD> Also no
<GOOD> So like did the Saturn exist at all
<GOOD> Sega cannot fool me this is just a Genesis controller
<GOOD> The Saturn never existed
<GOOD> I really wanna play them
<GOOD> But I think all the games I legally obtain from a legal place aren't the right type of file
<GOOD> Which is upsetting
<GOOD> Because it's gonna take ages to find a 2nd legal dispensary of the correct type of file
<GOOD> I'm ngl I didn't know that
<GOOD> I thought Saturn was so bad it killed Sega
<GOOD> Which is why I never heard of it
<GOOD> I like the first
<GOOD> How, it didn't have any games
<GOOD> My dog is 10 now
<GOOD> She loves sleeping
<GOOD> Starting MH Freedom rn
<GOOD> Imma try hammer this time I think
<GOOD> G?
<GOOD> This is Freedom PSP
<GOOD> And I technically started with World, I just wanted the full experience
<GOOD> Yeah I wanna go through 1 entry in each
<GOOD> There's something about old jank (not unplayable jank) that's cool to see dissolve away
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I cooked (after fucking up cooking multiple times)
<GOOD> Mmmm crafting tutorial
<GOOD> Idk whether to use Hammer or Lance
<GOOD> Just had an embarrassing af fight with a pig
<GOOD> Yuh
<GOOD> A boar is more accurate
<GOOD> My ass cannot play this game well yet
<GOOD> The lance seems fun but weird
<GOOD> Like the hop doesn't seem like you'll dodge anything
<GOOD> And the poke doesn't have a chain of pokes
<GOOD> Monster Hunter
<GOOD> But I don't have a combo
<GOOD> Pain but your red skirt is pretty
<GOOD> Hope you feel better tho
<GOOD> Ok tutorial over
<GOOD> I have 3 Armoured Core games lined up
<GOOD> Any PS1/PS2 game recommendations
<GOOD> Just while I'm here
<GOOD> I haven't played 1 through 7 tho
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> You reckon Jet set radio future for the Xbox is worth?
<GOOD> I can't find too many original Xbox titles I want
<GOOD> 'Advertised as The World's First 4D Action Game, Blinx is a third-person platform game'
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> So like, I heard IDW Sonic is meant to be good, do you think I should start
<GOOD> Uh, idk where
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is there like a resource for reading em online reliably
<GOOD> Oh ok that's good
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Peak is here
<GOOD> I imagine the Xbox port is better
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't have a USB GC controller so for now it's Xbox
<GOOD> Also for some reason Xbox Shadow the Hedgehog just... is funnier for no reason
<GOOD> I can't explain it I just think the cover makes it look even funnier
<GOOD> Aaaaaa all the ppl I usually talk to are offline
<GOOD> Or busy or ignoring me
<GOOD> I thought I could delete all of them as one
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Hi chat I'm installing a shitton of mods to Rivals of Aether to play with a friend
<GOOD> That's awful, I'm sorry
<GOOD> Ik it doesn't mean much but we all here to talk
<GOOD> Hi Sophie
<GOOD> Yo
<GOOD> Hai rosie
<GOOD> Still eepy?
<GOOD> I'm eepy too
<GOOD> It's late

<GOOD> It's understandable
<GOOD> These things take time
<GOOD> You can't force it
<GOOD> Am playing D&D later
<GOOD> Finishing my camlaign
<GOOD> Campaign
<GOOD> Young Sheldon is currently on my television, why must you torture me
<GOOD> We can only hope
<GOOD> Afton family
<GOOD> I finish my D&D campaign today one way or another
<GOOD> my friend rambled to me for like an hour and a half straight about how good Gen U is and now I want to buy it preowned
<GOOD> The main selling point on GU for me is the sheer quantity of monsters
<GOOD> Doubt the PC runs it
<GOOD> Plus I want to play with people
<GOOD> Aaaaa I hate wanting games
<GOOD> I'm stoopid
<GOOD> I wanna play w friends so I'll prob wait to buy
<GOOD> With switch or other emus
<GOOD> I se
<GOOD> See
<GOOD> I'm excited for the Mario Direct today
<GOOD> Yeah

<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Feddy
<GOOD> I'm very happy Springbonnie is in this movie
<GOOD> My favorite animatronic
<GOOD> At least we have blue toad
<GOOD> Me omw to call my university for like the 6th fucking time this month
<GOOD> I'm not gay but hi
<GOOD> I just sorted out how my student loans are gonna be paid
<GOOD> Also I found out I'm living off approx 100 per week for just basic maintenance stuff which is great
<GOOD> Now to budget all my meals
<GOOD> I'm aiming for spending under 50 a week on food
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Rip, was looking forward to egg fried rice
<GOOD> I will simply find something else to fry this rice
<GOOD> Wonder if it'll be cheaper to buy local meat and eggs
<GOOD> That's how it is generally here
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Fellas my cult isn't doing so good
<GOOD> They all took shrooms and now half of them are on bed rest
<GOOD> I am rolling in it rn
<GOOD> Ordered MH gen u
<GOOD> I wanna try gunlance
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Am finally home and able to relax
<GOOD> I was training
<GOOD> I had to carry a bag full of pots and pans home inside my bag
<GOOD> For university
<GOOD> Oh no
<GOOD> I'm almost able to use G5
<GOOD> Also D if you're playing hmu for advice on stuff
<GOOD> Heheheha
<GOOD> Also I just had to carry a match so hard
<GOOD> Hai Rosie
<GOOD> Hru
<GOOD> Bad but it's whatever
<GOOD> My day was slightly lifted by the fact that this is unedited
<GOOD> Sorry for ping
<GOOD> Yeah but thas an old ass game
<GOOD> Yeah but where are the achievement tracker things from
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Eh, the first one fell off at the end
<GOOD> I'm getting a MH game first too
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> For like 20 from CEX
<GOOD> I didn't get far through it
<GOOD> The final stretch really put me off
<GOOD> Uh everything on the way up to the castle
<GOOD> Bwario and Bwaluigi was a breaking point tho
<GOOD> The first appearance
<GOOD> Because both are pretty ass
<GOOD> Had to use extra health for both bc otherwise they would just nuke me
<GOOD> Oh yeah that too
<GOOD> Usually they have overpriced crap but like sometimes it's alright
<GOOD> Pokemon Firered:
<GOOD> You gotta hit the balance of old and irrelevant but not too old and too irrelevant it becomes retro or a collector's item
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Basically once you hit non-shovelware DS games you're paying too much at CEX
<GOOD> The Gamecube section is alr
<GOOD> Got this for 50
<GOOD> Pounds
<GOOD> So like 60 dollars
<GOOD> It's like average price but I really wanted it
<GOOD> I don't really collect games but I think GC would be the one I wanna collect
<GOOD> My GC is fine yeah
<GOOD> Was a bargain too
<GOOD> I traded in a bunch of PS4 games I'll never play again to a local dude
<GOOD> The GC with controller was 40 lmao
<GOOD> It's silver
<GOOD> Then I got Metroid Prime from him for 20
<GOOD> And that's the price trend for MOST GC games
<GOOD> Not fucking Chibi Robo
<GOOD> Only like 5 because pricey
<GOOD> Cumulatively it starts stacking up in price
<GOOD> Too many franchises I wanna get into rip
<GOOD> I've had an unfortunate childhood with Sonic
<GOOD> I played Unleashed... on the Wii, Secret Rings, Mario and Sonic, Sonic Rush(?) DS, the DS Sonic RPG, and Sonic Rivals 2
<GOOD> The only good Sonics I played as a kid were colours and Black Knight
<GOOD> Then later I played Mania and Generations (and Forces but you know)
<GOOD> Worked on kid me
<GOOD> Also I never got more than 1 level into Wii Unleashed because I sucked at it
<GOOD> So I just played the first Werehog section constantly
<GOOD> I already said but after I finish HxH I'm gonna read the IDW Sonic comics
<GOOD> Does Sonic genuinely have a good game that isn't Generations or Mania
<GOOD> Oh also Spinball
<GOOD> I have a childhood memory of my dad actually tilting at Mean Bean Machine btw
<GOOD> Like shouting
<GOOD> It's a core memory
<GOOD> A friend I used to have got mad at me for saying Sonic and Pokemon fans are similar
<GOOD> It was very funny
<GOOD> They also have massive divides where they either hate modern/retro era or all of the games
<GOOD> Fun fact I only remember the boring parts of Generations
<GOOD> And idk why
<GOOD> Like the final boss and the Shadow fight
<GOOD> Also as a kid I grew up watching Sonic Underground (peak)
<GOOD> I watched this ep as a child
<GOOD> Very goofy
<GOOD> Also I was so pissed off and thought I missed an ep where Sonic found his mom
<GOOD> And later I found out he just didn't
<GOOD> They have the whole song in discord gif search btw
<GOOD> Also as a kid I saw like the other Sonic cartoon once
<GOOD> And thought that the ep was still sonic Underground
<GOOD> And I thought that Tails got introduced to Underground
<GOOD> Me remembering these 2 side characters exist
<GOOD> Sleet and Dingo my beloved
<GOOD> I watched a bit of that
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> Omg
<GOOD> This is funy memey
<GOOD> Fanf posting
<GOOD> Indeed
<GOOD> Of course
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Springbonnie is my favourite animatronic
<GOOD> So I'm eating well
<GOOD> I mean springtrap isn't my fave, he kinda got the shaft by not being anywhere ever
<GOOD> Springbonnie that is
<GOOD> In a FNAF 3 minigame yes
<GOOD> And he looked so funny
<GOOD> This rabbit is fucked up bruh
<GOOD> They're fangame designs but the one on the left is my favourite fangame design ever
<GOOD> That's fair
<GOOD> I like how he looks better in the doors
<GOOD> Have you seen this fangame
<GOOD> It's super good
<GOOD> That's true tho
<GOOD> The FNAF 1 designs are really weird
<GOOD> In plus
<GOOD> Oh also this fangame has the best Puppet design hands down
<GOOD> I love his jester hat
<GOOD> Heheheha
<GOOD> Deserved
<GOOD> When you shine the light on him the bells on the hat make a noise every time
<GOOD> Fair enough
<GOOD> I'm holding out hopes for Popgoes
<GOOD> Fun fact I've never played a FNAF fangame
<GOOD> Or beaten a normal FNAF game
<GOOD> Genuinely because I'm too bad at them
<GOOD> I'm so bad at FNAF games, they're genuinely difficult at times
<GOOD> I'm just too bad at them
<GOOD> Oh also the other games are fine, but 4 makes me hyperventilate
<GOOD> I really hate it
<GOOD> Nightmares are fine, the setting and the breathing make me too nervous
<GOOD> Begin audio prompt in 3 2 1
<GOOD> The audio freaks me out and apparently you can be jumpscared even when you're looking at them
<GOOD> But 3 equally spaced shocks is enough basically always so
<GOOD> I've watched em
<GOOD> I just misremembered
<GOOD> I haven't bought SB
<GOOD> And I'm ngl playing Ruin doesn't seem fun
<GOOD> My friend listened to me injure myself in FNAF VR
<GOOD> Can't be night 5
<GOOD> I couldn't play the first correctly because I was using dualshock controller
<GOOD> It was awful
<GOOD> I know that glitch
<GOOD> Yeah but like whatever it's classed as
<GOOD> 2 fps means they never get enough movement opportunities and the night ends without them arriving
<GOOD> I thought that was how it worked
<GOOD> Ugh I'm a fucking idiot
<GOOD> Acting like I know shit
<GOOD> Idk I think I'm having an overly emotional day for no reason
<GOOD> It sucks
<GOOD> Yeah but I should know this shit, I just thought oh it's linked to Foxy so logically all the other mechanics miss because frames too
<GOOD> Yeah you have to be watching him during his movement opportunity to stop him iirc
<GOOD> Otherwise he takes it
<GOOD> So in green runs I'm fairly sure people flick their cameras up perfectly on either Foxy or Freddy for like half a second
<GOOD> Timing it with the countdown
<GOOD> 1500 frames for Foxy I assume
<GOOD> Or whatever metric they use for movement
<GOOD> Guys let's all play FNAC 2 it's so good trust
<GOOD> The entire game totally isn't trivialised by literally just pressing buttons randomly
<GOOD> But the game is piss easy anyway
<GOOD> Penguin barely matters
<GOOD> And Rat is even easier than the other nights
<GOOD> Yeah that's why FNAC 3 took a while
<GOOD> Yeah but it's like, not a big deal ever
<GOOD> Because even if they get into the centre room they don't get there fast enough
<GOOD> So you can just ring the phone again
<GOOD> The only issue is penguin on a later night (ludicrously hard to dodge) and Chester yeah
<GOOD> Or Cat
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Bar of soap
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure the book series wasn't made when they were 13
<GOOD> That's where super cancer comes from
<GOOD> Ok but like, the FNAF books aren't much better
<GOOD> Super Cancer vs Faz Goo who wins
<GOOD> So tempted to send the matpat image rn
<GOOD> I won't
<GOOD> When I was 13 I bought a series of unofficial FNAF books off ebay so like
<GOOD> Now I own the entire Diary of a Wimpy Foxy series
<GOOD> It has spelling errors and all of it is written in like size 28 font
<GOOD> I read Minecraft zombie
<GOOD> But I had a massive minecraft book phase
<GOOD> Embarrassed to say I loved this series
<GOOD> Not this one tho it was pretty peak
<GOOD> Audio book incoming (also no these books are long as fuck)
<GOOD> Yeah it's bad
<GOOD> If I find diary of a wimpy foxy I will do a reading stream
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Dw it's unofficial
<GOOD> Also this gameknight999 thing is hilarious
<GOOD> The premise is literally that the main character is a minecraft piss baby troll and he gets isekaid into minecraft
<GOOD> And then like it turns into Minecraft Story Mode level storytelling
<GOOD> No he got shot by a laser or smth
<GOOD> I didn't follow the episode 2 story I just remember some mf using dev commands
<GOOD> I own so many odd books
<GOOD> Thank you charity shops
<GOOD> (No, the iconic comic is not in this book)
<GOOD> Although I wish it was
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's dated to say the least
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> A lot of the comics rebound and become hilarious tho
<GOOD> No but that's a throwback
<GOOD> I wish Loss was in this book
<GOOD> That would make it a collector's item
<GOOD> Guys who wants this book off amazon
<GOOD> Also I fucking found the books
<GOOD> They're still on amazon
<GOOD> Also Stampy is not in that book
<GOOD> You'll have to wait for my audio book
<GOOD> Also if this wasn't obvious it's like a 13 year old's fanfic
<GOOD> It's not that bad but it's certainly bad
<GOOD> One of the books is just Foxy talking to a self insert night guard and then at the end they just fucking die lmao
<GOOD> I will do impressions and a very poor storyteller voice also
<GOOD> Like a Hallmark movie narrator
<GOOD> So like does anyone else remember this or just me
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I kinda skimmed over it idk the actual plot but Golden Freddy with a sledgehammer is funny
<GOOD> Old fnaf theories were always so fun tbh
<GOOD> Like looking back and seeing people think the phone guy was important or that purple guy was phone guy was so simple
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Quite erm, uncanny of you
<GOOD> Hihi
<GOOD> That didn't take long
<GOOD> Now I don't have to play SV
<GOOD> There's enough Mewtwo in SV
<GOOD> Shadow ball would have fucked me up
<GOOD> Also I'm getting MH 3 Ultimate rn
<GOOD> Well hopefully
<GOOD> Water Spout Kyogre
<GOOD> Oh fuck that would be evil
<GOOD> Forcing you to bring a ground mon to a water raid
<GOOD> Heat Crash Groudon
<GOOD> Arceus raids where the type varies
<GOOD> As does the moveset
<GOOD> Trying to find out what kind of duck this is rn
<GOOD> Wait wrong duck
<GOOD> That's a crested grebe
<GOOD> Roar of time is free frfr
<GOOD> Just wait for Giratina with will o wisp and resto chesto
<GOOD> Skarm I'm getting 3 Ultimate
<GOOD> I hated playing BotW so am glad I gave TotK a chance
<GOOD> It was fun
<GOOD> It was because BotW's open world was painfully plain and underused
<GOOD> Emu
<GOOD> I don't own a Wii U
<GOOD> There wasn't anything to... do
<GOOD> And it isn't as good
<GOOD> Hm the Wii U rom isn't working
<GOOD> Lemme try again
<GOOD> Trying to see if my emu is working rn
<GOOD> How long is a wii u game meant to load for
<GOOD> Because it's taking multiple minutes of nothing
<GOOD> I have no idea what
<GOOD> Ughhhh I hate figuring out emus
<GOOD> Emulators are so annoying
<GOOD> Back
<GOOD> Took a break from emulators because they all seem to have one error or another
<GOOD> Xemu and Cemu are the ones with mistakes
<GOOD> Project64 has an issue I'm ignoring
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Oh Starfield is blowing up for the wrong reasons
<GOOD> Fantastic
<GOOD> They ask for PRONOUNS in the character creator
<GOOD> How could they
<GOOD> Bro this impact frame
<GOOD> They made it a manga panel
<GOOD> And it defaults to he/him and she/her
<GOOD> But people are fuming that you can change it apparently lmao
<GOOD> You know how people are
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> There's a vid going around of a bald man screaming for 3 minutes about pronouns in Starfield and it's sad but very funny
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Yeah that lmao
<GOOD> Gimme some
<GOOD> They/Them jumpscare
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure it's also just in a random menu
<GOOD> Like they don't prompt you for this it's an option
<GOOD> I've never shouted at a game oddly enough
<GOOD> If I'm incredibly mad I end up bruising my leg tho
<GOOD> If I'm incredibly mad then yes I'll spontaneously punch my leg
<GOOD> Because I don't want to break something
<GOOD> No but that would be funny
<GOOD> Me forming bruises out of fury
<GOOD> I'm too frail to do that
<GOOD> Yeah I've never destroyed something of mine
<GOOD> Punching my leg is fiiiine
<GOOD> It only happens occasionally and it heals up nicely
<GOOD> Plus like I've only bruised it like 3 times
<GOOD> Also Marine Biology on Twitter has found me
<GOOD> I don't have healthy outlets
<GOOD> Or hobbies or anything
<GOOD> Like drawing just makes me mad
<GOOD> Because I'm bad at drawing
<GOOD> I haven't tho, am still immature
<GOOD> Oh right I was gonna try and sort out a weekly shopping budget this week
<GOOD> I wanna be happy soon :<
<GOOD> I went for one this morning, very serene
<GOOD> But then this afternoon I thought about life for like half an hour and it ruined my day
<GOOD> And money
<GOOD> (I hate money because I don't own any)
<GOOD> Omg they're so androgynous it's like a man and a woman had a baby
<GOOD> Oooooo I'm a girlkisser
<GOOD> I'm sorry :<
<GOOD> Oooo yummy
<GOOD> How could the WOKE themsplain their wokegenda into Starfield like this
<GOOD> Sick library vibes
<GOOD> I won't be soon
<GOOD> I'm so eepy
<GOOD> X_X
<GOOD> No, bed too comfy
<GOOD> Like a blahaj?
<GOOD> Also I tried emulating Shadow and the audio layered and fucked up
<GOOD> Ooo comfy
<GOOD> I really need to read the FNAF comics
<GOOD> They seem funny af
<GOOD> Funtime Foxy has no spirit iirc
<GOOD> Or at least no specific one idk if they have remnant
<GOOD> What is he doing in a car
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure the actual context is that minireenas are entering his body while he's passed out
<GOOD> r/truerateme is funny af
<GOOD> I was trying to find the WB gif because it fits better
<GOOD> erm overrate
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure truerateme is just awful anyway
<GOOD> Probably incels tho
<GOOD> Ew generalisation
<GOOD> Hihi
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I still don't understand what Homestuck is after all this time
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Uh oh
<GOOD> Might play AC1 tomorrow
<GOOD> Or trying to find my SSBU main
<GOOD> No I don't like assassin game
<GOOD> If I had a GameCube controller yes
<GOOD> But alas, no
<GOOD> Undertale if DARK and GRITTY
<GOOD> Direct leaks are starting oh no
<GOOD> Yeah, leaks
<GOOD> As in the leaker that leaks directs with 100% accuracy is leaking this Direct
<GOOD> Bait used to be believable
<GOOD> I can only get lv 9 CPUs to 1 stock because they keep perfectly flashguarding and dodging everything
<GOOD> Yeah today isn't my day for trying to play Smash
<GOOD> I cried at Brook
<GOOD> I was upset about all of them except Zoro
<GOOD> Me during Tesoro backstory
<GOOD> I didn't care about that death lmao
<GOOD> Unless you mean the other one in the exact same arc
<GOOD> No thanks
<GOOD> I just thought he was kinda stupid
<GOOD> He pretty much ||died to a your mom joke||
<GOOD> I was upset at ||Whitebeard|| tho
<GOOD> Robin's is second for me, Brook broke me
<GOOD> Zesty bestie
<GOOD> He designed that egg mf in WCI
<GOOD> Yeah but like was Oda high or smth
<GOOD> But OP is all oddballs
<GOOD> But Croc already looks pretty silly
<GOOD> Also he owns bananagators lmao
<GOOD> He's so androgynous he's like if a man and a woman had a baby
<GOOD> Yamato is the only person above Perona for me
<GOOD> Not character wise tho
<GOOD> Idk my favourite OP character
<GOOD> Cracker is probably there somewhere
<GOOD> They're just ok
<GOOD> Jinbe is in my top 3
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> Moria is floating around up there
<GOOD> Jinbe Usopp Brook in that order
<GOOD> Actually maybe Chopper above Brook
<GOOD> I think my ranking goes
Jinbe
Usopp
Chopper
Brook
Luffy
Franky 
Sanji
Nami
Robin
Zoro
<GOOD> I don't like Zoro
<GOOD> Just ever
<GOOD> I don't have a favourite character that is also hot because Yamato isn't very cool
<GOOD> Saaaame
<GOOD> Oh I like Blackbeard and his crew a lot
<GOOD> Maybe my favourite crew
<GOOD> I like because of recent chapters
<GOOD> And in general
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> I just like the crew a lot, their designs are cool
<GOOD> I doubt they'll die
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Ughhhh like 5 more days until spoilers
<GOOD> I wanna see FIGHTING
<GOOD> I have my eye on Imu rn
<GOOD> Could end up as a favourite character
<GOOD> I don't have a top 3
<GOOD> Law isn't toooooo hot
<GOOD> Very cool tho
<GOOD> I love his design and he has my favourite DF
<GOOD> Probably top 3 characters actually
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Idk I'm not attracted to men
<GOOD> Oh actually, I do have a hot character from new arc
<GOOD> I think the ppl that like men are simping for ||Shaka|| but I'm simping for ||York|| frfr
<GOOD> Sorta
<GOOD> It gave me straight thoughts frfr
<GOOD> I also forgot that happened
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That sounds awful
<GOOD> Trying to learn basic cell shading
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I can't say here
<GOOD> Sorry
<GOOD> Yes but what is it showing
<GOOD> Uh
<GOOD> I was already super stressed and upset, I got my ass beat by a friend in Smash and blew up at them because I'm a bitch
<GOOD> Now am lying in bed crying
<GOOD> I blew up because they were chatting shit, I said they didn't know how to play their character and check their ego and we just kept doubling down
<GOOD> Also because I projected stress on someone that didn't deserve it
<GOOD> I don't deserve to
<GOOD> Also I found out my worst matchup
<GOOD> Also that Inkling fucking sucks on FD style stages
<GOOD> Final Destination
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> My breaking point was getting aerial juggled on FD by my friend playing Puff
<GOOD> Since I couldn't do anything except let them spam aerials
<GOOD> My worst matchup is actually meta knight apparently
<GOOD> They'd just catch me in landing lag
<GOOD> They were spamming shorthop aerials
<GOOD> I mostly got mad because they were doing like 1 thing per character
<GOOD> For MK they used the teleport whenever I used neutral b
<GOOD> Which was literally just a free kill move
<GOOD> They main Mewtwo, Meta Knight Kirby and Puff
<GOOD> Meta knight
<GOOD> As Mewtwo they literally just threw projectile--> running attack
<GOOD> And then went and camped the other side of the stage again
<GOOD> They aren't
<GOOD> But I called them out on that and they called me salty so
<GOOD> Yeah but they doubled down constantly so I blew up
<GOOD> ~~called me pathetic for telling them they should learn more moves~~
<GOOD> Boo womp
<GOOD> To be fair my bread and butter rn is splat bomb as inkling
<GOOD> But then again I've only played inkling for like 3 hours
<GOOD> Every time I play Wario and go back to inkling I keep spamming Dair
<GOOD> Dair is just such a fun Wario move
<GOOD> I love dairs that make you into a drill fd
<GOOD> Fr
<GOOD> I drinked it all
<GOOD> I'm not good enough at good fast falling yet
<GOOD> Yeah but Puff is disgusting
<GOOD> Puff makes me violent
<GOOD> All their attacks come out so fast
<GOOD> Their hitboxes are too big compared to their body
<GOOD> It just makes me very angry
<GOOD> They're too fast
<GOOD> It really doesn't matter
<GOOD> Because I've realised Inkling doesn't have many kill moves
<GOOD> Their best kill move is up air and trying to connect that against puff is impossible
<GOOD> Bair isn't a kill move
<GOOD> It's a good move but not a kill move
<GOOD> Also I got killed by Mewtwo Fair at like 70-90 and it made me scream
<GOOD> Also also, when I tried using bair/fair they jusy outranged me with their own fair
<GOOD> Idk, I feel like I should stick w ink
<GOOD> It's not that easy
<GOOD> It's pretty big
<GOOD> Plus I was fighting with lag
<GOOD> Which kept causing me to face in the wrong direction or just eating my tilts/aerials
<GOOD> I can't even use my aerials well yet
<GOOD> Usually when I'm in the air I'm waiting to get back down
<GOOD> Because I keep fucking getting juggled
<GOOD> Like when I was fighting puff
<GOOD> If I teched into the ground? Fair
If I landed and rolled? Bair
If I tried to go straight down? Fair the second I land
<GOOD> Puff is too damn fast for me
<GOOD> Like the landing lag is genuinely enough for them to hop again
<GOOD> Evening
<GOOD> Haiii
<GOOD> Me making Eberron NPC names in D&D
<GOOD> An unbelievable amount for how he looks
<GOOD> The warioware and rhythm heaven art director just drew DDLC fanart
<GOOD> Can't say I expected it
<GOOD> They are now because Wario is there
<GOOD> Monica will get angry but then Wario rushes in and confirms up tilt into waft to kill
<GOOD> Curating my twitter timeline to not be horrible is hard :((
<GOOD> So much hatefulness
<GOOD> Yeah but I do want to see funny fish so I will keep
<GOOD> Just annoying to see awful opinions being genuinely loved
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Hai Ryan hru
<GOOD> I passed out and woke up very very late
<GOOD> So am glad it's Sunday
<GOOD> I wanna play pimin today
<GOOD> Man I wanna play this new PS5 game that's coming but it's exclusive and I'm leaving my PS4 here when I move anyway
<GOOD> Gotta hope I can soup up my PC to an acceptable level to play it there instead (I can't)
<GOOD> Ew valorant
<GOOD> Ko Takeuchi has quickly become my favourite twitter user
<GOOD> Moira?
<GOOD> It is still what it is
<GOOD> Very suprised I didn't cut myself just now
<GOOD> Did my first proper razor shave
<GOOD> Overwatch 2 is awful
<GOOD> Massive fumble
<GOOD> I think one of the worst decisions was making it 5v5 with no actual plan for how that would affect the game
<GOOD> And as it turns out if you have a game balanced around 6v6 and make it 5v5 it pans out awful
<GOOD> It is if your tank is ball or smth
<GOOD> A lot of tanks are straight up unusable if the enemy has a widow
<GOOD> Because you need a shield
<GOOD> But then your squishies are picked off
<GOOD> If ball dives to pick off squishies the entire team is vulnerable
<GOOD> Like, they didn't have the foresight to realise that picks like JQ and Hog would fall off by not actually being able to support
<GOOD> Well JQ can but they can't protect the team as much as is needed
<GOOD> My point is instead of making it 5v5, they should have made it 6v6 but you can only pick 1 shield tank
<GOOD> It stops the double shield meta of OW1 while still allowing the offensive tanks to actually do anything
<GOOD> Anyway am just waiting to play Pimin 2 now
<GOOD> I hate Orisa post rework
<GOOD> She's so annoying
<GOOD> I main ball
<GOOD> I don't like OW at all
<GOOD> If I were to learn a shooter it would be Splatoon
<GOOD> But I'm bad at Splatoon so
<GOOD> I should download league
<GOOD> I haven't yet
<GOOD> I need to find a new anime after Nichijou
<GOOD> Just cleared out my practice exams from college
<GOOD> Just killed like 50 pikmin and had to give up on a dungeon
<GOOD> They drowned, since I wanted them to be carried across by blue pikmin and they just didn't
<GOOD> Then a few were picked off by snagrets after
<GOOD> 2
<GOOD> Apparently the blue pimin have to be idle to do it
<GOOD> Yeah that just didn't happen
<GOOD> I'll just grow more idc
<GOOD> Oh lovely
<GOOD> I hate it when they make you navigate pikmin across narrow gaps
<GOOD> Snagret cave
<GOOD> Snagret hole? Idk
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I'm doing all of them anyway
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I thought it was some
<GOOD> I didn't
<GOOD> Navigating pikmin across a bridge above water is awful
<GOOD> Yeah but you can't take them to the next floor
<GOOD> I'm gonna go lie down.
<GOOD> /s   I'm not that pissed lmao
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> I can regrow some pimin
<GOOD> Only one I was annoyed about was losing my white ones
<GOOD> Why can't I be the person on the left
<GOOD> I'm 5'8, just don't wanna be trans (idk if being enby counts as trans)
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I can't tell whether I'm masc or fem but I'm gonna say masc fr
<GOOD> I mean it's better than the alternative of a massive fuck-off purple line through the middle lol
<GOOD> Becoming obsessed with Pikmin help
<GOOD> That's an enby thing?
<GOOD> So the new transformation is just SSJ2
<GOOD> I really don't get why Dragonball, Sonic and Spiderman fans are all the same person like half the time
<GOOD> Are top hats and suits a non binary thing because my ass gravitating to them so hard
<GOOD> Yeah but it's always those 3 in particular
<GOOD> >half the time
<GOOD> I guess Dragonball didn't give mfs enough weird colour changes
<GOOD> Why does Guilty Gear have such pretty women
<GOOD> Also that giant pirate hat and anchor made me want to main her
<GOOD> Yeah pretty much
<GOOD> Minus battle IQ
<GOOD> And AP
<GOOD> Ngl people that powerscale dragonball characters don't seem to have read it
<GOOD> I didn't say that
<GOOD> But people seem to think Goku is a ruthless killing machine
<GOOD> Broly stomps assuming that Goku fights him how he did last time
<GOOD> If this is Super Broly at least
<GOOD> But he doesn't kill them
<GOOD> Unless he has yo
<GOOD> He doesn't kill them because he doesn't want to kill people lmao
<GOOD> I mean he literally told him to leave and never come back
<GOOD> And Frieza turned that offer down and got killed because Goku had no other option
<GOOD> Yeah he did, 3 times
<GOOD> Actually 4 times
<GOOD> Not possible
<GOOD> It's a fusion of Goku and Vegeta, and Vegeta doesn't know MUI
<GOOD> He knows MUE
<GOOD> Gogeta isn't either of them
<GOOD> Gogeta and Vegito are separate entities to Goku and Vegeta
<GOOD> Gogeta has a bit more of Goku's personality ig but it wouldn't matter
<GOOD> Ultra Instinct is dodging on instinct and clearing your mind as a technique
<GOOD> Ultra Ego is taking attacks on purpose to strengthen yourself
<GOOD> I doubt they would even be able to fuse if they were both using it
<GOOD> Wrong idea
<GOOD> UI means you don't think about anything, you can't use them together
<GOOD> If you're angry (UE) you can't be calm (UI)
<GOOD> Unfortunately Ultra Ego is dog lmao
<GOOD> It looks cool but it's a bad transformation lol
<GOOD> I love Gotenks
<GOOD> Such a little shitter
<GOOD> Luffy can use Ultra Instinct already fr
<GOOD> Very true
<GOOD> Bro doesn't know what he wants to be
<GOOD> He just feels so weird, he wants to study and be a parent but can't make time to pick up his kid and spend time w her
<GOOD> And he wants to be a warrior but doesn't really put in effort but still gets it anyway
<GOOD> He went from being unable to sense ki to being one of the strongest canon characters in 1 hour
<GOOD> It feels like he's torn between fans wanting him to do fighter shit and what he's actually meant to be, a scholar
<GOOD> He doesn't really clarify that well, he just does a 16 moment again then is like yeah I trained offscreen
<GOOD> It was a mid movie but the animation and Piccolo/Pan were stellar so
<GOOD> Oh I was referring to when he says he randomly learned the Makensappo by training secretly or smth
<GOOD> And despite this still not being able to sense ki
<GOOD> Yeah but then he doesn't put the effort in to either properly train OR spend time w them
<GOOD> Piccolo has developed as a parental figure since now he doesn't beat up children and throw them in the woods
<GOOD> Yeah and the actual training he does do is to learn what amounts to a party trick
<GOOD> Makensappo is a sick technique but it's so bad
<GOOD> Though I will admit it has a 100% success rate
<GOOD> I mean Super is kinda really bad imo
<GOOD> But they make random characters catch up for hype by recycling old ones
<GOOD> Cell Max, Frieza 3 separate times, Broly (even if it's different to Z Broly thank fuck)
<GOOD> Oh Bardock also
<GOOD> Ironically the best villains in Super are original ones that fall off later because they try to go back to the basic formula halfway (like Moro)
<GOOD> Frieza is the weirdest to me if you've read the manga
<GOOD> He came back 3 times in Super alone so I'm kinda tired of him
<GOOD> He's not even the best villain in Z lmao
<GOOD> Nothing
<GOOD> I will never forgive them for ruining him
<GOOD> He could have been easily the best DBS villain
<GOOD> But then they threw it away
<GOOD> It's so odd that DBS hasn't acknowledged Uub at all
<GOOD> Bro Buu needs to be awake for a single arc for that to happen
<GOOD> Yeah but he doesn't do anything
<GOOD> They acknowledge he exists but not that he has ludicrous potential
<GOOD> I'm so tired of them sidelining him by making him sleep lmao
<GOOD> Isn't Pan like 5
<GOOD> Nvm she's 3
<GOOD> She's pretty strong
<GOOD> And she at least had something
<GOOD> I mean no one is ever helpful in super
<GOOD> I wish they let him die when he was obviously meant to
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> UUB FANS EATING
<GOOD> (I'm Uub fans)
<GOOD> Nah that punch was all they needed to eat good forever
<GOOD> He fought Sasaki and Senor Pink
<GOOD> Shiver
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Gen U arrives tomorrow
<GOOD> I will play Pimin to satiate myself till then
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I can't afford 3 or 4
<GOOD> I'm 40% through my debt
<GOOD> I shaved properly for the first time today and my face feels so weird still
<GOOD> Yeah I'm blind
<GOOD> As in gameplay
<GOOD> The only thing I know about this game apart from what I've played is a bulbmin
<GOOD> Also the pikpedia is so cool I love flicking through them
<GOOD> It reminds me of when I played yoshi island DS growing up
<GOOD> And they had the zoos of enemies I loved it
<GOOD> I just like watching them
<GOOD> Also I've recently taken to getting my pikmin to do menial shit while I beat up enemies with my bare hands
<GOOD> No time limit rocks
<GOOD> Peak
<GOOD> Also is 10k the total money you can accrue in the game
<GOOD> Not playing rn
<GOOD> Buy the 100 pikmin amiibo
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> What is sleeping for I don't get it
<GOOD> It makes Olimar eepy
<GOOD> But idk why it's sed
<GOOD> Used
<GOOD> That was in the first game?
<GOOD> I'm ngl I didn't know that it existed
<GOOD> What is the purpose lmao
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Are they faster than normal at carrying you or
<GOOD> That's too many amiibo
<GOOD> I am honestly motivated to begin on a pikmin shrine eventually
<GOOD> But not much merch of it exists in terms of figures and physical things afaik
<GOOD> Maybe buy a fanmade steelbook for the games or smth
<GOOD> The only plushie I want is the stupid olimar one
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> I need this
<GOOD> HE'S ONLY 15 ON THE NINTENDO STORE WHAT
<GOOD> There were pikmin vases but out of stock now
<GOOD> I'm looking at the us store
<GOOD> I would kill for this
<GOOD> I want these
<GOOD> Especially the Olimar ome
<GOOD> They're blind boxes
<GOOD> You can buy them online still iirc for like 15 dollars
<GOOD> Just look for the pikmin terrarium collection
<GOOD> What the fuck is that sound effect
<GOOD> It sounded like someone choking lmao
<GOOD> I haven't watched Mandela Catalogue and never plan to
<GOOD> Especially at midnight lmao
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Cute
<GOOD> OP live action peak frfr
<GOOD> Lucky smh
<GOOD> Almost 70% of my Pimin debt cleared
<GOOD> No fucking way
<GOOD> Ko Takeuchi is the art director for Warioware and Rhythm Heaven
<GOOD> Arin hanson is a member of Game grumps
<GOOD> They're heavenly
<GOOD> I love the Halloween ones
<GOOD> My intro week is gonna be sooooo hectic
<GOOD> I'm doing everything
<GOOD> Even optional
<GOOD> (Minus learning Welsh)
<GOOD> Heyoooo
<GOOD> Gex
<GOOD> Dark gritty storyline
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Whirlipede is based
<GOOD> Also is that a shiny thievul
<GOOD> From the creator of Toriel blocks the fucking way
<GOOD> It's a fangame
<GOOD> I hunta da monster
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> Gl with your estrogen thing btw Aria
<GOOD> Omg that's awesome
<GOOD> Am in the gym doing masculine manly men things rn (cardio)
<GOOD> Estrogen doesn't like expire right
<GOOD> Yeah tbf my dad just sees estrogen as like women juice
<GOOD> And when you drink the women juice you turn into a women
<GOOD> ~~Unfortunately his views on people taking it are~~
<GOOD> My dad is just kinda shitty about views on groups of people in general
<GOOD> My ass is never gonna try and explain what non binary is to him, let alone come out to him
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> My dad doesn't understand the concept of gender being different in the first place
<GOOD> Bro still thinks calling me a girl is an insult
<GOOD> If you attempt to talk about stuff like that he's just like shut up with that gender stuff and if you try and talk to him about most things he shouts over you and says you're arguing with him
<GOOD> So I've kinda just stopped giving him the time of day
<GOOD> I think my mom would probably not understand even if I explained but try and respect it
<GOOD> Which is very based of her
<GOOD> She's a very patient lady
<GOOD> Works to provide for us, tries her best to get things we like or want to the point we've basically just got an agreement that as long as we ask within reason we can usually have stuff
<GOOD> And it created a nice bit of respect since me and my brother don't ask beyond our means
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> Mr Beast bar deez nuts flavour RAAAA
<GOOD> My dad has told me before if I bring a boy home he's getting turned away and he regularly projects his fragile masculinity on us by trying to insult us for things like calling animals cute
<GOOD> I think that sometimes it's beyond reason
<GOOD> Issokay
<GOOD> What, for my whole life?
<GOOD> Yeah probably but if I burst that bubble he'd probably just be angry and more in denial
<GOOD> He's also just like, angry at everything
<GOOD> We have a dog next door that barks when we leave and enter the house and he threatened to kill it and put a brick through the owner's window (neither of which he said or did outside of the house thankfully)
<GOOD> He's all talk
<GOOD> Yeah pretty much
<GOOD> Not permanent, I come back between semesters
<GOOD> But it's gonna be such a nice break
<GOOD> DMs I'll tell you
<GOOD> Ngl I know nothing about Wales
<GOOD> Ok tbf I know that since the place I'm going is surrounded by mountains
<GOOD> And has a mountaineering society
<GOOD> I'm going to North Wales lol
<GOOD> Possibly the northest that Wales goes
<GOOD> Yeah it's near there
<GOOD> Ignore the secret base doxxing
<GOOD> Bruh
<GOOD> Sounds like my house
<GOOD> Erm how can I be homophobic, I'm not scared of gay people????????????
<GOOD> Me (fear of blood) when I tell my friends I'm a haemophobe (they misheard)
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> I have to ask tho are the instructors the ones making the comments
<GOOD> Good lmao
<GOOD> You can have an interview with me instead Aria
<GOOD> If you fail you die
<GOOD> I did 2 nights ago but my brother recently started secondary school and he gets up at 7am
<GOOD> And when anyone in my house is awake, I am usually also awake
<GOOD> I love waking up with those weird itchy red stripes across my body
<GOOD> (I still don't understand why I have them)
<GOOD> Apparently it's just a thing that happens
<GOOD> Sometimes they aren't itchy
<GOOD> They're just pink or red skin imprints
<GOOD> They aren't like injuries
<GOOD> Yeah that pretty much
<GOOD> This except there is no treasure cuz I have none and I'm just trolling
<GOOD> And I buried all my possessions in my back garden as a preparation
<GOOD> Live Ferrothorn reaction
<GOOD> Ferrothorn when he sees a gay couple
<GOOD> Jumpscare
<GOOD> They're too busy changing log by bolbs
<GOOD> Spoon have you seen the AI princess movie
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> She would like to show you a few tricks
<GOOD> Lemme find the sequel
<GOOD> Born as a dwarf but abandoned as a baby
<GOOD> Currently we only have Jane showing us a few tricks and this
<GOOD> Monkey money bloons
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> And these people wanna be social workers?
<GOOD> This world is really saddening
<GOOD> I really need to curate my Twitter timeline for a similar reason
<GOOD> I wanna see feesh not people being harassed
<GOOD> Yeah but it's upsetting that they can so easily hide it
<GOOD> I like seeing goth girls because they pretty frfr
<GOOD> Women pretty
<GOOD> If it helps I wouldn't sit next to you on the bus
<GOOD> (I'm nervous around strangers)
<GOOD> I got them mixed up tbh
<GOOD> My card is my money, I thought it was a credit card tho
<GOOD> I've never watched Nostalgia Credit
<GOOD> Critic
<GOOD> I probably should since I like AVGN
<GOOD> I think I'm losing my mind
<GOOD> Why did I make this
<GOOD> Trying to find out what weapon is most fun rn
<GOOD> Ngl bow feels pretty nice
<GOOD> I don't like how heavy weapons feel in this game after trying gunlance
<GOOD> Well I did try aerial gunlance but it wasn't very mobile lmak
<GOOD> Maybe airbow will be more fun
<GOOD> THAT'S WHY IT FELT WEIRD
<GOOD> NO DASH
<GOOD> I make fantastic choices evidently
<GOOD> Oh :((
<GOOD> Why am I always making such ass choices lmao
<GOOD> That sounds kinda fun but is it the nooby weapon
<GOOD> Like is valor greatsword/longsword the choice for random mfs that don't know how to play
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Played it in World
<GOOD> this greatsword kinda saucy
<GOOD> I just like having the step attack option w valor
<GOOD> What does kick and shrug off do
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> No if I press sheath I glow blue
<GOOD> I'll try lance but I may just stick w GS
<GOOD> At least till I learn the game proper
<GOOD> Practicing on small monsters just feels wrong
<GOOD> I'll try it
<GOOD> I don't know how to parry rip
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Can you parry w any shielding weapon?
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Adept lance is cool
<GOOD> Idk whether to play it or not
<GOOD> Also they showed this after the hunt and I found it very funny
<GOOD> I hunta da monsta
<GOOD> Also I got a bunch of DLC items but are any of them useful apart from the raw resources
<GOOD> The quests look hype
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Does the DLC give me any useful armour or weapons or nah
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I got all these fuckin G coins too
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> Also they gave me eggs to sell for a ludicrous amount of money
<GOOD> Also also, wtf are these combo books I bought
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Are there any other weapon/style recommendations for GU
<GOOD> I'm taking any to try except ones I have already
<GOOD> Are they fast?
<GOOD> I used armor orbs from the DLC stuff to upgrade my hunter set lmao
<GOOD> I need a bit of a crutch
<GOOD> I might try sword and shield tbh
<GOOD> I just want a faster option to GS
<GOOD> I'm not like, fighting the controls rn, it's just that I'm dumb and end up in an attack's endlag when I'm getting beat up
<GOOD> AAAAAAAAAAA
<GOOD> Fuming
<GOOD> I will wait for the next sale but oh well
<GOOD> Will splurge for this tho
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I've heard it's ok
<GOOD> I wonder if these have controller support
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> 20th steam anniversary
<GOOD> Which is why I'm pissed that I have no money rn
<GOOD> I'll probably cop the valve collection
<GOOD> I want rain world but can't
<GOOD> God I wish Minecraft wasn't expensive for no reason lmao
<GOOD> Yesh
<GOOD> But I just want java
<GOOD> But I just want Java
<GOOD> Like MC isn't 25 dollars, 2 copies of it are
<GOOD> Valve collection for 8, Terraria for 3
<GOOD> If I had more I'd buy Rain World for 10 but whatever
<GOOD> I already bought Mh this week for 20 so I'm splurging
<GOOD> I'm getting both
<GOOD> 11 isn't beyond my means
<GOOD> I don't know how to mod terraria
<GOOD> Or any game
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I still can't use KB and M tbh
<GOOD> I suck at it
<GOOD> I just wanna use controller
<GOOD> Except a controller is made for playing games
<GOOD> A video game controller is meant to control video games
<GOOD> Yeah but a keyboard isn't made for playing a game on
<GOOD> A keyboard is for typing words
<GOOD> That is a glowy office keyboard
<GOOD> It's not weird to say that a keyboard isn't a gaming controller primarily
<GOOD> It's made to type
<GOOD> It predates video games afaik
<GOOD> Depends on the game
<GOOD> Sure games like civ 6 benefit and shooters benefit
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> Nothing that a controller stick can't do
<GOOD> A mouse is a fine input method
<GOOD> A keyboard isn't made for it really
<GOOD> It's made for inputting text, they had to build the games around the fact that they aren't that ergonomic or helpful as a gaming input method
<GOOD> Like just compare WASD to a left stick for a start
<GOOD> I think that was the first commercial one
<GOOD> I thought Tennis for Two was the first game
<GOOD> They're ok, I prefer when they are single player
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> 2016 and Eternal, yes
<GOOD> I'm genuinely curious what game benefits more from WASD over left stick
<GOOD> What word you spelling with WASD
<GOOD> Wdym Terraria
<GOOD> Terraria benefits most from the mouse
<GOOD> Because you can interact with the UI better
<GOOD> Eternal
<GOOD> >what game benefits MORE from WASD
<GOOD> Also left stick absolutely allows for better movement
<GOOD> Just feels like playing with a d pad
<GOOD> That's... Not what I said?
<GOOD> Oh hey I guess DDR clones could benefit better from keyboard
<GOOD> But tbf their best input method is a plastic mat
<GOOD> In our Master mode world on console I was absolutely cracked with controller
<GOOD> I juked an eye of cthulu phase 2 for like 40 seconds with just a cloud in a bottle while all my friends watched waiting to respawn
<GOOD> Keyboard doesn't have many strong suits, its best purpose is stuff like civ or runescape
<GOOD> Or if you want to say slurs easier in a shooter
<GOOD> Bro there's gonna be nothing left of this company
<GOOD> Mihoyo and TPCI and Nintendo on your ass is the biggest gaming fuck up I've ever seen
<GOOD> It's in my number 1
<GOOD> They aren't even gonna assassinate them, these mfs aren't gonna even have existed in the first place
<GOOD> As I said this is my top 1 gaming fuck up lol
<GOOD> Number 2 is Nintendo not buying Rare
<GOOD> To be fair that was a big fuck up but you genuinely can't beat this Unity thing
<GOOD> I'm not even certain it's legal
<GOOD> It literally affects Unity games that already exist
<GOOD> Dani game dev is dead
<GOOD> I just genuinely can't conceive trying to steal money from Mihoyo and TPCI at the same time, as well as pissing off every indie dev
<GOOD> Ik we call Nintendo brutal but like, over something like this Mihoyo is gonna lynch you
<GOOD> Why do you need an AI to create it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Aaaaa my friend keeps asking to play Terraria on PC but I wanna play GU
<GOOD> I thought a valorant screenshot would be self explanatory
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Sword and Shield is a fun weapon
<GOOD> It feels how I really want the game to feel
<GOOD> Snappy and impactful
<GOOD> I'll probably use Valor GS too tho
<GOOD> Is the cool dive I do part of adept style?
<GOOD> Where I glow blue and jump
<GOOD> I thought this was linking the 2022 one yet again
<GOOD> God SnS is so GOOD
<GOOD> The direct will have a new chibi robo game
<GOOD> I am predicting it, it came to me in a dream
<GOOD> I'm waiting for tomorrow because I had a super annoying issue
<GOOD> The Valve complete collection won't let me buy it because it says the price changed
<GOOD> So I may just buy orange box and portal 2
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Definitely my dad
<GOOD> He tells me the same 3 or so stories over and over
<GOOD> Also meeting w transphobic grandparents rn
<GOOD> Talking about my ftm cousin too rip
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Getting a deal rn
<GOOD> It's 80p
<GOOD> I'm willing to pay for that
<GOOD> Valve randomly deciding to do this the entire day yesterday
<GOOD> It went up by 2 today then let me buy it
<GOOD> Me watching the pressure on all my dials
<GOOD> (They are for my valves)
<GOOD> If you have 2 I'm concerned for you
<GOOD> Learning that the heart valves are just inflating sacs was a weird moment
<GOOD> I find it wilder how other animals do it
<GOOD> Like insects where their insides are just mush and liquids in a pipe
<GOOD> Is it because he does cardio
<GOOD> Nah trust the process
<GOOD> To be fair I don't know how to inject them either
<GOOD> I'm almost certain it goes in the ass
<GOOD> Like the butt cheek
<GOOD> But idk
<GOOD> I'm so close to looking like this but not actually being this
<GOOD> Because I clarify that I'm joking constantly when I genuinely am (not hateful stuff tho)
<GOOD> One of the people I like least on this entire planet used to do that lmao
<GOOD> They talked shit and made fun of me by basically doing a skit with their friend to make me mad then when I clapped back they said I hated them and antagonised me
<GOOD> Because they were just kidding
<GOOD> Like every time I said something they disagreed with:
You seeing this?
Yeah I see this, do you?
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> This Saturday
<GOOD> Not irl but I've seen a different presumably identical room
<GOOD> 5 or 6
<GOOD> Then again it depends on if ppl booked the same floor I did
<GOOD> I haven't met these people yet, I will on Saturday when I move in
<GOOD> Same but tbf as long as they're mildly patient
<GOOD> I don't mind
<GOOD> Because I'm worried about using the kitchen when someone else needs to
<GOOD> The crippling fear of being a mild inconvenience to others
<GOOD> I'm bringing a rice cooker so unless someone else is hooking up different stuff then I should be ok
<GOOD> If they cooking I'll be making rice
<GOOD> No, sorry :/
<GOOD> Bro this rice cooker is gonna carry me
<GOOD> I've even got a plan of cooking rice every monday, Wednesday and Saturday
<GOOD> So the rice keeps to keep me fed the days in-between
<GOOD> Ew no
<GOOD> Probably just making stir fry tbh
<GOOD> Well in the inbetween days
<GOOD> In the days where I make the fresh rice probably just some chicken or smth
<GOOD> I wish I liked it
<GOOD> Fair point
<GOOD> So is chicken and rice
<GOOD> Boxers always
<GOOD> Shiny Palafin is sick
<GOOD> I'm not getting the DLC for a bit
<GOOD> Maybe when wave 2 comes out idk
<GOOD> Depending on how this direct goes I'm not buying it for a loooong time
<GOOD> I somehow did it w randoms first try
<GOOD> Very organised fellas
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I need to stop looking at social media tbh
<GOOD> So much negativity
<GOOD> So many people claiming to be fans of stuff and then every single week hating it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Ladies in suits pretty
<GOOD> That's just a drawing style tho
<GOOD> Just remembered this scene happened
<GOOD> Gushing over yo kai watch rn
<GOOD> Also I am happy to announce the only paper mario I have played is sticker star
<GOOD> Remembering how cool the bosses are
<GOOD> Also should I check out the original mario vs donkey kong
<GOOD> Or is it not worth checking out
<GOOD> In general, I forgot how good the pin mechanic is
<GOOD> Like this is very neat
<GOOD> Or that phantom samurai where you can break his swords to debuff him
<GOOD> 1 yes, I'm only a bit through psychic specters
<GOOD> Imo as a series and speaking objectively YKW is a better and more polished franchise than Pokmon with more heart
<GOOD> I played 1 as a kid, hacked my 3ds and wanted to see how the rest are
<GOOD> Since apparently psychic specters and 3 are even better
<GOOD> Not playing blasters
<GOOD> Or weeble
<GOOD> Also as a kid I wanted march of the minis so badly for like no reason
<GOOD> It was so bizarre
<GOOD> I wanted a mini mario tbh
<GOOD> Why did they never sell them
<GOOD> The entire game is about selling them for money and how everyone wants them
<GOOD> It feels like pepsiman for a product that doesn't exist
<GOOD> Anyway is mario vs DK GBA worth checking out now or nah
<GOOD> Not spending 60 dollars on fucking march of the minis
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I'm just tired
<GOOD> I remember as a kid I beat Orcanos
<GOOD> No idea how I did it because I formulated a genuine strat for it
<GOOD> Yeah I know it is but I thought it was 50 which is 60 dollars
<GOOD> When I get around to playing again yes
<GOOD> I have so many games on my plate
<GOOD> Monster hunter, modded terraria, mario vs dk, the whole N64 and GC libraries, ykw
<GOOD> I already have a bunch of codes lol
<GOOD> I made my team cracked for shits and giggles
<GOOD> I just remember it being a 40 minute brutalising
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> Guard gem robanyan took so many beatings that day
<GOOD> I don't think Pokmon could ever make a fight as stressful as orcanos tbh
<GOOD> Or an event as stressful as ogre time or whatever it's called
<GOOD> Can you kill the killer clown like with orcanos
<GOOD> That's annoying tbh
<GOOD> I liked the unwinnable boss fights of the oni
<GOOD> Where they're so ludicrously broken they dish out and take thousands of hit points
<GOOD> But you can still beat them and you get an easter egg reward
<GOOD> I remember beating Orcanos because it gives you Gleam
<GOOD> Which is a sick as fuck reward
<GOOD> Also bc Wisper is like you weren't even intended to kill that guy in game
<GOOD> WHA
<GOOD> His ass gonna get a beating
<GOOD> Anyway it's 1am I sleep
<GOOD> Oooo exciting
<GOOD> I hope you have fun, you probably will if you relax
<GOOD> I move tomorrow
<GOOD> Doubt is creeping a lil
<GOOD> I know I'm mostly ready
<GOOD> But it doesn't feel like iy
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Damn how could you forget
<GOOD> Naming anything {franchise name} 1 is a terrible idea
<GOOD> Even if it's the first game
<GOOD> I guess
<GOOD> Still for the first entry if you call it 1 then you're just being cocky lmao
<GOOD> Because you're already suggesting there will be a sequel
<GOOD> Because it's bad practice lol
<GOOD> Yeah but it's also not the first game or the first reboot
<GOOD> Are you gonna call the sequel MK 2?
<GOOD> Mario bros 1 isn't a game
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Spidermid frfr
<GOOD> I have themsmell
<GOOD> I'm tired
<GOOD> Yeah but I also have a headache
<GOOD> And my mom keeps walking in and out of my room and leaving the door open for no reason
<GOOD> Like I'm just trying to chill and am constantly just waiting for it
<GOOD> She says she's checking on me but like aaaaa come on
<GOOD> I wake up at 7
<GOOD> And then it's a few hour ride and I can basically move in and shop the rest of today
<GOOD> We wanna get there pretty early so I can food shop and get everything done
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> I do have a window but ID checks specifically are the entire day
<GOOD> I do have some I'd just prefer to have more
<GOOD> Because everything I have is just non perishable
<GOOD> I can't or there won't be time
<GOOD> Also the moving in is spread across multiple days
<GOOD> And multiple windows
<GOOD> We shopped for some stuff but I think I have enough
<GOOD> Plus like I feel too tired to leave bed again I'm so tired oml
<GOOD> Uhhhhhhh Bongos what is your least favourite thing
<GOOD> Based
<GOOD> Favourite media franchise?
<GOOD> I bought this today
<GOOD> SO BASED
<GOOD> Most funny bad show you've ever watched?
<GOOD> Or movie ig
<GOOD> Ah ok I was under the wrong impression since ik you like OP and Pop Team Epic
<GOOD> At least I think you do
<GOOD> Uh I recommend Nichijou for chaotic stuff like Pop Team
<GOOD> counterpoint
<GOOD> Bropper
<GOOD> Female chopper is so adorable
<GOOD> Me making my friend pause One Piece Film Gold so I can show them that Wanze is in the background in a scene
<GOOD> I'm playing Pimin 2 rn after 1 and I still love it
<GOOD> Can't afford 3 and 4 tho
<GOOD> Some are ok
<GOOD> Baron Omatsuri is my favourite but it has body horror for some reason
<GOOD> It's such a bizarre film
<GOOD> World Seeker is not don't buy it
<GOOD> Unless it's dirt cheap
<GOOD> It's not worth more than that
<GOOD> Bro that doesn't matter
<GOOD> The gameplay is like Pirate Warriors
<GOOD> But with single enemies
<GOOD> So you're just beating ass constantly and stun locking until the ludicrous difficulty spike near the end
<GOOD> Basically the endgame is just a bunch of the same very annoying enemy pasted everywhere
<GOOD> There's an encounter where you fight like 12 copies of the final boss lmao
<GOOD> Oh also the DLCs try to be difficult but get to the point where it took me 30 minutes to beat 1 section on the easiest difficulty
<GOOD> Because they put like 20 pacifistas and CP9 agents on a tiny platform
<GOOD> And you have to play as Sabo for that section
<GOOD> Uhh why is your name that
<GOOD> Good
<GOOD> Would you fav or RT
<GOOD> Favourite Pimin colour
<GOOD> (Mine is white or ghost)
<GOOD> Based
<GOOD> Favourite Pimin captain?
<GOOD> I'm team Olimar frfr
<GOOD> Louie ugly
<GOOD> What do you think of my Pimin art
<GOOD> What are your thoughts on Hey Pikmin
<GOOD> Idk anything about it yet
<GOOD> That bad?
<GOOD> Who would win in a fight me or you
<GOOD> Correct
<GOOD> What should I do if I have a headache
<GOOD> Anyway brb eating dinner
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> Can confirm Brum is only good when you go to the china town because then it's awesome
<GOOD> Is it the hocotate freight logo being layered wrong or the hands or issues with the egg colouring
<GOOD> I don't know what that is
<GOOD> It looks fluffy
<GOOD> I love fluffy hair
<GOOD> Ibispaint X
<GOOD> I can't rn
<GOOD> I drew that a while ago and my tablet is packed for uni which is what I draw on
<GOOD> I tried to do that bc the outline was meant to just mark where it ends
<GOOD> This is my WIP art rn
<GOOD> Learning cell shading
<GOOD> That's tomorrow afternoon sorted then
<GOOD> Also  my uni has an Aldi, Lidl, Asda, Morrisons, Iceland and an M&S in an emergency within 10 minutes of it
<GOOD> Farmfoods, Tesco, Waitrose and TK Maxx too
<GOOD> On top of local shops
<GOOD> So hopefully my shopping isn't too painful
<GOOD> I'm not picky
<GOOD> And 50 is my budget
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Idk I can really put food away
<GOOD> Then again bread and meat in any meal fills me up tbh
<GOOD> Hey I can see my house from here
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Tomorrow is about to be busyyy
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Moving into my accommodation rn
<GOOD> Trying my best to socialise
<GOOD> These ppl are nice
<GOOD> First thing I heard them talk about was how they love being called slurs on valorant because they can talk about that person's family situation
<GOOD> They were joking
<GOOD> Guys what should I buy to break the ice w my roommates

<GOOD> I still don't understand jet set
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I thought it was a rhythm game
<GOOD> The dialogue in this game is sending me
<GOOD> Watch out, you're gonna crash, AGH
<GOOD> I didn't turn down the music volume for SA so during the cutscene it was playing over the dialogue lmao
<GOOD> Also Tails' VA is funny af
<GOOD> Why is his audio significantly lower quality than the others
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> Also Chaos is cool
<GOOD> Currently metal sonic is mine
<GOOD> Huh
<GOOD> I didn't know this
<GOOD> Why am I lost already
<GOOD> I went into his workshop and nothing happened
<GOOD> Uh
<GOOD> I beat the boss, but I assumed the orb would vanish if I didn't need it
<GOOD> Am I meant to have gone back to the square
<GOOD> Oh il
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> That windy cave
<GOOD> I didn't know I could pick it up I thought it was a decoration rip
<GOOD> Sonic Adventure 1 is so charming
<GOOD> The models and voice acting are dated but not so dated that it feels bad
<GOOD> It's like watching a b movie
<GOOD> (Idk I drink hot chocolate when I want hot drinks)
<GOOD> It's the delivery and audio quality too
<GOOD> Plus the writing is super cheesy and it works perfectly
<GOOD> Where ya going you big drip?
<GOOD> Tails is so precious in this game
<GOOD> Every line he says
<GOOD> Tails is probably my favourite Sonic character in general tbh
<GOOD> I wish I had any money
<GOOD> Or a place to mail it to
<GOOD> I like Leon ngl
<GOOD> Wait, sinistcha is the evolved form?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> No but I forgot that mon wasn't revealed
<GOOD> Literally radred
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I made a friend today
<GOOD> She likes Nintendo
<GOOD> Omfg my new friend is so cool
<GOOD> She is a big nintendo fan which I didn't expect to meet
<GOOD> Her favourite is splatoon
<GOOD> She likes most of them
<GOOD> I didn't expect to meet people irl that have played fucking Arms lmao
<GOOD> She likes Punch Out and Pikmin also (which I vibe so hard with I love Pikmin)
<GOOD> I will always die on the hill that Arms was just unfortunate because it was a launch title
<GOOD> Actually punch out came up when I was talking about what I want in every direct
<GOOD> F Zero 99 is so funny lmao
<GOOD> I haven't played yet cuz no LAN cable, but the reveal was so funny
<GOOD> Ooooo
<GOOD> I think that it suffered from being a new franchise when other flagship titles were releasing
<GOOD> Yeah, but it wasn't Splatoon, which I assume Nintendo wanted
<GOOD> BotW and MK8 is already enough
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> But 1-2 Switch has more appeal imo
<GOOD> It's a buy it to appease children game
<GOOD> Or to play with old people
<GOOD> Like Wii sports ig
<GOOD> You know the sort of game
<GOOD> Where Nintendo shows the white suburban family in the living room during the ads for it
<GOOD> Think Just Dance
<GOOD> Every Amiibo advert
<GOOD> DK says this is gonna be bananas with the deadpan delivery lives in my head
<GOOD> Ok tbf that game is actually pretty cool
<GOOD> I don't mind this remake
<GOOD> I know this sounds dumb but I like that no one asked for this
<GOOD> Keyword asked
<GOOD> People wanted SMRPG and TTYD remakes
<GOOD> They just didn't think it would happen
<GOOD> I wanted to try colour splash and origami king ngl
<GOOD> I wanna make a Pikmin shrine
<GOOD> I just lost like 50 pikmin in 1 floor
<GOOD> I'm ass at these boss battles
<GOOD> Man at legs
<GOOD> What about cannon
<GOOD> Yeah I got it
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I lost the pikmin but he died
<GOOD> I have also had the displeasure of meeting gatling groinks
<GOOD> I don't know how to beat them
<GOOD> They always sit on precarious areas and shake my pikmin off into the void
<GOOD> What, throw stuff onto their ass?
<GOOD> Also I'm screaming rn because they said I didn't need white pikmin and there's a treasure I need white pikmin to dig up
<GOOD> So I have to run this entire thing again
<GOOD> Wish I knew that beforehand
<GOOD> Yeah but why not just say before whether you'll need them or not
<GOOD> Instead of having my time wasted
<GOOD> Like they should actually advertise what I need and not force me to figure it out bruh
<GOOD> Yippee 90% of debt cleared
<GOOD> Wha
<GOOD> Oh great
<GOOD> I think I'll do Shower Room next
<GOOD> But it requires all 4 elements so I'm worried
<GOOD> The only ones I haven't done are the 2 in perplexing pool that aren't the citadel of spiders, and the final one in the crash site area
<GOOD> Idk it's the one right at the end of the map
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Nvm I checked it's Frontier Cavern
<GOOD> I've done everything in Awakening wood
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Actually I may try Glutton's Kitchen
<GOOD> Doesn't seem too bad and only needs yellows
<GOOD> I prefer 2
<GOOD> Ok so like I paid off the debt super early lmao
<GOOD> And now the credits are rolling
<GOOD> Pikmin 2's plot is literally paying off debt
<GOOD> What does challenge mode add btw
<GOOD> And what is wistful wilds it doesn't sound wistful
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> I haven't done the rest yet lmao
<GOOD> It's a deathless challenge?
<GOOD> I can't do anything deathless lmao
<GOOD> I'll do the others first then
<GOOD> 20 I think
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I didn't know Pikmin had e reader compatibility
<GOOD> Omg
<GOOD> I love Pimin
<GOOD> Ooooo what a lovely dungeon name
<GOOD> (Clueless)
<GOOD> I just finished it, I was busy so I didn't post the image
<GOOD> I took like 70 in
<GOOD> 30 came back
<GOOD> Oh also it was terrifying
<GOOD> 2nd floor was scary, the rest was actually ok
<GOOD> But still scary
<GOOD> This thing
<GOOD> Yeah it's good af
<GOOD> I've done everything except Wistful Wilds
<GOOD> And I'm landing on day 31 so I'll try and find those bugs
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Also I think Submerged Castle is my favourite dungeon
<GOOD> Cave
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> I hate Gatling Groink so much
<GOOD> Also I did actually spend 1 day in Wistful Wild but basically nothing happened
<GOOD> I broke down a gate and killed a few enemies
<GOOD> Also discovered Chaos Cavern or whatever
<GOOD> Which I am not going down yet
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Idk if I'll make it
<GOOD> I broke down that path on the bottom tho so maybe
<GOOD> I ran away from the final boss of Pimin 2 x_x
<GOOD> It was a tough decision
<GOOD> But probably the correct one
<GOOD> Oh then my friend was just being an asshole
<GOOD> So I assume water, fire, poison then electric?
<GOOD> Mario is Missing is also canon so like our irl planet is canon to Mario
<GOOD> I think NSMB2 is pretty ass
<GOOD> 880 unique ones
<GOOD> Mario 2 is good tbh
<GOOD> Wii is probably my favourite
<GOOD> Reminds me of that Mario and Sonic Winter Olympics game where there's just boss fights
<GOOD> Wo-hoah guys, what WERE they thinking putting Peach in DIFFERENT clothing
<GOOD> I fuckin hate it when any Mario media releases and Twitter is like *wink wink* *nudge nudge* omg guys, Nintendo REALLY weren't thinking when they made this one!
<GOOD> And it's just a regular ass screenshot or character design
<GOOD> This is exactly what I mean
<GOOD> Guys the designer KNEW what he was doing making a female Nintendo character do anything!!!!
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> And he was a tanuki before that sp
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Now that one was just dumb
<GOOD> I meant stuff like overreaction to the elephant powerup by react tubers
<GOOD> HA
<GOOD> I KNEW IT
<GOOD> Oh em gee I won't open twitter ever again
<GOOD> Women in 2023 can't platform, all they know is side game, eat elephant flower and lie
<GOOD> Wowie Zowie is hilarious tho
<GOOD> It would be funny to hear them try
<GOOD> Also Vill, Dream Den and Hole of Heroes were hell
<GOOD> I am so fucking lucky that Raging Long Legs is a dogshit boss
<GOOD> Huh
<GOOD> I was talking about Hole of Heroes
<GOOD> I did the last 3 floors with like 4 pikmin per boss
<GOOD> I wish I had a gf
<GOOD> I think I'll wait till tomorrow to finish Pik 2
<GOOD> Man at legs
<GOOD> Although his refight was very easy
<GOOD> I didn't lose a single pikmin in the Hole of Heroes rematch
<GOOD> In Dream Den I was so pissed off at it I punched it to death with my bare hands
<GOOD> I hate Gatling Groink sm
<GOOD> Oh and that floor where there's a Gatling Groink that REQUIRES you bring a bunch of Yellow Pikmin up a tower to get it
<GOOD> I'll have to go back so I can fight Titan Dweevil, but I've got every other treasure so
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I did that yesterday
<GOOD> I have some in my cupboard but idk where to use it
<GOOD> Yeah but when
<GOOD> Like if I'm boiling rice can I just sprinkle it in during cooking?
<GOOD> I was literally just using it
<GOOD> I made too much rice
<GOOD> Apparently 4 cups is a lot more than it seems
<GOOD> Oki time for my final run through dream den
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> which one is the water weapon
<GOOD> I can't tell
<GOOD> Oo
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I took off the launcher
<GOOD> What's the next weapon, the flamethrower?
<GOOD> Forget it I'm just going comedy bomb
<GOOD> Then flamethrower
<GOOD> All the pieces are gone
<GOOD> Imma just take them to the ship while he walks around like a dumbass
<GOOD> So why do people hate Louie so violently lmao
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Guess it's time for challenge mode then
<GOOD> Does it just have to be finished or is there a special thing I have to do
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> What decides it
<GOOD> This is gonna be so annoying
<GOOD> I don't own 3 or 4
<GOOD> Oh my goooodddddd
<GOOD> I don't like challenge mode
<GOOD> I lost 2 whole pikmin which ig means I didn't get the fucking thing
<GOOD> Great
<GOOD> I literally got 150 points different in one level and it was perfect
<GOOD> Which is about the equivalent of one pikmin
<GOOD> Bro this game doesn't know what it's doing
<GOOD> No u
<GOOD> And failed w the higher score
<GOOD> Ugh it sucks
<GOOD> It is super inconsistent in how strict it is
<GOOD> I hate ranking systems
<GOOD> Idk that mode just gave me immediate burnout
<GOOD> I added a sprinkle of MSG to microwave reheated rice
<GOOD> It's so nice
<GOOD> Birmingham moment
<GOOD> Oh boy I like feeling like shit on a Saturday night
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I need to 100% the Pimin 2 challenge mode tomorrow (provided I'm not doing anything (I probably won't I'm super fucking lonely))
<GOOD> I have a new friend and she said if she was feeling up to it we could go to a club, and she just hasn't responded at all so
<GOOD> That's great
<GOOD> I have no idea how to do one of them so far so that's great
<GOOD> Let alone getting a perfect rank
<GOOD> I can't tell whether I'm anticipating or worried for therapy
<GOOD> Imagine
<GOOD> I don't really wanna talk about that today if that's alr
<GOOD> Np
<GOOD> Just uh, not the greatest day
<GOOD> I haven't really talked to anyone and a friend made plans then just went offline and hasn't responded
<GOOD> Sorry if that sounds dickish at all
<GOOD> Aaaaa my brain
<GOOD> I hate brain
<GOOD> A new friend didn't respond for a day or so on whether she was going to a party (basically she said she would say and wanted me to tag along) and it's like ooooo she hates you stop messaging them
<GOOD> Which tbf I have because I've sent messages like every 4 hours or so to them which is x_x
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> But my brain isn't reasonable
<GOOD> Me probably
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> It's just self doubt
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> But tbf this happens with many new friends ~~which is probably why I don't have many~~
<GOOD> They were like oh I don't mind at all message anytime
<GOOD> Which I always interpret as a mixed message and that they're just being polite
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> She probably just forgot or smth
<GOOD> Yeah ik
<GOOD> I already said but I don't think that, my brain does
<GOOD> I really fucking hope I can get the help I need tbh, if therapy doesn't work out idk what to really do
<GOOD> That feels worse
<GOOD> No bc I'd send multiple voice messages
<GOOD> Like remembering shit I gotta say
<GOOD> Not a promise that can be kept
<GOOD> I'm optimistic but like
<GOOD> Sometimes it doesn't work out
<GOOD> >I'm optimistic
<GOOD> Certainty is just silly
<GOOD> Can't be sure anything is gonna happen
<GOOD> Whatever I'm gonna shut up
<GOOD> Arguing about random pointless stuff isn't gonna help
<GOOD> I meant more confrontational about what doesn't matter
<GOOD> I'm certain you'll get better at therapy
Uh nuh uh actually you can't be
<GOOD> Like man I gotta shut my ass up
<GOOD> Also I'm so confused
<GOOD> What does a character being ___-coded mean
<GOOD> No it's like, a term used on Twitter and I just don't get it
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> What gay traits does Scar have lmao
<GOOD> It's not second guessing it's just me picking arguments over genuine sentiment
<GOOD> I wouldn't say effeminate but being dramatic is just like... idk
<GOOD> I don't see it
<GOOD> He's slinky because he's a sly character
<GOOD> I can see that a bit more
<GOOD> But Scar just doesn't hit it, being over the top doesn't make you queer coded to me
<GOOD> Ok I have to know about this one
<GOOD> Is my sensor for this thing broken or is Jafar just too one dimensional as a person to be anything coded
<GOOD> Like Jafar as far as movie villains go, has like no personality
<GOOD> But isn't the slinky movement just a way of signifying a more deceptive character
<GOOD> Like these 3 characters are all characters that lied and deceived the protagonist
<GOOD> And are hatching master plans
<GOOD> I mean that's just a villain archetype
<GOOD> Sneaky and smart, or simple and big and loud and menacing
<GOOD> There's levels but like that's a lot of villains
<GOOD> I can sorta get that, but I feel like I'm missing something
<GOOD> They made all the queer coded characters villains, what did they mean by this  /j
<GOOD> Jafar doesn't
<GOOD> He gets sealed away forever
<GOOD> Until the sequel I've never seen
<GOOD> I mean Scar and Ursula die pretty badly
<GOOD> Imo Dr Facilier has the best villain death scene from Disney
<GOOD> I can see that one
<GOOD> I usually remember the people the film is named after
<GOOD> Dr Facilier is from princess and the frog
<GOOD> ARE YOU REAAAAA-DY!?
<GOOD> Same dyse
<GOOD> Dude
<GOOD> This reminds me of those stupid memes
<GOOD> All the images look like that dog
<GOOD> I saw this
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Therapy was weirf
<GOOD> Weird
<GOOD> I did the therapy wahoo
<GOOD> It went
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I overshared to someone I only knew for like 20 minutes
<GOOD> And I couldn't articulate some things so
<GOOD> Idk it just felt messy
<GOOD> They scheduled another one same time next month
<GOOD> We didn't really get around to my anger issues
<GOOD> Just stress and self worth for now
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I have a cool assignment
<GOOD> I have to look at a marine bio thing that interests me, then look at a scientific paper on it, *then* find smth I don't understand in that paper and make notes on that instead
<GOOD> Currently looking at how octopi punch fish
<GOOD> Wasn't this the post that called out guys look bloodborne fans are doing this
<GOOD> And no one is actually doing it
<GOOD> THERE'S NO WAY
<GOOD> They made him a blend of Melee Fox and Falco I'm crying
<GOOD> It's Garfield
<GOOD> Garfield becoming Melee Fox with Monado is hilarious
<GOOD> They also added The Knee
<GOOD> She's from Hey Arnold
<GOOD> Also they made Nigel Thornberry into Jigglypuff
<GOOD> Cartoon
<GOOD> Oh Ren and Stimpy are partly Wario
<GOOD> I mean that's why I said partly
<GOOD> I.e Ren and Stimpy's down special isn't just a fart, it's a counter
<GOOD> The counter builds a meter and that meter can be used to confirm waft
<GOOD> The biggest reason I'm comparing the characters is because in general, no platform fighter can escape being compared to some Smash character's attacks
<GOOD> There's like 60 SSB characters total if we include old movesets or just how the characters are
<GOOD> I mean since the last game they completely revamped everything
<GOOD> Idk what you want em to do
<GOOD> It has a visual overhaul, more customisable stuff, updated movesets for most if not all returning characters
<GOOD> They revamped it to be better
<GOOD> Doesn't make it bad either
<GOOD> The visual overhaul is fantastic looking, the roster additions are sick, the movesets themselves feel and look more fluid and well thought out this time
<GOOD> Do you forget that every platform fighter in existence has obscure picks or
<GOOD> Like, fucking Smash Bros has Captain Falcon and Mr Game and Watch
<GOOD> On top of so many other mfs that shouldn't be there but are now fan favourites
<GOOD> But then why complain about a game having an obscure character pick
<GOOD> He wasn't even a character before he was added to SSB as far as I know
<GOOD> Me when I lie
<GOOD> There genuinely isn't anything more they can do to this game as a sequel, it's literally just hey what if this one was better in every conceivable fashion
<GOOD> This game is dogshit, why didn't they fix it?
Game dev fixes it
Why did they even make this, the first one was so bad!
<GOOD> I mean, basically every moveset is inspired by the actual series they're from, more than I can say for Smash
<GOOD> They literally have Hungrybox here breaking down how the movement is fixed in this game
<GOOD> So you didn't bother watching it
<GOOD> And instead just suggested he got paid off
<GOOD> So why bother then if you're just gonna blindly shit on a genuine attempt to fix a game
<GOOD> Like they essentially made a different game from the ground up with the same basic concept
<GOOD> So why do you care about shitting on it if you aren't gonna attempt to absorb anything about it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Also this meter mechanic is fun
<GOOD> Why should I attempt to understand something I disagree with? I should just immediately dislike it
<GOOD> That this game is entirely different to what the original game was, they took the concept and are advertising literally everything they changed and fixed about it, from how everything controls to how the characters play to game mechanics and are attempting to convey our bad, that game had a lot of fixing to do and then they did exactly that
<GOOD> They could have easily left all star brawl as a dead game but they decided to try and redeem it in the best way possible
<GOOD> By *actually fixing the damn problems*
<GOOD> The thing is this isn't like, a patch or smth
<GOOD> This is literally taking out the concept and characters and changing everything about it
<GOOD> If they really just cared about money they could have just dropped it and took what they got from an ass game
<GOOD> I mean that's exactly how you fill out a platform fighter roster
<GOOD> RoA is the only one that didn't and it's solid, but its biggest draw is the modding
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> If you watched any of the videos I sent that would probably have been obvious
<GOOD> But you decided not to in favour of just hating it
<GOOD> I mean you didn't even know what game you were talking about
<GOOD> No battle pass
<GOOD> No dogshit mechanics that lead to 0 to deaths
<GOOD> Their advertisements are actually targeting both casual players and the FGC
<GOOD> I mean I can't exactly take your sarcasm seriously when you got the game wrong and actively chose to not consume any of the media you decided to actively despise
<GOOD> I played All Star Brawl, it was utter shit and I say that even after getting it free
<GOOD> It's not even like I have a bias towards Nick because I don't have an attachment to any character
<GOOD> Except spongebob ig
<GOOD> Nest ball kinda works
<GOOD> Or safari ball
<GOOD> Just made the worst introduction PowerPoint ever
<GOOD> I gotta present it in a sec
<GOOD> It's very band kid
<GOOD> Admitting to the class I like Pikmin is a bold move
<GOOD> I did too but now I have a cool uni friend that likes it too
<GOOD> Idk why but some Nintendo games do just give me raw joy
<GOOD> (Unless it's Pikmin that one makes me feel a huge range of emotions the Water Wraith is probably one of the most frightening experiences I've had in gaming)
<GOOD> The whistling noise that accompanies this sends me into such a panic
<GOOD> Idk it's not fear, it's dread
<GOOD> Me watching all my pikmin get hit by a withering blowhog behind a gate they were destroying
<GOOD> I beat it
<GOOD> I tried to do the challenge mode perfect but some maps are just frustrating
<GOOD> I may go back to them but idk
<GOOD> Now am just waiting to buy Pimin 3 or 4
<GOOD> Maybe 4 idk
<GOOD> I don't know which I want first cuz 4 looks fun af
<GOOD> I still can't believe it
<GOOD> Also I think Ren and Stimpy will be broken, they have Wario bike and waft, and they also have Gordo
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's his neutral special
<GOOD> No, his neutral special specifically looks like that
<GOOD> Yeah they do that in all of them
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> They got Hungrybox to do like a 6 minute video on how they changed movement
<GOOD> Not immediately no
<GOOD> It looks promising tho
<GOOD> It's her Super for some reason
<GOOD> Also Squidward has the bicycle lmao
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> Squidward's F Smash is the pizza thing
<GOOD> Ah hell nah
<GOOD> Squidward got the janky ass hitbox
<GOOD> Me when I'm wrong fr
<GOOD> Yeah but his entire kit is taken from one off shit
<GOOD> His up smash is krakatoa
<GOOD> Plankton's moveset is cool
<GOOD> Yeah the meter system from more traditional fighters works better
<GOOD> Attack cancelling adds a layer of skill
<GOOD> Also Patrick has the house smash thing
<GOOD> Also Plankton can reduce DI with one of his specials
<GOOD> That's insanely good
<GOOD> I mean the meter itself is costly, final smashes are basically the same and expending meter to cancel abilities is cool
<GOOD> Plus using them to power up existing abilities
<GOOD> I might main Ren and Stimpy tbh
<GOOD> The Super makes Ren the president
<GOOD> What do you mean you don't agree with me, I'm the president!
<GOOD> Garfiel is awesome
<GOOD> His new kit looks fun
<GOOD> But ren and stimpy are literally Wario and Dedede fused together so
<GOOD> They gave Gertie The Knee
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> Oh also April O Neal has sweet spots on her microphone
<GOOD> Donny feels like a classic swordfighter
<GOOD> El Tigre has some moves from Wolf
<GOOD> Doesn't really matter for this roster
<GOOD> Air bender is sick
<GOOD> I need to watch more ren and stimpy
<GOOD> Did you see the Dreams project
<GOOD> I hope that Korra and Danny Phantom aren't as annoying as last time
<GOOD> I love this image so much
<GOOD> Also bro I'm mandated to do math classes in my foundation year
<GOOD> I'm doing fucking BIDMAS rn
<GOOD> Uh is it called PEMDAS elsewhere
<GOOD> I just call it BIDMAS
<GOOD> Because Brackets Indices Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction
<GOOD> Makes more sense to me
<GOOD> Meat is yummy
<GOOD> Also watch out fellas we've moved up a level
<GOOD> (If one of these is wrong I'm dying)
<GOOD> False meat is mid
<GOOD> Although mycoproteins are fascinating
<GOOD> I think they're the future of some food
<GOOD> Also how much do you have to say in a 5 minute podcast
<GOOD> Ik this is specific but one of my assignments is to record a 5 minute podcast
<GOOD> Dandori failure
<GOOD> I'm saving up for Pimin 4 now
<GOOD> I made a bunch of simple maths mistakes
<GOOD> Pissed me off
<GOOD> I'm so stupid bro
<GOOD> I haven't done them for 3 years
<GOOD> I feel so dumb
<GOOD> I'm failing at basic maths rn it's so annoying
<GOOD> I'm dumb
<GOOD> Yeah but I'm 18 I already passed math AAAAGH
<GOOD> Ughhhh I'm actually struggling on normal fractions
<GOOD> I hate this
<GOOD> But it's literally shit I already knew
<GOOD> I shouldn't be getting them wrong or finding them difficult
<GOOD> 2 years ago
<GOOD> Or 3
<GOOD> Mental math is not a skill that should immediately degrade
<GOOD> I thought 5x7 was 45 just now
<GOOD> I had to correct myself
<GOOD> I love these sorts of images
<GOOD> Yeah but like it hasn't been that long
<GOOD> I got a crazy amount of random multiplication wrong
<GOOD> I found the website ppl use for it
<GOOD> Nah I prefer funny looking things
<GOOD> Well that's what I was linked to
<GOOD> I invited my friends to mini golf once and they all ignored me completely
<GOOD> It was for my birthday
<GOOD> Thanks but I think my interests and stuff I find fun is just too childish
<GOOD> Bro alllll my interests make me embarrassed to talk about
<GOOD> Hey guys I like anime and Nintendo games and D&D and cartoons!!!!!
<GOOD> Idk even as an adult now I'm still embarrassed saying I like some things
<GOOD> Because it just feels like I'm pushing myself away from such a large majority of people by saying I like these things, even if they have a large audience
<GOOD> Like by some miracle I've met 3 fucking pikmin fans in 1 week
<GOOD> How tf did that happen
<GOOD> I didn't tell them that until I already knew them
<GOOD> I mentioned I liked D&D and half my flatmates were immediately interested or had already played
<GOOD> Which is like 4 people
<GOOD> Keeping in mind, these 3 people are the ONLY people I'm friends with outside of my flat
<GOOD> And they were all pikmin fans
<GOOD> Because it still feels weird to say I like anime and Nintendo is cool
<GOOD> Like am I just overthinking the high school mentality or what
<GOOD> This reminds me I need to ask my flatmate if I can borrow Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze
<GOOD> My new friend is a Demon Slayer and CSM fan
<GOOD> Imo Nintendo is the best of the companies we got, they always innovate
<GOOD> Every console is what the fuck but in a good way
<GOOD> Except the Wii U
<GOOD> That one was what the fuck in the bad way
<GOOD> And the Virtual Boy
<GOOD> But yk the rest is fine
<GOOD> That's what I mean though, they're always the innovator
<GOOD> That happened w Wii as well
<GOOD> Never been their market, never will be
<GOOD> Nintendo has ALWAYS made budget consoles
<GOOD> And Nintendo is passable as always
<GOOD> I feel like the Kinect missed that point
<GOOD> Not what innovation means
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> If Nintendo makes expensive consoles, families won't buy it for children and themselves
<GOOD> Simple as
<GOOD> By being the budget option Nintendo absolutely obliterates competition when it comes to kids
<GOOD> It's their strategy
<GOOD> The GameCube was not powerful
<GOOD> The PS2 was already out by the Gamecube
<GOOD> Like a year before
<GOOD> Ok but like lower class families still won't be able to have that, and young children are still young children
<GOOD> Nintendo makes more digestible and strange games that appeal to all age ranges
<GOOD> Yeah but like there's still a market that PS and Xbox can't muscle in on at all, simply because of how ridiculously strong the marketability of Nintendo's mascots are
<GOOD> Like, PlayStation's mascot is that fucking Astro robot
<GOOD> And Xbox doesn't really have one
<GOOD> Yeah I forgor about that
<GOOD> They fumbled the bag w that which is why the GC didn't sell too great
<GOOD> Wii U was *comparatively* powerful
<GOOD> And look how the GC turned out
<GOOD> The PS3 was still the latest PS at the time, even if outdated
<GOOD> It's almost like making a portable PS4 is incredibly fucking expensive or inefficient or smth
<GOOD> WETHERSPOONS RAAAAAAGH
<GOOD> I mean that's Nintendo's thing
<GOOD> They literally just benefit far far far far more from making an underpowered console
<GOOD> Ok great idc
<GOOD> I was comparing the Wii U to other nintendo consoles
<GOOD> Comparatively it was a massive fucking jump
<GOOD> Also the Wii U flopped for basically every reason since it was invented
<GOOD> Not really since you decided to make nonsense statements like innovate better hardware
<GOOD> Instead of just listening to the point
<GOOD> It's still a nonsense statement
<GOOD> Then stop waffling about shit for no reason
<GOOD> And then I explained it and you just decided to ignore that so
<GOOD> Immediately after you completely ignored what I was saying
<GOOD> So there's no real point in talking to you about it
<GOOD> Haha I don't care about what you said I'm gonna say the same dismissive thing I was already saying
<GOOD> Innovate better hardware haha
Well the reason they do that is-
Innovate better hardware haha
That makes no sense
I don't care innovate better hardware haha
<GOOD> Do you see how this is annoying
<GOOD> Like it wasn't funny the first time, I'm trying to have a conversation with you
<GOOD> There wasn't a discussion until you stopped saying it constantly
<GOOD> Whatever, lesson learned
<GOOD> You were taking it as a joke
<GOOD> But doesn't matter because I guess it's not worth
<GOOD> I'm tired again
<GOOD> I don't wanna eep
<GOOD> Oh my therapist responded
<GOOD> Guess I have some work to do tonight
<GOOD> Oh dear there's so much work here
<GOOD> My therapist sent a lot
<GOOD> I failed basic fraction operations because of a stupid mistake wahoo
<GOOD> It was just multiplying
<GOOD> What the fuck
<GOOD> FUUUUUCK I MADE TOO MUCH
<GOOD> I'm ngl I had a full day today and much less the rest of the week so I may just scran this
<GOOD> I usually do that
<GOOD> Oh I already ate what was w it
<GOOD> Presentation is everything
<GOOD> I bought this from Morrisons for so cheap
<GOOD> I mean that's not really too organised I just cut it and put it there
<GOOD> One day I wanna cover the rim of the bowl w super thinly sliced cucumber
<GOOD> And just have the chicken in the middle like an island fr
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> And can't think of what sauce to put on
<GOOD> Oh no, that's jus chicken
<GOOD> I wish it was pork tho that sounds sick
<GOOD> Wh
<GOOD> I've never heard of that
<GOOD> I need to try oyster sauce on my rice
<GOOD> Yeah I just didn't buy any
<GOOD> Pimin is officially my favourite game franchise and I'm only halfway through
<GOOD> I actually wanna play it
<GOOD> I hate having to constantly block transphobic engagement farmers on Twitter I just want Pimin and feesh
<GOOD> I like them
<GOOD> They're ok
<GOOD> Rosie
<GOOD> Look how much longer it takes to pick Wario
<GOOD> Aaaaa durability
<GOOD> I need a sword n shield w green durability but this moofah one is ass
<GOOD> What the fuck is bubblefoam
<GOOD> I just hunted Khezu
<GOOD> I am never hunting Khezu again
<GOOD> Actually the worst hunt I've ever done
<GOOD> I am never hunting this monster again.
<GOOD> I love sea of thieves
<GOOD> I played it w my dad until my dad made it super unfun to play with him
<GOOD> Yk that one episode of Spongebob where Mr. Krabs follows him home and pesters him through the entire day and night to play the stupid fucking pirate game
<GOOD> That's what my dad did
<GOOD> Plus like when we played it, we *only* did quests, no chilling
<GOOD> Adventure
<GOOD> Or tutorial ig
<GOOD> If you don't know how to play
<GOOD> You get a snazzy sail
<GOOD> Also mfs are acting like solo servers are gonna ruin the entire game
<GOOD> Like bro, if you don't like it don't use it
<GOOD> Apparently yeah
<GOOD> Idk if you can invite friends tho they didn't say
<GOOD> Greatly reduced rewards too
<GOOD> I think it's to make actual online stuff not completely a hostile place
<GOOD> Because there is still a risk/reward
<GOOD> I ranted to my friend about how much I hate Khezu and he sent me this
<GOOD> I have also been informed I must fight Khezu again at some point
<GOOD> Kill me
<GOOD> Actually the worst monster I've ever fought thus far
<GOOD> I don't want to
<GOOD> Can it go away
<GOOD> It's such a bullshit fight
<GOOD> If you're sick after eating the earthworms, take out the bucket
<GOOD> Ughhhh
<GOOD> I'm still not fighting it
<GOOD> MHGU
<GOOD> What style is most fun for them
<GOOD> Man why don't Pikmin have any special edition consoles
<GOOD> Custom or otherwise
<GOOD> Would kill for a Pimin GBA
<GOOD> There are many custom shells but I can't find Pimin ones
<GOOD> Probably because there's only one way to play Pikmin on GBA and it's both region locked and e reader exclusive
<GOOD> Also, there's a gaming club at my uni so I'm gonna sign up
<GOOD> They have a gaming marathon planned mid November and I'm gonna hopefully have all Pikmin games by then and play every single one in a marathon
<GOOD> It's for 48 hours lmaoooo
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's just annoying that Pimin gets no love in terms of products
<GOOD> If there were a Pimin Gamecube I would scoop it up without hesitation
<GOOD> It's interesting that this exists at all tbh
<GOOD> If they had made a full spinoff title of this I would play it def
<GOOD> Joined the club
<GOOD> Now hopefully I will meet at least some ppl there
<GOOD> Thank you youtube subtitles
<GOOD> Tired x_x I woke up bc of nightmares
<GOOD> Huh
<GOOD> Uh uh
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> I finally connected my 3DS and Switch to the uni wifi
<GOOD> So rn I'm pirating hey pikmin over uni wifi
<GOOD> My self help book my therapist sent just explained the difference between facts and opinions, and their example of an opinion is apparently There is nothing wrong with combining drugs and alcohol
<GOOD> Every other example was entirely mundane, wtf is this
<GOOD> Downloading MH4U
<GOOD> Maybe 3U as well
<GOOD> THAT'S SO COOL
<GOOD> I want oneeee to cuddle
<GOOD> This reminds me of the time my dad yelled at 2 cats to stop fighting in our garden and one tried walking up the stairs into our flat immediately after
<GOOD> Omg guys the therapy book knows my morning affirmations!!!
<GOOD> (This book is lowkey super helpful)
<GOOD> Pathfinder fans trying their hardest to not tell D&D fans to play Pathfinder (idk anything about it but I'm sure it's good)
<GOOD> Oh well, The Mouse owns all
<GOOD> Ursula isn't the villain I like
<GOOD> *a villain
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> I don't find Disney characters hot
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I'm not suprised it just isn't my thing
<GOOD> Also I should play Banjo Kazooie tbh
<GOOD> I've heard it's good
<GOOD> I've never properly played it
<GOOD> And I saw someone draw this today which made me remember I adore their design
<GOOD> Wish I had them in Smash
<GOOD> Oswald is still the most adorable fella Disney has made
<GOOD> Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favourite movies to watch so agreed
<GOOD> Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Lilo and Stitch are probably my favourite movies but don't tell anyone because it makes me weird
<GOOD> (I don't care that it's dated Who Framed Roger Rabbit is awesome)
<GOOD> A 50s detective espionage with cartoon characters in the real world is just such a cool concept to me
<GOOD> Jingle All the Way is so ridiculous I love it
<GOOD> Sniffa
<GOOD> I don't really have any morals when it comes to funding big corporations
<GOOD> If the thing I'm getting is what I want I'm indifferent as to it because the company isn't gonna be boycotted by me not getting something I want
<GOOD> A LOT of the jokes still get a laugh from me
<GOOD> I think the time it gets dated is with judge doom tho
<GOOD> I love the part with the Weasel Patrol invading the house and he gets dunked in the water
<GOOD> Or the shave and a haircut scene
<GOOD> Ooo a cat?
<GOOD> Anyway gn all
<GOOD> one {cursedcat}
<GOOD> Guys I'm so funny
<GOOD> Remember twenny one
<GOOD> Bro
<GOOD> It's so well drawn
<GOOD> I wanna play Banjo in Smash
<GOOD> My friend is helping me rank up in GU multiplayer
<GOOD> My friend is HR 120 so I'm worried about making mistakes in front of them lmao
<GOOD> They've nerfed themselves as much as possible so the hunt doesn't immediately end tho
<GOOD> We just hunted a Nargacuga who looks cool
<GOOD> But I'm a tiny bit tired of every other enemy being Yian Kut Ku
<GOOD> Iceborne maybe
<GOOD> I've fought 3 monsters now that either resemble its body type and attacks exactly or just are Yian Kut Ku
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah those 3
<GOOD> Of like 10 multiplayer hunts I've done 4 of them have been those
<GOOD> Khezu is not Yian Kut Ku
<GOOD> It has no similar attacks really
<GOOD> Being a wyvern doesn't make you a clone, having basically every attack be identical does
<GOOD> Oh right, the spin
<GOOD> Yeah which I'd say is different enough
<GOOD> But I'm not defending Khezu it's the worst monster I've ever fought so
<GOOD> I ranted to my friend for like 10 minutes about how much I hate Khezu and he sent me this when I was finished
<GOOD> I like Lagombi tho what a silly billy
<GOOD> He carted me once less than 30 seconds from killing him and I almost threw my controller because of how much the fight was frustrating me
<GOOD> The lesson is go fuck yourself
<GOOD> It's such a boring hunt
<GOOD> Not really, the lesson is that you should wait for like a billion years for a window to get in 3 attacks
<GOOD> I mean Khezu in general is just
<GOOD> Super fucking annoying
<GOOD> Its attacks are just frustrating
<GOOD> The only lesson I learned was to not fight Khezu and that it was gonna take forever
<GOOD> Aerial hammer
<GOOD> You can, *maybe*, if you already knew it was coming because the windup is slow
<GOOD> The only other option is constantly sticking to him and using i frames on the jump, which doesn't work because he always does the attack twice
<GOOD> The basic X attack of the hammer
<GOOD> No, because why would I be doing that if it's sapping my stamina and I'm using aerial
<GOOD> Especially since Khezu's attacks come out fast enough to just knock you out of charge
<GOOD> Until it just does another disjointed attack
<GOOD> Like if it was gonna do the AoE but it spins instead then like
<GOOD> Not if I'm charging
<GOOD> If I'm sticking to the head I will not be able to, since the spin comes out crazy fast
<GOOD> Anyway Khezu sucks ass
<GOOD> Worst monster
<GOOD> That was a fine hunt
<GOOD> Khezu is just ass
<GOOD> Roar-->electricity-->roar-->tail spin-->tail spin-->roar
<GOOD> The electricity is obnoxious as hell because of the frequency it uses it
<GOOD> It's a time waster
<GOOD> I don't use ranged weapons
<GOOD> I can't hit it during it if it's just gonna shock anyway
<GOOD> Just hit it bro it isn't that hard Khezu is a fun monster I promise
<GOOD> I didn't change my approach tbh it just took longer
<GOOD> Because it was wasting time
<GOOD> Every time I would approach it would shock or spin, hitting me to the ground and wasting more time
<GOOD> Or if I did the aerial leap it would just shock
<GOOD> Khezu just does the dive attack or the ranged attacks at range
<GOOD> It lets you get close for free
<GOOD> You're still approaching it
<GOOD> The thing is the windup for that window is so long
<GOOD> Like am I just meant to hold charge and drain all my Stamina waiting for it to do something not stupid
<GOOD> So the opposite of what Bounty said
<GOOD> Which is what I was already doing because charge is ass
<GOOD> Usually that ends up w a long windup into being hit out of it
<GOOD> Like using the X combo when a monster whiffs an attack is just a monster hunter thing
<GOOD> That's not adapting it was what I was already doing
<GOOD> Like Khezu didn't teach me any sort of lesson except stop this thing sucks
<GOOD> Yeah if I get to the third hit
<GOOD> And being aware of how wide the cleave is and where Khezu's head hurtbox is isn't like a thing it teaches you
<GOOD> It's trivia
<GOOD> I understand these are things to punish Khezu but like, the monster is still a bad monster
<GOOD> Did you learn this naturally with the monster or like
<GOOD> At least I don't have to fight it again
<GOOD> If I do I'll just beat its ass
<GOOD> What are you talking about
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah I'm just not bothering
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> I'm just not bothering
<GOOD> Usually the backhop just causes me to whiff the attack that comes after
<GOOD> Same as Adept dodging an attack and running towards the monster only for them to just be too far away
<GOOD> The monster is Khezu
<GOOD> I can manage
<GOOD> Yeah but I basically always just raw dodge w SnS
<GOOD> Because with adept it's better a lot of the time
<GOOD> Backhop barely ever pays off for me
<GOOD> Esp considering I have block for an emergency
<GOOD> I mean you *are* locked into a sorta bad counter attack
<GOOD> It's just not the same one
<GOOD> Yeah but it's still not the best
<GOOD> Ok whatever I'm wrong ok
<GOOD> I just don't want to fight Khezu because it's dogshit boring
<GOOD> Like I don't care about if I have to change my approach since I've done that for many many monsters, I just don't care because Khezu is boring
<GOOD> I would, because it's boring
<GOOD> Even if I learned it, it would not be an interesting fight
<GOOD> Because it wouldn't be threatening
<GOOD> And yet fighting them can be fun
<GOOD> I fought that blue bear thing the other day, easy as shit but it was still fun
<GOOD> Khezu is basically just a combination of boring aspects of monsters for me
<GOOD> You have to fight it, it spends as much time as possible using disruption attacks or ones that aren't threatening but just annoying, its biggest distinguishing quality is that it's annoying and weird looking
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It doesn't feel interesting or hype or anything to fight
<GOOD> I get the lack of music contributes to it but holy fuck
<GOOD> (Oh also like his actually threatening attacks that do damage are really really really easy to dodge)
<GOOD> I've been informed bowguns suck in this game so I didn't try them
<GOOD> Bow was ok ig
<GOOD> Aiming the spiky ball shot is annoying ish
<GOOD> I mean suck as in how you use them
<GOOD> Nah a diff friend
<GOOD> And how they aim
<GOOD> I mean my opinions are wrong so
<GOOD> Boo womp
<GOOD> The only time I mention bowguns is when I mention medium bowguns to piss off a friend
<GOOD> I don't know what that means
<GOOD> I would assume the length of a greatsword counts as a mechanic yes
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Very long medium bowgun
<GOOD> Also I managed to do all of World and its postgame without ever using Demondrug
<GOOD> Minus like a few arch tempered monsters
<GOOD> And I didn't even try them because I didn't like fighting them all that much
<GOOD> Being easy doesn't make something fun
<GOOD> I just tried to make that point
<GOOD> Like if I have to kill 50 jaggi, that isn't hard it's just boring
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> There is a point where something just isn't worth it
<GOOD> This isn't that point but still
<GOOD> Like if you have to fight a monster that makes you bounce constantly, causes paralysis on hit frequently, has a ton of annoying attacks but doesn't actually hurt despite it taking forever to kill, I probably wouldn't kill that monster
<GOOD> (Oh also I didn't mention this but I fought Khezu with yellow durability because I wasn't aware green was even accessible properly)
<GOOD> So it just made it take absurdly long to get anywhere
<GOOD> Because about 2/3 of my attacks would just bounce
<GOOD> And if the attack bounced it wouldn't interrupt Khezu
<GOOD> So he would just use the AoE over and over
<GOOD> Also like in future is the game plan for monsters to just let them come to me then
<GOOD> Then what was the point
<GOOD> Like I understand the concept of a monster being wrong but huh
<GOOD> But the lesson taught was keep attacking and it'll stagger
<GOOD> Because that's the best way to go at it
<GOOD> I would say Lagombi for a lot of the time is one of those
<GOOD> Because it doesn't stop moving until it's right there
<GOOD> I didn't really learn anything
<GOOD> I didn't really mind
<GOOD> I was just like omg Lapin One Piece and then it was an ok hunt
<GOOD> Idk whether I should bother picking up a ranged weapon
<GOOD> Grinding for ammo sounds annoying
<GOOD> Yeah which is why I don't want to
<GOOD> I know MH is about grinding but sometimes I just wanna go I hunta da monsta
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I'll just use my handy flowchart
<GOOD> Idek what a fated four is, I imagine they're elder dragons
<GOOD> If they're slow, X combo
If they're fast, dodge into them, A and X
<GOOD> Yeah I haven't fought them
<GOOD> It can't be worse than Khezu
<GOOD> It's the withering blowhog of this game
<GOOD> I mean that's why I gave up on Valor GS
<GOOD> And when I use Aerial Hammer I use the Aerial aspect most of the time
<GOOD> And I use sword and shield
<GOOD> The issue was using GS
<GOOD> Not using Valor
<GOOD> It was so SLOW
<GOOD> I know that's the point but hooooly shit
<GOOD> Like normal Hammer is just about bearable because you can actually do your chain without being staggered
<GOOD> Why is there a Baki crossover
<GOOD> Also, why can't I find many good actual resources on what weapons look like and stuff
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Just like, what some items make, what certain crossover and event download stuff looks like
<GOOD> (Also I want the airship hammer but I have no clue how to get the materials rip)
<GOOD> Ok I need the giant meat hammer
<GOOD> There's one that's just a cat too
<GOOD> Ok khezu may be worth it
<GOOD> I may actually use the bullfango one
<GOOD> Poik
<GOOD> Will you be playing
<GOOD> This lesson is so boring man I wanna go do my therapy book
<GOOD> I'm so pissed off at myself
<GOOD> Hate maths
<GOOD> Making me angry at myself for tiny mistakes
<GOOD> Basic fucking standard form operations
<GOOD> The hidden gem remains hidden
<GOOD> I can't cope with tiny mistakes, I'm only on the part of my workbook that called me out on it rather than fixing it
<GOOD> Ahhh I hate this
<GOOD> And yeah ik but neither are video games and I still do
<GOOD> Mistakes
<GOOD> Stupid mistakes
<GOOD> Also this book literally calls me out on everything and I stopped on the chapter before the part where it starts helping me
<GOOD> So now I just feel called out and can't fix it
<GOOD> This mf wins every offscreen matchup guaranteed
<GOOD> Only brown haki can beat him now
<GOOD> Himguma needs to come and save us
<GOOD> Literally speedblitzed Shanks' entire crew frfr
<GOOD> Spending it all on vbuck
<GOOD> Raaaaagh I just got 2 rare carves I needed
<GOOD> Spoon
<GOOD> Do you know the best early game bow
<GOOD> I don't get why Petrified is always so good
<GOOD> I can't make any of the others rn rip
<GOOD> I made the Blango bow instead
<GOOD> And upgraded it to a water bow
<GOOD> I wonder what bow style is most fun
<GOOD> Also how do phials work do I just get them, apply them and fire away
<GOOD> Who are Angry Beavers
<GOOD> Bows seem hard
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Really hard
<GOOD> uh, if I equip the bow it takes my clothes off
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> I was wondering why there was a clone of every equipment but worse
<GOOD> Yeah I just made a snazzy new one
<GOOD> Now I just gotta learn how to use the bow
<GOOD> How do you lock on btw
<GOOD> It's happened by accident a few times
<GOOD> SPOON HELP
<GOOD> I MEANT HELP W THIS
<GOOD> What the fuck is happening I came here to fight Bullfango
<GOOD> I don't understand bow
<GOOD> Like at all
<GOOD> Yeah but why does basically every shot miss
<GOOD> Even with lock on and the gunner aim
<GOOD> It took that long to kill 2 great jaggia
<GOOD> I don't understand why the bow will just fire at the wrong height
<GOOD> Or have no method of snapping to an enemy or ways to distance yourself apart from backstep
<GOOD> I just don't get it then
<GOOD> Because how am I meant to create distance without movement tools
<GOOD> Or not miss shots with how frantic it is and no assistance in aiming while I still have to charge shots
<GOOD> Not on others
<GOOD> Like Lagombi, Blagonga, etc
<GOOD> They are constantly on top of you
<GOOD> I was struggling even on normal great jaggia
<GOOD> I just wish it wasn't so clunky at times
<GOOD> Like I was just hunting and EVERY TIME I WENT INTO AIM VIEW, it aimed straight at the floor
<GOOD> That feels
<GOOD> Like I'm losing out on a lot of DPS
<GOOD> Like at least with GS you can confirm a hit far better
<GOOD> I'm not a speedrunner
<GOOD> I can't hit all my shots
<GOOD> It just feels like I'm fighting the controls often
<GOOD> There's no real lockon system so frantic monsters are fucking impossible to hit
<GOOD> I feel too immobile playing it
<GOOD> Then again that's the case w bow as well
<GOOD> Because it seems to rely on the monster constantly being far away and stationary
<GOOD> Idk it just doesn't seem that fun to do
<GOOD> Having to fight with the game to hit shots feels wrong
<GOOD> Why would they actively deter connecting shots
<GOOD> Idk like half of the weapons in this game feel completely gated off to me due to the game being incredibly clunky
<GOOD> Like losing your charge constantly feels awful
<GOOD> And spacing being down to just slowly walking around with a ranged weapon is like
<GOOD> Feels so counterintuitive
<GOOD> Don't lock on, don't aim, and exclusively take almost blind shots
<GOOD> Like it says it fires exactly where it goes but you can't tell whether it's too high or too low
<GOOD> Yeah but then how do I angle at all
<GOOD> And when I dodge an attack, do I just keep walking away
<GOOD> But that definitely won't happen
<GOOD> Unless it's like, Bulldrome
<GOOD> Walking doesn't cut it in most situations
<GOOD> Is Great Maccio too strong or something?
<GOOD> *small
<GOOD> Not strong
<GOOD> I don't understand because most of my shots were still going at wild angles
<GOOD> And if there was any height difference I could forget it
<GOOD> Yeah that just didn't work
<GOOD> Because I tried using, yk, the actual mechanics of the bow
<GOOD> Instead of just holding R
<GOOD> Rapid
<GOOD> I don't know the range at which arrows split
<GOOD> And also my issue isn't knowing the range it's being at it
<GOOD> Like I have to just:
Walk away
Monster uses a dive attack
Walk away
Monster follows me
Walk away
<GOOD> When do I get to shoot if they keep doing stuff like that
<GOOD> Just.... never?
<GOOD> I mean when I don't overreact I eat an attack
<GOOD> Because walking away from a monster doesn't always work
<GOOD> And yet if they miss I still have to then walk away to space
<GOOD> As it gets into the windup of another attack
<GOOD> It can in the multiple seconds it takes to walk away, turn, aim the shot and fire
<GOOD> It's just really really annoying when the shot just flies off somewhere because I tried to shoot while turning
<GOOD> Because if I don't it doesn't have time to hit
<GOOD> I don't like how this game makes me not use most of the kit of the weapon
<GOOD> It just feels spammy
<GOOD> Not really
<GOOD> What, don't use the part of the kit that came with your weapon because it's suboptimal?
<GOOD> The aim view on the bow is really shitty feeling
<GOOD> And I've been told hipfiring is better in most situations
<GOOD> But it doesn't aim at the correct angle
<GOOD> It will aim at the floor if there's like an inch of height between the floor you're standing on and them
<GOOD> What's confusing about it
<GOOD> The aiming mechanic is shitty, it doesn't work and it's often better to not use it
<GOOD> Yes, because MH games have never been clunky
<GOOD> Like my issue comes from the jank
<GOOD> Sniper aim in concept? Good
<GOOD> Sniper aim with how it was implemented? It just doesn't work
<GOOD> It just seems like, useless
<GOOD> Every time I've attempted to use it it's either aimed wrong or been worse than hip aim
<GOOD> I mean you shouldn't be in close quarters combat regardless
<GOOD> Doesn't it have dropoff the closer you are
<GOOD> It does mean very close tho
<GOOD> Bruh
<GOOD> What's the purpose of it being ranged I'm so confused
<GOOD> If I'm meant to be that close
<GOOD> That's like, way way way closer than I've been fighting
<GOOD> I kinda wish I knew that before trying to snipe enemies
<GOOD> Because I assumed that was what I was meant to be doing
<GOOD> Man I'm just too ass at this game for this weapon
<GOOD> Wait now I'm even more confused
<GOOD> Is the gunner aim for when I'm fighting a far away flying enemy
<GOOD> I mean it doesn't work that well far away in general bc it'll usually fly off
<GOOD> Yeah I was just barely managing to hit Great Maccao
<GOOD> I was under the impression I had to be an entire Great Maccao hop attack away
<GOOD> Like the kick attack
<GOOD> That's also probably why I was confused as to when I'm supposed to fire
<GOOD> And why I was confused why valor style was good if it locked you in place and made you fire 3 shots in the same direction
<GOOD> Probably also helps it is a less unwieldy game
<GOOD> I don't think it's even a learning curve thing
<GOOD> Like even if the game is learnable with its jank, it doesn't make it less janky it makes it tolerable
<GOOD> I know it's possible to be good with it, but it's easier to be good when the game is easier to control
<GOOD> Heya Obie
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> I feel bad again
<GOOD> I think the book called it smth like an 'at-risk situation'
<GOOD> I'm gonna do more of the workbook tomorrow
<GOOD> Hai Rosie
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Oh I'm sixk
<GOOD> Sick
<GOOD> I didn't even realise because I'm woozy af lmao
<GOOD> Also hai Frawy
<GOOD> I might buy Banjo in Smash
<GOOD> Mmm making myself breakfast only to realise the milk tastes fucking rancid
<GOOD> This is not going to be a good day
<GOOD> I might buy Banjo Kazooie
<GOOD> The Smash character not the game
<GOOD> I resisted the urge to buy expensive hot food despite being ill wahoo
<GOOD> What this actually looks fun
<GOOD> You see this looks fucking awesome but I still don't think I want Frontiers even tho this is so cool aaaa
<GOOD> Looks fun
<GOOD> That's kinda one of my bigger gripes with Frontiers but whatever
<GOOD> As long as the platforming is good
<GOOD> I just wish that Frontiers wasn't just
Open world Unity looking area, but with rails and shit thrown everywhere
<GOOD> Like idk how you could fix that issue but whatever
<GOOD> I feel like such a classic sonic asshole rn but it just doesn't feel Sonic-y to me, which is probably the point but whatever
<GOOD> Yeah it's just like, floating items and random stuff
<GOOD> I can't cop Superstars rip
<GOOD> No money
<GOOD> Saving for Wonder anyway
<GOOD> I mean I have a Mario bias but
<GOOD> Come on
<GOOD> Superstars still looks good tho
<GOOD> I mean like, Wonder is just oozing with personality
<GOOD> (Also I fucking love how the models look like older illustrations of the enemies aaaa it's so cool)
<GOOD> They nailed the aesthetic so well
<GOOD> Plus all the enemies are way more expressive this time
<GOOD> Huge fan and the colours are so vibrant
<GOOD> I mean I hope that still happens sometimes
<GOOD> Also they put King Boo in a new trailer omg
<GOOD> I love king boo
<GOOD> He's so cute I love how the boos look
<GOOD> They have the 3 eyebrows
<GOOD> Yeah I'm so hyped for this game aaa
<GOOD> It could easily be my favourite 2D mario
<GOOD> I mean 1 2 3 works better
<GOOD> Luigi's Mansion 1 is on 3DS?
<GOOD> I honestly never knew that
<GOOD> Anyway fuck now I really want SM Wonder
<GOOD> But I also want Pimin 3 and 4 but ugh
<GOOD> I can't decide
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I may have to stave off the desire for more by playing Hey Pikmin
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Oya chat, I am back
<GOOD> I marinaded my first chicken
<GOOD> It will be yummy later
<GOOD> Oh I have a health and safety talk later
<GOOD> That's gonna be annoying
<GOOD> Uhhhh I don't like bowguns
<GOOD> So bow
<GOOD> I just took some rancid ass medicine
<GOOD> Like not even artificially flavoured
<GOOD> World isn't too bad
<GOOD> It's very fun at times
<GOOD> Still fuming that this happened while I was practicing the bow on a Bullfango
<GOOD> I have 3U and 4U on my 3DS now
<GOOD> But not playing them
<GOOD> I should probably keep trying bow later
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> When I initially tried bow I could shoot like, an AoE shot?
<GOOD> It would rain spiky ball things and it's cool
<GOOD> Do you mean like the valor style thing?
<GOOD> Or the coating
<GOOD> Or wha
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah I didn't know that
<GOOD> I thought that was a valor thing?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Because like, Valor adds the same thing but with 2 shots instead of 1
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Also I found a thing
<GOOD> In valor style you can like glow blue when you sheath a weapon, but if you attack while sheathing you go into like a crouched shot stance
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I was wondering why I glowed blue
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Does that prevent knockdown then
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah I didn't know any of this
<GOOD> I already have enough required reading for therapy raaaagh
<GOOD> Yeah I'm prob gonna watch them just not rn
<GOOD> Also when I brought up BG to my friend she said it was for babies
<GOOD> The sidestep on Valor GS is so helpful
<GOOD> If only I enjoyed GS
<GOOD> Guys I should use aerial bow that would be so fun right haha
<GOOD> (Theres a point where a weapon's viability does impede on the fun you have)
<GOOD> Also is blade wire a good skill
<GOOD> It's what I've been using bc it's easy to hit
<GOOD> Yeah I was so confused
<GOOD> Yeah I might switch
<GOOD> Idk whay style tho
<GOOD> Maybe I could try alchemy because it seems funny, but I kinda want smth that makes me a tad more agile
<GOOD> So maybe adept is best
<GOOD> I'm gonna keep training w bow but it may be more of a multiplayer pick since I'm comfier taking potshots when there's a bit of aggro taken off
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Bc when I'm pinned down I panic so much
<GOOD> Even with hammer I was so panicked fighting Blagonga
<GOOD> Because it's so fast and I kept making the same mistake on one attack (until I finally learned it)
<GOOD> I kept falling for the attack where he jumps and reaches his arm out
<GOOD> Yeah but eventually I learned if I dodged to the right I'd avoid the attack
<GOOD> Oh r/truerateme
<GOOD> Yuck
<GOOD> Me detecting the bone structure of the woman I met on Tinder
<GOOD> She looks dead in the 3rd image lmao
<GOOD> Like head empty
<GOOD> Emails I get from quora are so funny
<GOOD> What the fuck does this mean
<GOOD> The answer was just a dude saying nah
<GOOD> Quora trolls are goofy
<GOOD> I am truly /srs when I discuss lore with women
<GOOD> I can't believe this, women are taking all our women  /j
<GOOD> Omg Rebdit Gold
<GOOD> If you ever start your message with Aha! I will ignore you
<GOOD> Guaranteed
<GOOD> Eureka is based
<GOOD> It makes my day
<GOOD> I don't think it's legit
<GOOD> It's just written by a human
<GOOD> Punk you just made me burst out laughing in a lecture
<GOOD> And I've seen that image before it just always gets me
<GOOD> Banger song after all these years
<GOOD> Animation kinda dated tho
<GOOD> FNAF movie ending leaked
<GOOD> Yrsh post credits scene too
<GOOD> What are you talking about
<GOOD> That's Markiplier
<GOOD> Paper pals reference!?!?!?
<GOOD> Vbuck inflation NOOOO
<GOOD> I know this sounds dumb but like
<GOOD> Is Epic that bad for the layoffs if they gave everyone 6 months severance
<GOOD> Like, I imagine the other option is paycuts across the board?
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> I have no idea about that fellow so
<GOOD> I've just seen ppl treating Epic like a boogeyman for doing an agreeable and standard business practice
<GOOD> Hell, I'd even say it isn't the standard
<GOOD> I assume the complaints are more about the sudden random spike
<GOOD> If they can make a better lead up then absolutely
<GOOD> Also  I took your advice and holy fuck bow is fun
<GOOD> For the Sonic thing I'm saying if Sonic can actually create a curve up to that point then it would be way better
<GOOD> Like as is, it seems great, but since base Frontiers was just incredibly easy then the DLC being incredibly bullshit hard isn't the greatest
<GOOD> If any game has a gigantic spike it's applicable
<GOOD> I mean respectfully it's just a different opinion but sure let's go with that
<GOOD> You haven't beaten the thing either so I wouldn't be so cocky about it
<GOOD> Especially since it started with you laughing at other people
<GOOD> What are you talking about
<GOOD> Like I say something about a game because you're making fun of people with an opinion on it, you make random comments and then call me a troll, and then say this
<GOOD> I'm not trying to argue mate, I didn't even say anything like that until you said I was trolling for like no reason
<GOOD> But ig that's my fault so
<GOOD> Tired of this man
<GOOD> Me when I hit my head and think it's still 2018
<GOOD> Oh jeez that was a long hunt
<GOOD> But so free
<GOOD> Gypceros is such a fun hunt w Adept Bow
<GOOD> Perfect training too
<GOOD> Isn't this that thing in all the sci fi movies where they see the atrocities of humanity and become sentient and evil
<GOOD> Fr
<GOOD> That sounds about right
<GOOD> Man I wanted a print of one of the Pokmon Van Gogh arts
<GOOD> Fat chance
<GOOD> I'm inclined to disagree because I've played the fighting games
<GOOD> Yeah it's fucked
<GOOD> I just hate Shigechi because he's mildly annoying in the fighting game smh
<GOOD> Why did I think you were talking about Diddy Kong
<GOOD> I'm basic so I like Funky
<GOOD> It def is
<GOOD> He's like one of the fan favourite kongs
<GOOD> Isn't there like a side story where he makes food that cures cancer or smth
<GOOD> Okuyasu's dad is so bizarre like I lowkey forgot he existed
<GOOD> Fuck I said bizarre
<GOOD> Oh imo you def will later on
<GOOD> The other parts have some detestable fellows
<GOOD> I think Kars has a bit on Kira
<GOOD> I only have to assume we aren't thinking of the same guy
<GOOD> Yeah nah I'm not in the True Man's World I'm fucking APOLLO 11
<GOOD> YEAH WOOOOO BABY
<GOOD> Rikiel
<GOOD> At least she can keep her eyes open
<GOOD> That dude was fucked up bro
<GOOD> Can't even keep his eyes open
<GOOD> Don't, it's best to take your time
<GOOD> (Part 4 is better than 5 anyway)
<GOOD> That's only just about over halfway through
<GOOD> I think 5 is overrated but still good
<GOOD> 4 is my 2nd favourite
<GOOD> 7 is my favourite because basic
<GOOD> Yeah Green Green Grass of Home
<GOOD> The best stand in part 6 is Dragon's Dream
<GOOD> Feng sui monologue!!!!!!
<GOOD> Dw you can skip some parts D (the part is part 8 raaaagh)
<GOOD> I will never stop slandering Jojolion
<GOOD> I just don't like... it?
<GOOD> Yeah that doesn't change
<GOOD> I mean it was after part 7 I absolutely had expectations
<GOOD> Because it's a parallel timeline
<GOOD> So the characters are alternate takes on them
<GOOD> There is no Josuke 7, just Josuk8
<GOOD> I won't talk about it much but it really lost me near the end
<GOOD> You could literally start at part 7 and it wouldn't impact anything
<GOOD> Not really, the parts are super creative
<GOOD> I haven't read much of part 9 tbh I probably should
<GOOD> The latest chapter I read was the one where ||Alternate Rohan is literally just himself||
<GOOD> And I found it funny af
<GOOD> Araki is his self insert fr
<GOOD> SBR is widely considered as one of the best, and I think Jojolion is too idk
<GOOD> I just really didn't like Gappy so
<GOOD> Well idk, the main cast in general wasn't very... likeable is probably the best word for me to pick
<GOOD> 4
<GOOD> 4
<GOOD> Guys... yk what's funnier than 4
<GOOD> 5
<GOOD> Yeah I love it too, let me look at all the cool moments it ge-
<GOOD> (My favourite protag stand in the part is probably Moody Blues)
<GOOD> Minecraft
<GOOD> Minecraft
<GOOD> Holy shit part 7
<GOOD> I think my favourite protag cast stands for each part are
Heirophant Green (haha it's so bad)
The Hand
Moody Blues
Can't decide DD and WR are too good
Part 7 ||probably ball buster or smth even if it's kinda not a stand but also is|| heavy spoilers
Part 8 idfk they're all kinda mid bro
<GOOD> I will now be boiled alive for saying Part 8 has bad stands
<GOOD> I hate the second one
<GOOD> I forgot what the first one is
<GOOD> Actually ||Fun Fun Fun|| is a hilarious stand
<GOOD> I like that one
<GOOD> Because it's so ass
<GOOD> Actually I take it back since Part 8 has the best villain stand imo (not gonna talk about it)
<GOOD> I still don't like, get the draw of part 8 tho
<GOOD> I'll leave it be
<GOOD> No it's been ages
<GOOD> I can't put it into words tho bc I'm stoopid
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I just wish uh
<GOOD> There were some issues with parts that weren't the stand
<GOOD> And I wish those weren't the case
<GOOD> Idk it ||kinda dragged, like a massive amount in the middle and then the end couldn't cash the cheque it wrote||
<GOOD> ||I think Tooru was introduced way too late and had no real relevance and it's annoying af||
<GOOD> At least their design is cool
<GOOD> I don't like basically any of them in the way I like the other parts' cast
<GOOD> Except Norisuke
<GOOD> He's pretty fun
<GOOD> It's decent
<GOOD> Oh and I'm just gonna say rn but ||Go Beyond is by far the worst asspull Araki has written||
<GOOD> It made me actually angry
<GOOD> It's different
<GOOD> Different is the best word probably
<GOOD> I have it low
<GOOD> Almost fell asleep during the ||Gas Football arc|| fr
<GOOD> I know it's not actually an arc
<GOOD> I had to google who this was because I just call him ||plant dude||
<GOOD> He's very sick tho yes
<GOOD> Has my favourite moment in part 8 by far
<GOOD> I've heard the combat ain't the best either
<GOOD> Malfestio was so cool wtf
<GOOD> Now I have 4 star quests
<GOOD> Time to hunt Nargacuga
<GOOD> That was a fun hunt
<GOOD> Nargacuga was fun af
<GOOD> Made me feel like a badass w the adept dodges
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I think that my Bow is still the best I can get rn despite it not being on the guide
<GOOD> Well sorta
<GOOD> I have lv 4 petrified bow that has the same damage as this, but this bow has water element and better coatings
<GOOD> Rathian time
<GOOD> I'll check
<GOOD> I believe it's rapid
<GOOD> Nvm it's focus
<GOOD> Arc shot focus
<GOOD> Spongia bow
<GOOD> Also there's a damage diff of 10 on it compared to the petrified bow so
<GOOD> Probably that, I didn't notice
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ugh I gotta hunt iodromes now
<GOOD> Boring
<GOOD> Yeah I'm not doing that many iodrome hunts in a row
<GOOD> My brain will rot
<GOOD> Dall E 3 is so goofy
<GOOD> Look at this shit
<GOOD> Imma not send many more but I fucking love Dall E 3, it's such a step up
<GOOD> Dall E 3 released to everyone today if you use the Bing AI thing
<GOOD> Very polished, it can even do fingers and text right sometimes
<GOOD> Bing AI
<GOOD> It's connected to Dall E 3
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Also my favourite things have been creating raw af images or putting characters in other shows as if it was just a still
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> Yuck
<GOOD> You need Microsoft edge
<GOOD> Then just google Bing AI and it should work
<GOOD> Too much stuff so it fucks up
<GOOD> yes
<GOOD> Also I tried just Goku and Jotaro fighting and ngl Jotaro in DB goes hard af
<GOOD> It could work
<GOOD> Try and make it generate text or smth
<GOOD> Or anything w hands
<GOOD> If it does it pretty well you're probably attached to Dall E 3
<GOOD> YO WHAT
<GOOD> No idea, I said to test it
<GOOD> It was powered by dall e but if it's dall e 2 then like
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> You ask it to make images
<GOOD> Perfect
<GOOD> I love this
<GOOD> Yeah still not always perfect w hands but definitely a step up from before
<GOOD> It's interesting but also scary
<GOOD> Goes hard
<GOOD> Shadow FNAF
<GOOD> Najarala was such a sick fight wtf
<GOOD> GU
<GOOD> I'm just doing main story progress
<GOOD> Adept Bow rn
<GOOD> I also play Adept S&S and Aerial Hammer
<GOOD> I don't understand GS
<GOOD> Like it just feels like
<GOOD> So, so slow
<GOOD> And easily whiffable
<GOOD> I only really felt fast when I had Valor active which ig is the point
<GOOD> But I suck at using it so
<GOOD> If this is required for the next urgent quest I'm softlocked fr
<GOOD> Damn I need Lava Nuggets to upgrade this bow
<GOOD> And it says I need 5 star quests for that
<GOOD> Womp womp
<GOOD> Also when do I fight Tigrex
<GOOD> It seems like a few things I need come from them
<GOOD> Aren't they massively scaled up tho
<GOOD> Like they're made for multiplayer not me
<GOOD> That's a lot
<GOOD> Gonna get my revenge on Khezu
<GOOD> Fucksake
<GOOD> I immediately got carted by the 2 Khezu
<GOOD> One roared as the other one shocked me, then as I was lying on the floor I got shocked again, and then they roared and I died
<GOOD> Yeah it won't be able to touch you trust
<GOOD> This is why I said I wasn't gonna fight Khezu ffs
<GOOD> It sucks so bad
<GOOD> Worst monster by far still
<GOOD> One mistake and I died
<GOOD> I'm never hunting this stupid ass monster agsin
<GOOD> I mean that roar was literally the first time they appeared
<GOOD> There was 1 opportunity to throw a dung bomb if I had one
<GOOD> That one time I aimed instead was the moment
<GOOD> And I fucked it up
<GOOD> I did say but Khezu arrived as that clip started
<GOOD> That roar was the second they noticed me and I realised about a second before that that it was there
<GOOD> I mean this issue is exclusively with Khezu so there is an easy solution
<GOOD> It's just such a frustrating fight
<GOOD> I was struggling with just one of them because he did something I literally hadn't seen before and it gave me thunderblight
<GOOD> So I had to run and eat a nulberry which is when the second one appeared so I couldn't heal properly
<GOOD> I got hit once
<GOOD> I got hit because I tried aiming once
<GOOD> Which meant I immediately died wahoo
<GOOD> Literally no other monster in this game even annoys me except Khezu
<GOOD> But Khezu itself makes me want to throw my controller whenever I even try to fight it
<GOOD> I just wanna ignore it forever tbh
<GOOD> I mean
<GOOD> I don't need to fight it
<GOOD> I could just never do it
<GOOD> Well that was a boring 20 minutes
<GOOD> It was just kinda annoying because of all the Blangos
<GOOD> I'm just taking a break because I'm so pissed off at that Khezu hunt
<GOOD> Genuinely would prefer playing the game without demondrug at all to actually hunting them for it
<GOOD> Marine biology
<GOOD> Or will be if I pass
<GOOD> See? I don't have to hunt it
<GOOD> Probably the first time you hunt it
<GOOD> Which is why I hate it in the first place
<GOOD> It doesn't make sense that Khezu would be a hub key later than that
<GOOD> My flatmates are talking about how they got drunk and shouted slurs at 1am
<GOOD> Because they did ig
<GOOD> Pissed me off because it basically meant I was awake as long as they were
<GOOD> Also Because of the other obvious reason I'd be annoyed at them shouting slurs
<GOOD> They have 0 volume control sometimes istg
<GOOD> I feel like such an old codger for complaining about the noise in a university tho
<GOOD> Glad that I don't have to hunt this one then
<GOOD> I don't really mind a monster being boring, I mind it being a time waster
<GOOD> Khezu eats up so much time doing NOTHING
<GOOD> Lao afaik is boring because they just go in a straight line right
<GOOD> I don't actually mind that bc at least I can whale on it until it's finally over
<GOOD> Khezu is different because I don't get to attack it since it's wasting so much time Roaring and doing the AoE
<GOOD> I'm aware but it's absurdly annoying
<GOOD> Because there isn't much telegraphing
<GOOD> I cut myself while Shaving
<GOOD> Womp womp
<GOOD> Yep just some blood
<GOOD> The Khezu quest is a key quest
<GOOD> Guess I'm not progressibg
<GOOD> Well that was a boring hunt
<GOOD> Liking it  best
<GOOD> Yeah, having an opinion on someone else's opinion is fine too
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> Gen 2 has like, so many issues
<GOOD> It has some absolutely wild choices
<GOOD> Getting better tho
<GOOD> Yes it makes sense but that doesn't excuse the choices really (on top of some other huge issues like the teams)
<GOOD> Like not even talking about the level curve blah blah blah, most major fights are sooooo bad
<GOOD> Yes and a lot of the issues in the game can be fixed without requiring some sort of upgrade
<GOOD> Ik but the game is still what it is
<GOOD> Also I just hunted Uragaan with an aerial hammer, worst mistake of my life
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> At least imo
<GOOD> Gen 3 has a solid remake, a good main trio of games ~~and mediocre spinoffs if you aren't talking about RS pinball~~
<GOOD> I thought it would break the jaw easier
<GOOD> (The jaw didn't break at all because I couldn't hit it)
<GOOD> I need 2 more Iodrome violet scales so ig I'm hunting tomorrow
<GOOD> Hunting iodrome is so boring
<GOOD> I mean at least it isn't Blagonga
<GOOD> Blagonga is boring and annoying at the same time
<GOOD> I hunta da monsta
<GOOD> I haven't used BG yet
<GOOD> I only played World
<GOOD> Doesn't 1 like
<GOOD> Exist
<GOOD> Does world not have atmosphere
<GOOD> Also why not judge 1 by current standards rather than the standards when it released
<GOOD> So what redeeming factors does it have
<GOOD> Is that bad or just an observation
<GOOD> Xeno feels justified
<GOOD> Tbf I'm not gonna act like I care whether I'm morally right in caving their head in with a giant hammer
<GOOD> Because I kinda forget MH has a story
<GOOD> I got bored of World when I got to postgame
<GOOD> I think the furthest I got was that mission w 2 tempered Bazelgeuse and then the arch tempered monsters who kinda suck
<GOOD> Yeah I just can't do that
<GOOD> Eventually fighting the same monster or monster reskin absolutely wrecks my patience
<GOOD> I'm happy GU gives you a bunch of free shit on Switch so I don't have to grind and I can just enjoy the game
<GOOD> (Yes ik MH is a grindy series I just enjoy the hunting part)
<GOOD> ((And therefore every shortcut I can take I will))
<GOOD> So happy it can do fingers and text now
<GOOD> What does that mean and is it good or bad
<GOOD> Explain
<GOOD> Also what makes something the most like an RPG
<GOOD> We have archived that channel due to it being a few weeks after the release of the DLC
<GOOD> Wait nvm sorrt
<GOOD> Can you not see
<GOOD> Tbf there has to be balance
<GOOD> If you're stuck in a long tutorial it can put you off, but if there is ZERO explanation then like
<GOOD> It can't do Olimar either
<GOOD> Dall E 3 is so strange tho
<GOOD> It's such a massive jump
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Yeah Dall E 3 is crazy
<GOOD> Dall E 2 was like, mediocre at best
<GOOD> But jesus christ this thing is a massive leap
<GOOD> Bro these images go hard as fuck
<GOOD> HARD images (not for snowflakes)
<GOOD> Too much concentrated peak
<GOOD> Also do we know what Dall E 3's information is up to
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is those if they were actually good manga and the protagonist wasn't insufferable
<GOOD> I meant what it knows
<GOOD> Does it know what a recent event is and can it generate an image of a new character
<GOOD> Or is it limited to like 2020 rn
<GOOD> Oh also making images look like stills from the show is always fun
<GOOD> Seems so
<GOOD> I think with correct piloting you can get some fucking insane images from this, bc like without any details it creates good images
<GOOD> This looks cool btw
<GOOD> Not bad
<GOOD> It'll obviously fuck up a few
<GOOD> The future of shitposting is here
<GOOD> It creates Pikmin just fine, in fact when you ask it to make Olimar it makes Pikmin
<GOOD> Tired
<GOOD> Yippee no more iodrome hunting
<GOOD> Goku when any random conceptual enemy
<GOOD> Doesn't stand a chance fr
<GOOD> Kagurabachi>>>Saitama>Goku
<GOOD> Frfr
<GOOD> Kagura Bachi has already achieved his infinite potential
<GOOD> Therefore his power is now infinite
<GOOD> Nah bc Saitama is growing towards infinite potential
<GOOD> He'll never arrive there because he would be one shot
<GOOD> That one just isn't true, it's based on the time spent fighting
<GOOD> He grows exponentially
<GOOD> Unfortunately will never be enough to beat Kagura Bachi
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> This didn't happen
<GOOD> Saitama did not do that
<GOOD> There's this one advert I keep seeing with that music so it's been ruined for me
<GOOD> Blast
<GOOD> Yeah portals and gravity
<GOOD> Saitama can do that
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> With a sneeze
<GOOD> Yes I've read the manga
<GOOD> Also I'm officially so still that the lights that detect if someone is in the room went off
<GOOD> Also also, idk what anime to watch
<GOOD> Maybe a shonen
<GOOD> Because powerscaling
<GOOD> But idk which shonen womp womp
<GOOD> A lot of ppl think Goku does
<GOOD> I've already finished Jojo
<GOOD> The thing is Saitama just does that but faster
<GOOD> Goku ain't even the strongest mf in his own universe
<GOOD> Broly is basically the saitama of DB
<GOOD> Or Garou ig
<GOOD> I mean a bunch of ppl still clear Goku
<GOOD> Beerus, the angels, Broly, even Vegeta
<GOOD> Gogeta is part Goku so doesn't really count
<GOOD> Gogeta *barely* beat Broly before Broly overtook them
<GOOD> He def can
<GOOD> In fact he already did with TUI or whatever that bullshit is called
<GOOD> True Ultra Instinct
<GOOD> No it's actually a bit weaker than MUI
<GOOD> It's just easier to maintain
<GOOD> And lasts longer
<GOOD> MTUI can't exist as they are contradictory
<GOOD> Zero
<GOOD> Fan animations are often fine
<GOOD> Also of course Goku would get stronger
<GOOD> He has Zenkai boosts + he has to because if he didn't the fans would be like ughhhh why isn't he a trillion times stronger already
<GOOD> This hammer is cool
<GOOD> Also my petrified bow is now lv 5 wahoo
<GOOD> Playing Smash at the gaming club and some dude came, said he played smash at a high level for years and is being like instinctively toxic
<GOOD> Literally teabagging after every stock
<GOOD> My friend has been complaining to me about it x_x
<GOOD> So many rail collision clips
<GOOD> Funny to watch
<GOOD> Oh a SM Wonder demo came out
<GOOD> Well at PAX
<GOOD> If he's hyper he should go to bed
<GOOD> Tbh I think Wonder is probably the only game I'm excited for the rest of this year
<GOOD> It seems pretty hard (especially watching some of the combat like jeez)
<GOOD> I mean
<GOOD> That isn't the point they were making
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> It reminds me of One Piece World Seeker when I saw it
<GOOD> Isn't entirely a tad unfair
<GOOD> Most of the ones I've seen are complaints with Knuckles
<GOOD> Also is there something I'm missing w Amy I thought she had a hammer not tarot cards
<GOOD> Where are the tarot cards from
<GOOD> I have never heard of em
<GOOD> Just the big ass hammer
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Strange
<GOOD> If they can learn from their development of Frontiers and make an even better game I'm def gonna cop it
<GOOD> I'm almost certain they will tbh, it seems like a great idea to continue
<GOOD> Yeah pretty much that's exactly what I want
<GOOD> I'm not even a sonic person and that would be amazing
<GOOD> (Also some of these clips for combat look like insanity tho, I watched Sonic get knocked down and bombed relentlessly while he was still on the floor)
<GOOD> I wish my emulators worked properly so I could play them
<GOOD> I only ever played Unleashed Wii and I was a little baby and didn't like it because I sucked
<GOOD> I think the jump is the issue (and maybe some collision issues)
<GOOD> But if something makes a natural curve up to what this part of Frontiers is then it would be sick af
<GOOD> Also apparently the hard mode parry window is like, a handful of frames
<GOOD> Idk how many I forgor
<GOOD> As I said it reminds me a bit of OP World Seeker in combat where the DLCs had an absurd spike
<GOOD> Like, I turned it down to the easy piss baby mode and it took me 40 minutes to get through 1 segment that wasn't even a boss or anything
<GOOD> Because they just spammed absurdly tanky laser spam enemies
<GOOD> (OPWS is a bad game and that game's DLC was paid)
<GOOD> I've been told that base Frontiers combat was just mashing and cyloop so that seems to check out
<GOOD> It was very cinematic yes
<GOOD> I was just put off Frontiers by seeing a couple things (plus the price tag)
<GOOD> Maybe eventually I'll cop if it goes down to smth more affordable
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Also I hunted a rathalos without carting
<GOOD> It was fun but now it says I have to hunt a Mitsuzune
<GOOD> And I'm like oh no
<GOOD> I didn't wait for Rath
<GOOD> I just took potshots
<GOOD> I just didn't have any issues w them
<GOOD> Apart from maybe the poison and fireblight stacking once
<GOOD> I do need to kill rath again tho so I can craft the S&S
<GOOD> It seems great
<GOOD> Also, idk whether to get Kazuya, Min Min or Banjo in Smash
<GOOD> I feel like I want Banjo
<GOOD> I was gonna say AA
<GOOD> But it doesn't
<GOOD> Scott the woz TotK video
<GOOD> Holy hell
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> Sega has FORGOTTEN about Sonic Forces...
<GOOD> Make sure it's the DS RPG
<GOOD> Bored
<GOOD> Yeah but I don't feel like Monster Hunter rn
<GOOD> I really want Pikmin but still can't
<GOOD> RG
<GOOD> It's a very rough meta
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I meant more what were ppl cooking up before they realised there was a concrete meta
<GOOD> Also I am almost at 6 star village I think
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Mizutsune was nowhere near as hard as I expected
<GOOD> Doing Lagiacrus tomorrow and hopefully they're ok and I can get the urgent quest
<GOOD> +3 is pretty high
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> I can't commit to longer series anymore
<GOOD> Unless I read thwm
<GOOD> But like I can't watch shows
<GOOD> It feels like w Adventure Time people always gloss over the fact it is still a CN show
<GOOD> And therefore a lot of eps will be nothing
<GOOD> I need a series to watch tbh
<GOOD> I should watch owl house
<GOOD> My flatmates are being assholes rn
<GOOD> Womp womp
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Thinking of ribbon masters rn (it's hard)
<GOOD> Getting every ribbon possible on 1 pokemon
<GOOD> Ideally I wanna start from gen 3
<GOOD> I wanna choose something a bit off kilter but something I still like
<GOOD> Currently liking the idea of Cradily
<GOOD> Off-kilter just means wild
<GOOD> Strange
<GOOD> Oooo maybe Crawdaunt
<GOOD> I'm so lost rn
<GOOD> I did every quest it said I had to in GU but no other quest showed up
<GOOD> I talked to the village elder and he said to help the other village but they don't tell me anything
<GOOD> Every dialogue box has been used
<GOOD> The yellow ones at least
<GOOD> Do I need more village exp or whatever it's called?
<GOOD> Where I do quests for the villahes
<GOOD> Black sword shrine?
<GOOD> Oh that
<GOOD> Lemme try
<GOOD> Nothing
<GOOD> Maybe I missed a quest?
<GOOD> The Bherna dude had a red speech bubble and was like go help the other villages
<GOOD> But then the other villages weren't giving out quests so
<GOOD> I've already hunted one of the fated four too
<GOOD> I'll have to look what they are
<GOOD> That could be the issue
<GOOD> Just texted my mom to ask her stupid ass basic common sense questions again
<GOOD> it's not
<GOOD> I mean
<GOOD> It's meat, of course it will cook in the oven surely
<GOOD> No meat *requires* a grill right?
<GOOD> Yeah but you can cook any meat by most means
<GOOD> Even if it's wrong it's still safe
<GOOD> I'm so excited to have pork tho
<GOOD> It's my favourite meat
<GOOD> And comparatively chicken is pretty lean so like
<GOOD> Am happy and will treat myself to this sometimes
<GOOD> Crazy price tho
<GOOD> I almost bought belly pork, but that's too fatty
<GOOD> I don't trust myself to prep fish yet
<GOOD> And tbf, salmon is nice but I prefer pork
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> I've never tried any shellfish
<GOOD> I wanna try lobstah and be bougie
<GOOD> But like, no
<GOOD> Maybe when I'm rich fr
<GOOD> Treated myself to smth fancy
<GOOD> I love brioche
<GOOD> Mmmmm
<GOOD> I'm gonna slowly get more and more diverse w my meals
<GOOD> For now I'm just buying partly battered oven chicken, partly proper meat
<GOOD> Then eating w rice
<GOOD> And then I'll move onto different veg, different ways to season and prep the rice, more creative and nice meats
<GOOD> Ya I eat salad and cucumber w it
<GOOD> I probably should have bought some broccoli today
<GOOD> But I'll be sustained by cucumber
<GOOD> I'm still too worried to make fried rice lmao
<GOOD> I met a new friend on DC that is teaching me basic Welsh
<GOOD> She is very nice
<GOOD> Apparently LL is a hissing noise in Welsh
<GOOD> I think it could be beneficial for me to learn a bit of conversational welsh
<GOOD> Yuh
<GOOD> Plus a language referred to as dragonspeak would be sick to learn
<GOOD> (Occasionally referred to as it)
<GOOD> No it's just called Welsh but ppl do call it dragonspeak occasionally
<GOOD> Probably due to the aforementioned hissing noises that are present
<GOOD> The Welsh flag and general icon is a dragon
<GOOD> Literally has a weird snake tongue anyway
<GOOD> Welsh sentences look so confusing lmao
<GOOD> Here's a pronunciation example
<GOOD> Basic sentence starters
<GOOD> The hardest part of the pronunciation is LL, once you get it it's easy
<GOOD> I just gotta remember the phonetic differences
<GOOD> I mean LL isn't hard, just the hardest
<GOOD> You literally just line your tongue up as if you're about to say L, and then blow
<GOOD> Me saying Llandudno
<GOOD> (If that's even audible lmao)
<GOOD> Louder?
<GOOD> But ye
<GOOD> That's how you do it apparently
<GOOD> I can't speak much louder x_x
<GOOD> Gonna learn to say Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
<GOOD> I can currently only say Llanfairpwllgwyngyll
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Pasted it
<GOOD> I can't write in Welsh
<GOOD> It is pronounced TH-anfair-pooth-goo-win-guth-gogery-choo-uhn-buhth-luhn-tuh-silly-ow-go-go-goch
<GOOD> That's how I was pronouncing it before
<GOOD> I was a propah brexit geezah
<GOOD> Also I don't think I did too bad pronouncing that place lmao
<GOOD> I may as well start w the hardest Welsh word lmaoo
<GOOD> Also fun fact apparently jellyfish in Welsh is wibli wobli
<GOOD> Which is very funny to me
<GOOD> Nvm it's apparently slang
<GOOD> I just disproved myself
<GOOD> Guys Welsh people do not call Microwaves popty pings, it's over
<GOOD> (( sorry
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I must try and find what village quests I haven't done rn :((
<GOOD> Hello chat I have made a recipe for this weekend
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> That's what imma cook
<GOOD> Hopefully ye
<GOOD> It's my first ambitious meal
<GOOD> Very cute looking
<GOOD> Just go across the creases and smooth it out p much
<GOOD> And make sure the iron is upright
<GOOD> When you put it down at least
<GOOD> That only happens if you leave the iron on one spot without much steam
<GOOD> But it's your choice dw
<GOOD> I thought hard games were well recieved in Japan
<GOOD> Tbf I'm unsure of the reception to The Lost Levels in Japan so
<GOOD> Don't worry baby he's just a nerd
*After Dark Souls*
Omg hiiii
Beat it chick!!!!!
<GOOD> I'm still waiting to pull the trigger on Pikmin 4
<GOOD> Maybe in a few weeks
<GOOD> I literally just made dinner and it reminded me of Pikmin....
<GOOD> It's my favourite franchise tho :((
<GOOD> That's why I'm waiting a few weeks
<GOOD> I will play Hey Pikmin in the meantime or smth
<GOOD> Or my giant ass emulated library
<GOOD> Idk haven't played it but heard it's ppl's least favourite game
<GOOD> But that's not overly concerning to me tbh
<GOOD> Pikmin is a franchise where you can make a case for every game in the series being the best one
<GOOD> Hey Pikmin is a 2D platformer, imo it's not really comparable to the rest
<GOOD> Because it does not have any mechanics from the originals
<GOOD> Indeed
<GOOD> Breadbug my beloved
<GOOD> Shit, bomb rock! Throw it back Olimar!
Hocotate Freight Captain Olimar:
<GOOD> The entire community is
<GOOD> Someone posted this today and it made me laugh for like 5 minutes
<GOOD> I love Olimar
<GOOD> He's my favourite captain
<GOOD> I still don't understand why ppl hate Louie
<GOOD> I watched the cutscene
<GOOD> But like, ppl act like he killed a man or smth
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> He literally just was hungy
<GOOD> Based!?!?!?
<GOOD> I already know a bit about Pik 4 and 3
<GOOD> And a minute amount about Louie in those games
<GOOD> I can't based on Pik 2
<GOOD> My new favourite Pimin art
<GOOD> I need to find more Pimin artists
<GOOD> Sirehound hoodie
<GOOD> I don't know the context apart from he rides it
<GOOD> I didn't spoil myself I literally just knew
<GOOD> Like it's been months since Pik 4 released, I know the final boss of 3 and 4
<GOOD> Just not much else about them
<GOOD> Can't afford it still
<GOOD> And can't emulate it because Wii U didn't work
<GOOD> I know what it looks like and a tiny bit what it does but not really
<GOOD> Same as the other fella in 3
<GOOD> Oh right its name is plasm wraith
<GOOD> I know what that is oddly enough
<GOOD> Umi Bozo is a yokai that asks for a bucket from seafarers and sinks the boat after
<GOOD> I didn't think the Plasm Wraith could blow up ships tbh
<GOOD> I mean the Goolix isn't really like the wraiths
<GOOD> At least if the Plasm Wraith is similar to Water
<GOOD> Especially since the Water Wraith isn't actually water
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> O also for Pimin 4 I know about Moss and Dandori ofc
<GOOD> I wish I could eat a breadbug rn
<GOOD> Tbf matchat being gone is for the better
<GOOD> Bremdbug yummy
<GOOD> I will eat
<GOOD> Not after that Pik 2 challenge it isn't I hated that one
<GOOD> Have you played that challenge
<GOOD> The one with a bunch of breadbugs and you need to kill them all
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> My lunch made me think of it
<GOOD> I can't afford 4
<GOOD> Also what is 251
<GOOD> That seems fun
<GOOD> I did that by accident
<GOOD> Peppino
<GOOD> My white flatmate just said a racial slur completely casually to another white flatmate
<GOOD> Yeah, at least I like the rest of my flatmates
<GOOD> Those 2 are just awful
<GOOD> Also morning
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> Fellas I cooked a feast for myself
<GOOD> It was so yummy
<GOOD> Feast indeed
<GOOD> I found out that apparently this uni's gaming society is 1/3 trans women
<GOOD> Bad time to enter chat
<GOOD> Also I'm thinking of nicknames rn
<GOOD> I'm so bad at it
<GOOD> I need a nickname for a male Ursaluna and a female Dusclopa
<GOOD> Currently I'm thinking Rusty and Stephanie
<GOOD> Nah normal Ursa
<GOOD> And it has to be kinda unique
<GOOD> Rusty
<GOOD> And Stephanie for Dusclops
<GOOD> Because idk she looks a bit like a Stephanie
<GOOD> Yeah but wb Ursaluna
<GOOD> I might just pick a normal name tbh
<GOOD> It feels more natural, like Stephanie
<GOOD> Idk Mudrick just feels clunky
<GOOD> I'll probably get an idea when I see the mon
<GOOD> I like that one
<GOOD> I'll probably consider it
<GOOD> Being immune to sand immediately makes you a top pick in ADV OU
<GOOD> It wouldn't be running special
<GOOD> It would be spamming head smash
<GOOD> Bounty in gen 3 those are all special
<GOOD> Too bad I will run Regice even if it's not that great
<GOOD> Frfr
<GOOD> Face tanks it probably
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I still think the funniest comp pick possible is RBY OU Porygon
<GOOD> Because if you pick them you do it knowing that it's dead weight unless in 1 specific situation
<GOOD> Guys I want SMW so badly do I buy it instead of Pik 4
<GOOD> I wish Nintendo only released 1 banger a year
<GOOD> Then I wouldn't have to choose
<GOOD> Minun
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> Minun is my favourite electric type
<GOOD> Too much Twitter for today
<GOOD> Frontiers on Switch being better quality than Smash is the kind of take you can't look away from
<GOOD> I like Crawdaunt but don't use it
<GOOD> Guys look at this beautiful scenery
<GOOD> (I'm very funny and original)
<GOOD> I need to actually buy an outfit for halloween
<GOOD> Nothing too serious but my friend invited me to the FNAF movie, she and a friend are going as bonnie and chica
<GOOD> So I am Freddy
<GOOD> AFTON!?
<GOOD> As it turns out Clay was female (good for her) so the girlbosses are beginning their quest
<GOOD> (Clay is Quirky and Stephanie is Quiet)
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> My 2 ribbon master pokemon
<GOOD> Ribbons.guide
<GOOD> Aa many as possible ye
<GOOD> Dusclops is one of the few pokemon that can get the highest amount
<GOOD> That doesn't mean it can't be fully done
<GOOD> True he has the rizz stare
<GOOD> I might rename Stephanie the Duskull to Dudeclops
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's a reference to the most famous female Duskull ever
<GOOD> Dudeskull
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> One of my favourite movies ever is now in FN?
<GOOD> Might play again fr
<GOOD> The girlbosses have gained their first proper ribbon
<GOOD> I can't decide between Pimin 3, Pimin 4 or SM Wonder now
<GOOD> Best Pikmin game is a bold statement
<GOOD> For any of the titles really
<GOOD> I bought them
<GOOD> On Switch
<GOOD> The bundle when it released a few months back
<GOOD> 2
<GOOD> I downloaded the Sonic Mega Collection to emulate eventually
<GOOD> Fun fact I've never beaten sonic 1, 2, 3 or CD
<GOOD> I'm gonna level with you this looks miserable
<GOOD> Does Tails really make that noise every time
<GOOD> That is genuinely insufferable
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> It just feels so extra
<GOOD> Like, EVERY time?
<GOOD> I can understand some times but aaaaa
<GOOD> Yeah ik
<GOOD> But it's still the same noise
<GOOD> I wanna give Mario a pass because he has different noises and it isn't HYA
<GOOD> Oh my fucking god
<GOOD> Why is it so loud too
<GOOD> I love calling everything complaining even when I'm literally just saying wow that's a bit annoying
<GOOD> I mean it's non existent so I guess I wouldn't
<GOOD> Yes if that noise were played in my ear every time I jumped and attacked over multiple hours it would be
<GOOD> It's like if every noise that Link made was his hoyaaaa
<GOOD> Idk why you're acting like this about a random observation but sure
<GOOD> I shouldn't be suprised since it happens every time
<GOOD> I meant for jumping and every slash
<GOOD> I know that he does it often
<GOOD> Link does not hoyaaa on every roll and jump, no?
<GOOD> He makes noises but not like shouting
<GOOD> I thought he made hup noises or whatever
<GOOD> Yeah like Mario Odyssey Mario
<GOOD> He makes loud yahoos sometimes but sometimes just makes weird small noises
<GOOD> Like ground pounding
<GOOD> Yeah the whole roll cancel cap thing is stuck in my head
<GOOD> Hap-hoop-wahoo ha-hoo--wahoo
<GOOD> Goofy ass voicelines
<GOOD> I love Mario
<GOOD> Hahoooagagagagaga
<GOOD> Is a classic
<GOOD> You should hear the one where he opens his gas bill for the month (oh fuck)
<GOOD> ((It was a cut voiceline))
<GOOD> Luigi is my favourite fella
<GOOD> He's so silly
<GOOD> He's like looeegee time
<GOOD> I've only played Dark Moon
<GOOD> Anyway I have no doubt SM Wonder will continue to have even more silly sounds
<GOOD> And I've already beaten Dream Team
<GOOD> Wowie Zowie
<GOOD> I definitely want SM Wonder
<GOOD> It looks so fun
<GOOD> Idk why but the way it's styled is approaching Rayman goofiness
<GOOD> Elephant Mario is peak
<GOOD> Wowie Zowie
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Also I love the choice they made to style the characters like the SM World illustrations
<GOOD> Especially the boos
<GOOD> The game looks so pretty
<GOOD> I mean
<GOOD> There was always something off about Yoshi
<GOOD> This is the art but I could only find this DA image of someone hue shifting it to blue so
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I love how they took from that
<GOOD> Because like they didn't need to make this game quirky
<GOOD> That's probably my cue to sleep on that concept
<GOOD> Man it's been a long day Yoshi horse just broke me
<GOOD> It's 1am
<GOOD> Wowie zowie
<GOOD> Jill sammich
<GOOD> Yeah ik
<GOOD> I love that line
<GOOD> I wish I wanted to play FN so bad
<GOOD> This is one of my favourite movies ever
<GOOD> I want him to crank 90s
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Afaik it isn't
<GOOD> I meant it is
<GOOD> Anyway Jack Skellington is here is Fortnite canon to Kingdom Hearts now
<GOOD> That's my understanding of the lore of KH
<GOOD> Why does Sora wear clown shoes and so many chains
<GOOD> I saw Pik 4 in a supermarket and had to resist the urge to buy it
<GOOD> Almost Wonder time raaaa
<GOOD> Wowie Zowie
<GOOD> It looks so fun oml, I hope Mario's controls are a little diff to usual
<GOOD> Even if slightly tweaked
<GOOD> I do hear that Wonder Mario's jump height is a bit tweaked
<GOOD> Although I think it's lower than usual?
<GOOD> Yeah probably badges
<GOOD> To be fair, Mario's movement has been polished to near perfection in terms of simplicity
<GOOD> It just feels right to control every time
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Chat chat chat, I came out to people irl
<GOOD> Well some
<GOOD> Uh basically one of my flatmates is reaaaaaally shitty with this kinda shit, so I had a chat w a few others and they were allies soooo ya
<GOOD> They were super accepting and promised to keep it a secret
<GOOD> I cried a little bit but that's expected I had it coming
<GOOD> But ye it went well
<GOOD> That's nice of them
<GOOD> Also I may treat myself finally later this month
<GOOD> Buy a game or smth
<GOOD> I will simply tiptoe around hateful people because I'm conflict-avoidant
<GOOD> Rosie lurker
<GOOD> I have choices to make tbh
<GOOD> Either
>tiny enby flag
>Mario Wonder
>Pikmin 4
>Freddy Fazbear onesie to wear to the movie
<GOOD> Did it go ok?
<GOOD> {squeeze} good
<GOOD> One Piece games in general aren't great
<GOOD> True very pretty
<GOOD> Burning Blood is dumb fun so I like that one
<GOOD> Arizza!?!?!?
<GOOD> /j
<GOOD> Wha
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Also the girlbosses are in gen 4
<GOOD> They are beautiful
<GOOD> I can trade locally between my 3DS and DS
<GOOD> I have HGSS cartridge to put on my DS, then I'm injecting Platinum and Diamond into my 3DS
<GOOD> I was planning to keep Dusclops unevolved but like
<GOOD> Dusknoir was one of my favourite pokemon ever
<GOOD> It was my favourite pokemon for lingest
<GOOD> Fun fact before Ledian Dusknoir was my favourite pokemon for about 12 years
<GOOD> I mean Eviolite Dusclops is really really good
<GOOD> It's coming to later gens
<GOOD> These two are going all the way up to gen 9
<GOOD> I rarely get attached to pokemon
<GOOD> But these ribbon masters are the reason
<GOOD> I started em just to be attached to mons
<GOOD> Like look I drew them eeping
<GOOD> Clay is Quirky and Stephanie is Quiet
<GOOD> Absolutely
<GOOD> I love love love Ursaluna
<GOOD> Also I transferred them onto official hardware today
<GOOD> Impetuous?
<GOOD> Impulsive
<GOOD> THEIR GENDER!?!?!?!?
<GOOD> Erm erm why they/them!?!?!?!? You are ONE person!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!?
<GOOD> Holy shit, you can change a log by bolb
<GOOD> The chosen one
<GOOD> Idk why but I am obsessed with the log by bolb shitpost
<GOOD> It's so funny to me
<GOOD> No we have to sit outside
<GOOD> My friends recommended me so many anime
<GOOD> Blue Lock, Mob, Vinland Saga and Samurai Champloo are the big 4 they gave me
<GOOD> I really wanna watch all of them
<GOOD> Hovering
<GOOD> I sit down usually
<GOOD> Because I like sitting down in general
<GOOD> Tbf I had a downside, where it was 6am and I didn't put the seat down and almost fell
<GOOD> Yeah it was funny
<GOOD> I think I'll decide my treat later
<GOOD> Mine calls me a girl too womp womp
<GOOD> Has since I was a kid
<GOOD> I'm buying a tiny NB flag if any
<GOOD> Like from the width of my chest to being able to fit in a pencil holder
<GOOD> Anywhere in that scale
<GOOD> Like this
<GOOD> So apparently the new Mario VA voiced Otis in the Barnyard video game
<GOOD> Prestigious career
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Moooooore Pimin
<GOOD> 1 week to go
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> The Princess Peach thing is ass
<GOOD> But oh well all those Mario designs are gas
<GOOD> Le pokemon cycle
<GOOD> I like Corruption
<GOOD> Oh Magnus Carlsen is accusing people of cheating again
<GOOD> Mf lost both rounds and then decided to tweet about cheating after he lost instead
<GOOD> His opponent was wearing a watch
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Magnus Carlsen is the Chess player
<GOOD> And therefore is very whiny and likes pretending his opponents cheat when he loses
<GOOD> As soon as I saw my opponent wearing a watch, I lost my ability to concentrate
<GOOD> Then why didn't he call it out at all and ask about it
<GOOD> And if he isn't accusing them, why would he immediately talk about anti cheating measures
<GOOD> I literally saw the tweet, I did fact check as much as is possible because of primary evidence directly from the dude
<GOOD> So..... why didn't he
<GOOD> He noticed it early in the game
<GOOD> Concealing things like buzzers to signal moves
<GOOD> I can't find the footage but it was analog (and apparently banned?)
<GOOD> Though that feels like it would be enforced if it were true
<GOOD> Also I'm not suggesting anyone is cheating, but my opponent was wearing a watch and it threw me off a lot and you should enforce anti cheating better is heavily implied despite not stating
<GOOD> Then why complain after
<GOOD> Like if he respected the dude that much maybe he could have just asked him to take the watch off
<GOOD> Instead of waiting till he lost to imply he was cheating
<GOOD> That's fair
<GOOD> I understand his point about watches I just think he approached it in the worst way possible
<GOOD> It makes him come off as a sore loser especially considering having similar issues before
<GOOD> I do feel in this case he would be justified to ask before but just lose gracefully after
<GOOD> For whatever reason I first off got the impression that he was distracted by the watch ticking and was like goddamn that loud?
<GOOD> Bro got the grandfather watch
<GOOD> Yeah I know now
<GOOD> It's just a funny idea that the dude had an obscenely loud watch
<GOOD> It just feels like, he's Magnus Carlsen yk
<GOOD> He should know the deal
<GOOD> I didn't even realise the mf voice acting Po in the series wasn't Jack Black
<GOOD> The !?!?!?!?!?!? Is sending me
<GOOD> Scrolling through his Twitter tho does Magnus actually have an ego or is it just a personality he puts on
<GOOD> I thought Gothamchess also popularised it
<GOOD> And the uptick of general knowledge of chess and shit on social media (which includes Hikaru)
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Stuff like this
<GOOD> I got back into chess from anarchychess posting lmao
<GOOD> (I still know basically nothing except how to play)
<GOOD> Oh don't get me wrong it's goofy
<GOOD> I'm eepy
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> More progress raaaaa
<GOOD> Definitely gonna be in every review
<GOOD> I wish
<GOOD> Is that the predownload
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> I still haven't decided between Pik 3, 4, Wonder or Freddy Fazbear onesie
<GOOD> I don't have a voucher
<GOOD> It's just 1 of those items
<GOOD> Probably yeah
<GOOD> I have to do such a big shop tomorrow
<GOOD> I think I'm physically incapable of treating myself to anything above 2
<GOOD> I don't drink
<GOOD> Yeah I just drink water
<GOOD> I don't have any but I do have these flavoured tablet things
<GOOD> Same concept but I think they have vitamins
<GOOD> It basically just makes it taste nice
<GOOD> And says it contains magnesium and electrolytes but like, I don't work out apart from walking and hauling shopping so
<GOOD> Looks nice
<GOOD> I should look around
<GOOD> This is the thing my mom gave me
<GOOD> No idea
<GOOD> They are but it's strange how they're hydrating, ik it makes sense but like
<GOOD> It sounds like those pseudoscience products lol
<GOOD> It's luckily everywhere here
<GOOD> You can go into a store and just buy blackcurrant squash
<GOOD> I thought it was just a climate thing
<GOOD> Or a general appeal thing
<GOOD> I wanna buy one of these tbh
<GOOD> I looooove grape stuff
<GOOD> I wonder what the imported price spike would be for robinson's squash
<GOOD> I basically only have blackcurrant in juice
<GOOD> I would die if grapes were regulated like that
<GOOD> That's such a bizarre concept
<GOOD> At least to me
<GOOD> I can't wrap my head around the concept of blackurrants just not being there
<GOOD> It's not even like I have them often
<GOOD> Pharaoh's Curse
<GOOD> Jesus
<GOOD> What are those growths
<GOOD> Is it a fungi?
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> I just crunched a few numbers on how much I spend
<GOOD> I can't tell whether I'm meant to be patting myself on the back or telling myself to treat myself more
<GOOD> My friend thinks I am a psychopath now
<GOOD> 6 days
<GOOD> There gender
<GOOD> Apparently the FNAF movie director went on a talk show yesterday and the host called it Friday Nights at Freddy's
<GOOD> I love bear movie raaa
<GOOD> My friend has invited me and told me they're cosplaying as Bonnie
<GOOD> I forgot to get milk yesterday so my breakfast was un-milked corn flakes
<GOOD> Also I may pick Frye for the first time ever
<GOOD> I am all skeleton
<GOOD> I like zero build
<GOOD> Drip
<GOOD> You have to go through  first
<GOOD> Read the pins for the requirements
<GOOD> You sent a message there 7 minutes ago
<GOOD> Can you not see it now?
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I'm probably preordering SM Wonder soon raaaaaa
<GOOD> My friend said it was amazing
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> I started my affirmation book raaaaaa
<GOOD> Therapy thing, basically just a book of good qualities I constantly have to add to
<GOOD> It's fine
<GOOD> My issue is obviously digging up good qualities so
<GOOD> Kinda the point of the book
<GOOD> You start with nothing then occasionally you're like hey wait I'm good at that and write it down before your brain smooshes it
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> My therapist didn't give me the book
<GOOD> They gave me a pdf that said it might be a good idea
<GOOD> So ig I just keep this with me now
<GOOD> I'm fortunately the master of oversharing so even tho my therapist was just kinda nice I immediately answered every question she asked {ConcernedPoliwhirl}
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I should probably buy MC on PC
<GOOD> I'm trying to last a few more days to buy Mario Wonder
<GOOD> Oh it won?
<GOOD> Sick
<GOOD> I wanted crab too but armadillo is cute
<GOOD> Yeah ik I just wanna last a few days before splurging
<GOOD> Hobnobs
<GOOD> I'd also recommend the viennese whirls
<GOOD> Fruit pastilles are nice but they're what I imagine american sweets are like anyway
<GOOD> Top right 2nd image
<GOOD> They look different to the ones I have but same concept
<GOOD> They're p nice
<GOOD> These are like the gems except squishier and dusted(?) With sugar
<GOOD> They're really nice (the black ones are best)
<GOOD> I have also heard Ambrosia is ok but I don't eat custard
<GOOD> Viennese whirls and hobnobs are heavenly
<GOOD> Esp hobnobs, they can be eaten alone or dunked into hot drinks
<GOOD> And it's not like they fall apart easily cuz they're oaty
<GOOD> Very dense
<GOOD> Iced coffee eh
<GOOD> I dunk hobnobs in my latte daily tho
<GOOD> It's just the meltiness
<GOOD> Told you
<GOOD> They work in any situation
<GOOD> Hai Obie
<GOOD> It's hobnob time
<GOOD> I wish I liked jam
<GOOD> Also those are similar ye
<GOOD> Viennese whirls are very yummy too but like, Hobnobs are universal
<GOOD> I have a massive sweet tooth so
<GOOD> I know a lot about UK sweets
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> At some point absolutely
<GOOD> I will admit, the other day I bought a bag for across a few days and literally just scranned the entire thing
<GOOD> Because they're nice af
<GOOD> Uh they're like, actual jelly in the middle
<GOOD> It's weird
<GOOD> And covered in powdered sugar
<GOOD> Absolute heaven
<GOOD> Ik I'm saying that about all of them but whatever
<GOOD> UK sweets are lovely
<GOOD> Tbf if I couldn't have gelatin it would just be hobnobs and maltesers or smth
<GOOD> I don't get the hype
<GOOD> Yeah they're just ok
<GOOD> Beware of UK snacks tho
<GOOD> It's terrifying how fast you can just eat all of them
<GOOD> I don't think I've ever gotten like actually full off British snacks no matter how much is eaten
<GOOD> The snacks have MSG too?
<GOOD> I thought it was for savoury food
<GOOD> Speaking of MSG I'm getting a chinese tomorrow
<GOOD> 8 for salt and pepper chicken and some chips/rice
<GOOD> Isn't the question without
<GOOD> Marshmallows have gelatin in general, it's how they retain their form ig
<GOOD> Yeah probably lmao
<GOOD> Never said Hobnobs are good for you
<GOOD> They're addictive tho
<GOOD> I limit myself to 3 a day
<GOOD> You can get them without
<GOOD> They're still decent
<GOOD> You haven't tried them
<GOOD> Those that believe Hobnobs are carried by the chocolate simply don't understand the oaty strength
<GOOD> The chocolate is a compliment smh
<GOOD> I happen to know a lot about tea and biscuits myself
<GOOD> Are those the chalky ones
<GOOD> Both of those are sick
<GOOD> I love the giant parma violets too
<GOOD> Parma violets are what you wish chalk tasted like
<GOOD> Idk wall insulation feels like a thing you have not eaten
<GOOD> Just hazarding a guess
<GOOD> Yeah and then you'll get your hands on some glass fibres lmao
<GOOD> So will your trachea
<GOOD> Eaten eaten or licked eaten
<GOOD> I once compared tastes between BotW and Mario Odyssey cartridges
<GOOD> Odyssey tasted marginally better
<GOOD> God forbid women have hobbies smhsmh
<GOOD> I would scran human flesh if given the chance tbh
<GOOD> If you cooked it right or you could get Humanella or some shit
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> THREE QUID FOR THAT!?
<GOOD> I'm supporting Gangwon FC
<GOOD> Different recipe and fairly sure the food came first
<GOOD> Fairly sure it is yeah, since the slur has probably existed for ~100 years as a ballpark
<GOOD> I won't pretend to know I knoe about it though
<GOOD> To be fair that looks heavenly for the price
<GOOD> Also that isn't Japan is it
<GOOD> O wait nvm
<GOOD> I was thinking of the previous post
<GOOD> That took longer than it should
<GOOD> Anyway I buy Wonder tomorrow
<GOOD> Wowie Zowie
<GOOD> I just used my entire afternoon lmao
<GOOD> It didn't go to waste
<GOOD> I'm going for skeleton
<GOOD> Ordering my first takeout since I got here raaaa
<GOOD> 8 for egg fried rice and some salt and pepper chicken ain't bad tbh
<GOOD> At least by Chinese standards
<GOOD> Cool hair
<GOOD> I dig the bloo
<GOOD> They gave me the chinese in plastic tubs
<GOOD> That means free plastic tubs ig
<GOOD> Drip
<GOOD> Watched funny web clown show
<GOOD> Pretty good
<GOOD> It was sent twice
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> Less neat
<GOOD> Superstars released at the *Kong* time, raaaaaaa
<GOOD> I think I bruised my foot
<GOOD> This may end up being one of my worst tilts at a game ever
<GOOD> I just kicked and punched a wooden desk barefoot
<GOOD> And screamed into my hands
<GOOD> But like I threw my foot straight up into the underside of the desk so it hit across my entire foot
<GOOD> I haven't been this mad at a game in a long ass while
<GOOD> Pokemon
<GOOD> Doing battle tower, it's probably the least fun experience I've had in a while and I had a breakdown a few weeks ago
<GOOD> Genuinely ends up ruining my day
<GOOD> My eyes hurt
<GOOD> Yeah you should buy the game
<GOOD> New web series
<GOOD> People are losing their shit over an 8 it's pathetic
<GOOD> Like jesus christ
<GOOD> Erm, MY spiderman!?!?!?!?!??!?!?
<GOOD> Oh idc about the game, I'm saying that it's ridiculous how ridiculous the overreaction is to having a single 8/10 review
<GOOD> True I love the goobers, I have never used Tumblr but I imagine these fellas are what Tumblr people like
<GOOD> I've never seen anything from them up until now
<GOOD> I saw Murder Drones from Glitch before tho that was alr
<GOOD> I like how it gives them a platform
<GOOD> I mean yeah Caine is pretty menacing tbh
<GOOD> I like his design but still
<GOOD> Very unsettling sometimes
<GOOD> Anyway Pomni made me watch it
<GOOD> Jester characters are certain to make my brain go ooga booga
<GOOD> The extra acceleration as he leaves the window looks like that Dr Strange gif
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That feels 
Too ahort
<GOOD> Short
<GOOD> If they're equally spaced
<GOOD> Yeah ik it's the classic sonic experience etc
<GOOD> Just thought there would be more
<GOOD> Yeah so hopefully it's like that
<GOOD> And not equally spaced emeralds
<GOOD> They're settling around 7s and 8s
<GOOD> Which seems fair
<GOOD> Tbf I basically never give anything a 10
<GOOD> 10s are too generous usually
<GOOD> Anyway here's hoping I give Wonder a 9 at least
<GOOD> It is gonna be so silly goofy
<GOOD> Mario will go wowie zowie
<GOOD> I'm gonna pop off
<GOOD> I love how this game looks so
<GOOD> Probably preordering ig today or tomorrow
<GOOD> I've saved my money for months to buy it
<GOOD> I mean yeah
<GOOD> It looks great
<GOOD> Apparently it was made in the Splat 3 and TotK engine too so
<GOOD> Hm?
<GOOD> No it's just the engine
<GOOD> They apparently got a ton of new hires and shit to suggest a bunch of crazy ideas for the game actually
<GOOD> That seems to be the case so far
<GOOD> I hope Mario's movement is tweaked a little compared to NSMB
<GOOD> I meant at a base, like tweaking jump height, speed, etc
<GOOD> I'd just like a tiny change of pace
<GOOD> It's not necessary but appreciated if they do
<GOOD> The mods about to go crazy
<GOOD> I never bought Celeste tbh I didn't get the hype as much for some reason
<GOOD> I do want Tropical Freeze tho because you get to play as a gorilla
<GOOD> The trans community will send wolves with blue fur and pronouns after you Gwen
<GOOD> Cba to cook today tbh
<GOOD> Also the models leaked
<GOOD> Some dude just held the door for me only to release it at the worst possible time to hit me
<GOOD> Guys Nintendo has FORGOTTEN about Mario...
<GOOD> I'm going to strange Prosafia if he spoils this one for me
<GOOD> Already?
<GOOD> Well as long as it was fun
<GOOD> Marcel
<GOOD> The hyperfixation has infested my lecture doodling
<GOOD> Raaaaa
<GOOD> I should really stop with these
<GOOD> Biscuits and hot chocolate
<GOOD> Yeah but I might get fat
<GOOD> So I'm gonna not drink it as often
<GOOD> I am just barely underweight
<GOOD> I drinked it all
<GOOD> 2 days
<GOOD> Raaa
<GOOD> I wonder what he's selling
<GOOD> Oh nvm
<GOOD> Answered itself before I even asked
<GOOD> Ok tbf that sounds badass I want one
<GOOD> It feels like therapy but with added escapism
<GOOD> What the fuck is the Minor community
<GOOD> I've recently gained a massive interest in just watching Melee
<GOOD> I root for and watch the single Yoshi player because they're cracked
<GOOD> I have no idea how people follow or even react to what's happening tbh
<GOOD> Well my ribbon quest is paused for now
<GOOD> I need to wait for my mom to mail an SD USB converter
<GOOD> So I can inject Diamond
<GOOD> Oof pricey shop today
<GOOD> I splurged and spent extra money on some chamomile tea
<GOOD> I like it :((
<GOOD> It's for when I get angry
<GOOD> I spent about 15 on this shop
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> I was 10 then
<GOOD> Spiderman fans apparently
<GOOD> Valid score
<GOOD> Expected tbh
<GOOD> Goty means nothing at this point
<GOOD> Truuuue
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I thought Latino people despised being called Latinx
<GOOD> At least in my experience
<GOOD> Best I know is a genderfluid hispanic person
<GOOD> (And a general history of having quite literally no one I've met on the internet like the phrase to the point Bungee was getting lambasted on community notes for even saying it )
<GOOD> That sounds awful
<GOOD> They didn't tho they just included it and people didn't like it
<GOOD> At least afaik
<GOOD> I don't understand how this is related
<GOOD> I don't call my Hispanic friend Latina/o/e, I call them Hispanic when it comes up
<GOOD> Roast beef?
<GOOD> Yes we do
<GOOD> I have 1 American bloke and an Italian girl in my flat
<GOOD> I'm on neutral terms w the american dude and am friends w the italian girl
<GOOD> ~~and hate the bloke from Liverpool~~
<GOOD> My closest friend is a girl from Lancaster she's epic
<GOOD> Oki enough portal 2 for today
<GOOD> My flatmates keep like, plundering flatmates from other flats in this building lmao
<GOOD> Rn there are 11 people here
<GOOD> I'm only like, super close w the Lancaster girl and she isn't from my flat
<GOOD> I'm friends with all but 1 of my flatmates tho which is good
<GOOD> And I'm the least objectionable of them
<GOOD> I don't like it
<GOOD> Made a cup of chamomile
<GOOD> I prefer jackets but I'm sure it tasted lovely
<GOOD> I had wings, wedges and some pork lmao
<GOOD> I had to get rid of the pork strip today but it wasn't enough for a tea so
<GOOD> I've only missed 1 meal so far
<GOOD> Because my stupid ass brain never ever ever shuts up
<GOOD> My brain always causes a strict schedule
<GOOD> Holy shit Jimmy Saul Goodman
<GOOD> Also I have an issue
<GOOD> I can't take this teabag out of my cup
<GOOD> Nvm I burned my finger but it's out
<GOOD> I just have a teabag
<GOOD> This is chamomile
<GOOD> I splurged
<GOOD> Holy shit True Man's World *and* herbal tea!?!?!?
<GOOD> No lie my first thoughts about being enby came from Splatoon
<GOOD> And it makes me sound fucking stupid
<GOOD> Idk I was kinda like look at these mostly enby little fuckers they're so epic I wish I didn't have to have a gender that would be awesome and it planted seeds in my head to actually have me question
<GOOD> Well I'm not agender
<GOOD> But like you get the gist
<GOOD> But I hate saying that because it just sounds like I'm attention seeking and being enby because a franchise I like has enby characters
<GOOD> I'm a tiny bit more comfortable
<GOOD> My transition just feels a lot more crude than what other ppl describe
<GOOD> Like I literally just went do I want to even bother with gender? And then a bit later I was like yeah fuck it I want to be enby I think that's what I am
<GOOD> And it worked so
<GOOD> People get so heated when mfs wear women's clothing that are basically unisex
<GOOD> It's crazy
<GOOD> Oh right I have therapy next week
<GOOD> Hey that's the 1 flatmate I dislike
<GOOD> How long did it last
<GOOD> (I came out to half my flat a week ago and the other half is probably never gonna know)
<GOOD> It's genuinely hard to listen to the cishet white Catholic dude tell people his pronouns are 2 slurs and I'd rather avoid conflict womp womp
<GOOD> So hopefully that person never finds out and I can just exist frfr
<GOOD> I'd rather keep my head down in my case but respect
<GOOD> Living with the person is just too much hassle to start getting heated over
<GOOD> There are 6 people here that are trans supportive, 1 that is neutral (downplaying and saying trans ppl do it for attention but still respects pronouns) and then this dude
<GOOD> But other than when he randomly rants the other people find him agreeable and I'm never in the same room as him so
<GOOD> Well transphobic views but some form of mutual respect
<GOOD> I don't know man they're one of the mfs I speak to least too
<GOOD> Pisses me off a bit but not as much as the openly ranting person
<GOOD> Since they yk, keep that shit to themselves
<GOOD> And I meant neutral as in my ability to be within a 20 foot proximity of them without being annoyed
<GOOD> I assume it would just be like, base understanding and respect
<GOOD> Too tired to harbour resentment over people I have to exist around every day
<GOOD> Already did that for a few years, bringing it to uni isn't gonna help me much
<GOOD> Path of least resistance raaaagh
<GOOD> Nah it's absolutely shitty of me
<GOOD> I just don't care because it's bad for my health to argue
<GOOD> Like this is someone I would have to actively argue with and resent every day for years
<GOOD> And I just don't care enough to do that
<GOOD> Saving my energy for a nemesis ong
<GOOD> As I said I already quietly simmered and got mad at people internally at home
<GOOD> The only thing I'd spend energy on is trying to change their view tbh, and I'd optimistically say it's probably possible with that person but I'm doubtful enough to not bother
<GOOD> Eh, stranger things have happened
<GOOD> As I said being optimistic people can be redeemed or convinced to see different views
<GOOD> Have heard of it happening before and would like to believe that's how the world works sometimes
<GOOD> I just hold the incredibly naive belief that civil conversations can lead to a lot of good things
<GOOD> I mean that's why I leave the idiotic screaming man alone
<GOOD> Eh maybe eventually it may be worth my effort to at least broaden their worldview a bit more
<GOOD> Even if it doesn't change them completely, I'd never expect it to
<GOOD> Mm that's my issue
<GOOD> I doubt I'll end up doing it but it's a nice thought to have
<GOOD> My flatmate has actually talked to the person about it before as a discussion and they left on civil terms since it was casual so
<GOOD> I appreciate them being here since they never fail to call ppl out on bullshit
<GOOD> Point being that the person wasn't dismissive of that view and therefore I do think that they can understand it in time
<GOOD> Mm They're chill enough
<GOOD> So for now living and letting live is also a nice option
<GOOD> Fellas a new scary thought appeared in my brain
<GOOD> I should try playing Melee
<GOOD> Eventually I have to be good at a game
<GOOD> Minecraft sucks to get good at tbh
<GOOD> Or at least it seems like it
<GOOD> But what if I wanted to play Roy
<GOOD> Also I'm literally not good at a single game rn
<GOOD> aMSa is genuinely the reason I watch competitive Melee
<GOOD> His Yoshi is so fun to watch
<GOOD> Yeah he won a super-national(?)
<GOOD> Or something like that
<GOOD> Basically a huge event
<GOOD> He's also beaten Hbox's puff which is a flex in itself
<GOOD> I'm not a roy fan he just looks cool
<GOOD> I should play Marth then fr
<GOOD> I main Inkling rn
<GOOD> But idk whether I wanna keep playing em
<GOOD> Eventually I wanna learn Olimar
<GOOD> Ew
<GOOD> Every Link must stay away from me
<GOOD> I might go back to Wario
<GOOD> I just wanna play Olimar because he's the representative of my favourite game franchise and my favourite game protag
<GOOD> Also if I played Melee I'd probably play something really fucking weird but still viable like Doc
<GOOD> Ideally I'd play Game n Watch but that mf is too weird
<GOOD> Like what were they thinking
<GOOD> He's so odd
<GOOD> Based
<GOOD> Also does Melee actually have a definitive community tier list
<GOOD> I would probably play Luigi or smth tbh
<GOOD> Or Fox I like Fox
<GOOD> Poor Bowser
<GOOD> What time can I play Wonder btw
<GOOD> Is it just like, midnight my time
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> It's all predownloaded yippee
<GOOD> Is this about the flowers
<GOOD> What sounds are overwhelming tho
<GOOD> Afaik most of the noises are similar to NSMB
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Marauders are fine when there's 1 or even 2
<GOOD> Just not too many
<GOOD> Them being counterintuitive is kinda the point, they box you in for groups of demons to focus you
<GOOD> Breaking up your flow is an easy way to make the game hard
<GOOD> Idk I never have an issue since I just pick everything else off first
<GOOD> I mean in Doom Eternal if you can't flow it becomes hard
<GOOD> If you can then you snowball out of control which leads to ripping and tearing, and it's your job to keep it
<GOOD> It's like a rhythm game doing a switchup, it feels bad but it's not really the game's fault you didn't keep it going
<GOOD> Doom Eternal is all about flow and rhythm
<GOOD> It does apply
<GOOD> Dude this enemy is not comparable to that lmao
<GOOD> Depends on the switch up
<GOOD> Ehhh there isn't really a Rhythm Heaven game that correlates to this, at least not one that comes to mind
<GOOD> Closest for me is probably the coin flip minigame
<GOOD> Oh or the fillbots one where they change the music
<GOOD> That one really throws you off
<GOOD> I mean if it had less health it would have been a pretty ass boss
<GOOD> Like I'm not gonna complain about the cyber-mancubus having too much health because if I don't kill it it's a me problem
<GOOD> Why is it not a problem
<GOOD> The Marauder making you think differently about how you deal with it isn't really bad
<GOOD> Not like it shows up all that often either
<GOOD> Then why is it throwing you off
<GOOD> Also it absolutely makes you play different by encouraging medium spacing
<GOOD> Which is something that iirc no other demon demands
<GOOD> Wario(?)
<GOOD> Or Inkling
<GOOD> Well it also encourages things like leaving it last
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> It encourages a different approach
<GOOD> Hell my strategy basically just involves doing the area while kiting it
<GOOD> And getting in potshots as it gets close
<GOOD> Being able to wipe it easily just feels not right for it
<GOOD> I mean reduced health means the Super Shotgun quickswap probably kills it
<GOOD> But how much
<GOOD> Would taking away 1 quickswap cycle change that much for it
<GOOD> The original thing Skarm said was taking issue with the distance you have to be from the Marauder anyway
<GOOD> A health tweak just means you have to fight it for less time
<GOOD> I mean you said I don't like this enemy and then the context you gave was the spacing
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> Is that the issue with it
<GOOD> Then what makes it go against how Eternal is supposed to go and suck
<GOOD> You never have to tho
<GOOD> Break it up into singular shots
<GOOD> If you're sticking to 1 distance and focusing it down, sure you have to
<GOOD> But if you deal with it by being opportunistic while killing everything else then you never have to
<GOOD> Idk how many Marauder cycles it takes to kill it but making it 1 less reduces the time you stick to it by like 2 seconds
<GOOD> Which I doubt actually changes anything
<GOOD> I have played Eternal
<GOOD> I thought you didn't want that
<GOOD> You didn't want it to be killed immediately
<GOOD> While I was talking about quickswap cycles
<GOOD> Like yeah if it died immediately of course you wouldn't have an issue
<GOOD> But that's not really the point of it
<GOOD> It's not a fodder enemy so it dying immediately isn't really it
<GOOD> (Also the most annoying enemy is still the turret idc)
<GOOD> I mean I never bothered hot swapping in Eternal
<GOOD> I just didn't have an issue with the Marauders at all
<GOOD> Their biggest issue is probably the dogs they can summon tbh
<GOOD> I just don't like the fact that if your reticle is on them too long they also vanish
<GOOD> I only played part q
<GOOD> 1
<GOOD> Live turret reaction
<GOOD> Me and my friend are making a new OC for me rn
<GOOD> Very androgynous, stretchy limbs, blend between a jester and a circus performer for outfits
<GOOD> Oh and their face has those rubber cartoon eyes
<GOOD> Shush
<GOOD> I had a hyperfixation on jesters before even Jevil was a thing
<GOOD> Also tbf the circus performer part is based on a contortionist
<GOOD> New sick web series
<GOOD> Except we had the design of the leotards instead just being the design of their skin
<GOOD> Honestly ended up looking a bit more like Clyde than Pomni
<GOOD> (Clyde is my favourite OC ever tho so)
<GOOD> Wish I had one like that fr
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Ironically enough my interest in jesters triggered me to watch it in the first place not the other way round
<GOOD> Like the OC in my pfp literally is wearing a ringmaster hat I love the circus
<GOOD> I love Pastra
<GOOD> He's so positive
<GOOD> His new vid releases soon too
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> He makes video essays on horror media
<GOOD> Pretty much always positive
<GOOD> Lankmann is a men kisser confirmed
<GOOD> Gum kissing
<GOOD> I don't think Pastra is ignorant of the issues to Bendy 1
<GOOD> He just likes it anyway
<GOOD> He even talks about that in his Dark Revival review
<GOOD> Dude he likes base Security Breach he has a lot more you can find funny
<GOOD> He's just such a ball of positivity I love Pastra
<GOOD> Ok tbf Hello Neighbour REALLY deserves it
<GOOD> And when he did go on that rant he got Phisnom to do most of it for him ~~since that dude is a miserable bastard~~
<GOOD> Batim doesn't have many achievements
<GOOD> I meant ones that aren't just complete this
<GOOD> It definitely is
<GOOD> Probably the hardest of them
<GOOD> Yeah like
<GOOD> Most od the achievements are like that
<GOOD> Fell asleep
<GOOD> The items are the first objective in the game
<GOOD> Yrs
<GOOD> Is it a bad game
<GOOD> Or just hard to 100%
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Also does anyone know how switch digital preorders work
<GOOD> Just making sure I don't stay up for nothing
<GOOD> Good
<GOOD> That looks cool
<GOOD> I remember Viscera Cleanup Detail more than Power Wash tbh
<GOOD> I walked into my flat's kitchen barefoot to make hot chocolate and my flatmates were talking behind my back about me being barefoot when I left
<GOOD> I'm so confused
<GOOD> Is it that big a deal I forgot to put socks on to go make a drink to take back to my room
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Mario Wonder day
<GOOD> This game is so epic
<GOOD> DARK Cassie
<GOOD> Just a dark, fucked up version
<GOOD> A glimpse into my twisted reality
<GOOD> I mean Dark is an archetype of animatronic
<GOOD> It's just that it only appears once for 1 animatronic
<GOOD> Dark springtrap
<GOOD> They are officially a different version of Springtrap despite appearing for like a split second
<GOOD> Iirc it's the SL Custom Night cutscene
<GOOD> Our best look at him is literally from a funko pop lmao
<GOOD> Wowie Zowie
<GOOD> I have a few FNAF funko pops at home
<GOOD> Also I left my cool Foxy bookmark with a message from my mom at home
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I'm still not over the fact that Up has blood in it tbh
<GOOD> Like, Carl just hits some dude over the head with a metal walking stick lmao
<GOOD> So Retro...
<GOOD> Those are cool as fuck
<GOOD> I'm gonna explode
<GOOD> I feel shitty making a jester based OC while this trend is big lmao
<GOOD> Even if I wanted to make a jester OC before
<GOOD> They look like what I imagine a Hazbin Hotel character looks like
<GOOD> Nah they have a more bendy-esque rubberhose face
<GOOD> As they are primarily inspired by rubberhose (and jesters)
<GOOD> Only thing I've seen is a lack of collision on some things rn and how stunning and fast it looks
<GOOD> Plus people making fun of fast travel for some reason (it's crazy you can travel that fast)
<GOOD> And if you wanna go somewhere fast you can now do so
<GOOD> I don't get clowning on people for wanting to, just like, be happy the movement is awesome
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Glad it's fine then
<GOOD> I've seen an insane amount idk why
<GOOD> That game was cool
<GOOD> Also holy shit Mario Wonder is fun af
<GOOD> The online is sick
<GOOD> Already had a bunch of silly interactions with people I love it
<GOOD> I have chosen to play Blue Toad
<GOOD> No, look how long it takes to select them
<GOOD> I hope there is a secret character tbh
<GOOD> That would be neat
<GOOD> I meant wonder lol
<GOOD> I was making a reference
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Wonder is one of the best 2D mario games I've played so far
<GOOD> I kinda gave up on Arch tempered when I realised they weren't fun
<GOOD> I did AT Kush and stopped playing MH for multiple years after
<GOOD> Ngl
<GOOD> Uragaan in GU is kinda annoying
<GOOD> Hammer bounces so much
<GOOD> I genuinely think wasting my time is the worst possible thing a game can do
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> Wonder is really weird
<GOOD> Oh my god this game is so fum
<GOOD> Fun
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It's so fun
<GOOD> Wonder is officially my favourite 2D mario
<GOOD> It's like every level is that one painting level in NSMBU that people raved about
<GOOD> Hard agree
<GOOD> Am in the final area rn
<GOOD> Final boss beat
<GOOD> Best 2D Mario final boss maybe, if not a bit easy
<GOOD> I have yes
<GOOD> It was really good and I do not regret it
<GOOD> And I will 100% it
<GOOD> I actually did
<GOOD> I did most of the levels
<GOOD> Bob Burger
<GOOD> I just beat the story like 10 minutes ago
<GOOD> Didn't dislike a single level I've played so far
<GOOD> At least I have a new favourite 2D Mario now
<GOOD> I mean the designs for stuff like Goombas and Yoshi were straight from SMW Illustrations
<GOOD> What the fuck is that one at the bottom
<GOOD> Pisexual?
<GOOD> I've never seen that flag
<GOOD> Also that one w the black triangle and the purple line is S tier imo
<GOOD> It's very clean
<GOOD> Gay gay homosexual gay
<GOOD> I like the pink green blue one
<GOOD> Venom controller raaaagh
<GOOD> Also oh my fucking god the music in this game
<GOOD> The entire game reminds me more of the modern Rayman titles than Mario lol
<GOOD> Knocked down from 10 to a 6 because look how long it takes to select Light Blue Yoshi
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I wish
<GOOD> Wdym by flag
<GOOD> Oh I have no clue how that works
<GOOD> ||I think it's shared||
<GOOD> Actually yes it is
<GOOD> Shared
<GOOD> The only one I actually completed was Zorah and even that wasn't great
<GOOD> I solo'd Zorah lmaooo
<GOOD> It was so frantic
<GOOD> Was literally just sprinting from Zorah to cannons to Zorah to Dragonator to Zorah
<GOOD> Iirc I was 2 minutes out from timing out
<GOOD> Normal lol
<GOOD> You can even kill it sometimes I think
<GOOD> Idk if Nergi is based off timer or health when you repel it
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> My flatmate just randomly walked in and gave me a free diffuser
<GOOD> It's white tea and musk scented
<GOOD> I have no idea
<GOOD> It's a room diffuser not a perfume, so I assume it's just a random added fresh scent
<GOOD> Mmm burning lithium
<GOOD> Also Spoon
<GOOD> My mom just sent me this SS (she orders amazon stuff for me cuz it's her account)
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I don't think deer nuts are the only possible musk
<GOOD> Go
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> They stretchy
<GOOD> My friend invited me to watch w them so I'm dressing to impress
<GOOD> For just completion?
<GOOD> Lemme check
<GOOD> ||8 but it's more like 9||
<GOOD> ||no, the inside of Bowser is a world in itself but it's counted under a different world, which gives it an insane amount of levels||
<GOOD> It varies from decently easy to challenging but not bullshit
<GOOD> Like there are some short levels where failing usually just means you die, but it's short and it's just timing your jumps so
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> The 5 stars aren't bullshit tho
<GOOD> They're just like, Hard/Expert Mario Maker tier levels
<GOOD> I think that's fine tbh
<GOOD> If you wanna get them all in 1 run you can just collect them again anyway
<GOOD> Like I said you can if you want to
<GOOD> Also dipper what is your favorite wonder effect so far
<GOOD> Probably my favourite level in the game
<GOOD> Actually my favourite is ||the 2nd pirahna plant one in special world|| this one will probably spoil you dipper I don't recommend pressing it
<GOOD> One change I haven't seen talked about enough is the addition of ||crouch walking||
<GOOD> The ||challenge badges|| are really cool
<GOOD> Well that's not what they're called
<GOOD> But like it's what they are
<GOOD> Jealous
<GOOD> I'm not buying anything till like Christmas after Wonder
<GOOD> Hopefully my local gaming society buys it
<GOOD> I might buy Pikmin 4 at Christmas
<GOOD> That's it really
<GOOD> Persona ew
<GOOD> The circle of streamers I follow are very funny
<GOOD> I didn't know Wolfey would follow doug
<GOOD> I have now almost 100'd half the worlds
<GOOD> Elephant is my favourite
<GOOD> I love the online co cop man
<GOOD> It's so wholesome
<GOOD> Also soon imma have to start grinding purple coins rip
<GOOD> I'm playing blue toad
<GOOD> So Retro
<GOOD> I am 1 purple coin off completing Wonder
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I have a lot of pent up anger I'm converting into productivity
<GOOD> Nah it has a lot of shit
<GOOD> I got it
<GOOD> Game is 100%'d and without a doubt my favourite 2D Mario
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> I had another day off and a lot of stress to let out
<GOOD> Here's heavy spoilers of what a completed save looks like in Wonder
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> Pikmin 5
<GOOD> RPG remake
<GOOD> Princess Peach looks cool at least
<GOOD> Then just google the list and look
<GOOD> Oh right Mario vs DK
<GOOD> Weren't they gassing up banban 6 tho
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Rosiiie
<GOOD> I had a super duper rough day yesterday but I feel better now
<GOOD> Yeah my body doesn't feel weird anymore
<GOOD> ~~I didn't expect panic attacks to be as scary as it was~~
<GOOD> It's uh
<GOOD> Really Really bad I almost fainted x_x
<GOOD> And it took me a minute or two to even walk back from the kitchen to my bed because I was too shaky
<GOOD> Womp womp
<GOOD> At least you haven't had a full one, that's good maybe
<GOOD> Tru
<GOOD> Mm
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> At least it's only once
<GOOD> When I tried I started gagging x_x
<GOOD> But I'll try a bit harder next time
<GOOD> Though it'll probably be a few years at least until it happens again
<GOOD> ~~I gotta make a new best friend before that frfr~~
<GOOD> Yeah I had someone to help but the trigger for the panic attack was finding out my best friend of multiple years that sorta healed my trust issues has been actively lying to my face for months, emotionally manipulating me and sending every conversation I've had w them to random strangers or people I dislike for pretty much no reason
<GOOD> So like womp womp
<GOOD> Yeah not the best situ
<GOOD> Mm, oh well
<GOOD> Just means I have to start building again
<GOOD> Maybe eventually, for now I might leave the team and just reevaluate a bit
<GOOD> 1. Already scheduled with Poik and I have cooking to do, sorry
<GOOD> 2. Yes
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Ungood
<GOOD> Trying to make homemade chips rn
<GOOD> I chopped the taters and they're in the oven at full blast
<GOOD> I hope these chips turn out ok
<GOOD> Yeah but I had to use generic veg oil instead of groundnut oil
<GOOD> And usually the estimates for time are just wrong lmao
<GOOD> You think I can afford beef?
<GOOD> Ok they're getting a bit of a skin
<GOOD> That's good
<GOOD> The chips were nice but I think they needed a lil longer
<GOOD> I'll keep that in mind next time
<GOOD> What is my therapy workbook doing man
<GOOD> I finished the therapy workbook
<GOOD> I now know how to maintain my massive gains
<GOOD> Take up gambling apparently
<GOOD> Wait wtf
<GOOD> Why is my teacher saying this
<GOOD> They're saying for my casual practice article based on some scientific papers I have to physically contact these chinese researchers
<GOOD> And then if they don't respond, just ask a few questions?
<GOOD> There's a bit of a language barrier I assume
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Also like
<GOOD> Idk how to contact them
<GOOD> Why would there be
<GOOD> I suppose
<GOOD> I can't see any
<GOOD> Also the paper was published in 2004 x_x
<GOOD> I heard that it's optional but they seem to be phrasing it as if mandatory
<GOOD> Which sounds wrong to me because like, writing a popular science article about a paper isn't fraud or anything
<GOOD> Oh my god let me out this lecture is awful
<GOOD> It's borderline nonsense
<GOOD> The chips came out perfectly
<GOOD> I added some oil when wok frying the pork and it was tender af
<GOOD> The chips were crunchy too
<GOOD> Meat was Already juicy, chips were Already seasoned
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Clay and Stephanie have split up
<GOOD> So Clay has moved to Sinnoh
<GOOD> Also my therapist said I'm on a good path
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> I have to start looking for accommodation womp womp
<GOOD> It's unlikely I'll be able to
<GOOD> And like 6 of my flatmates have already made plans so
<GOOD> ~~tbh I wouldn't have anyway because they're bringing the horrible bigoted dude w them~~
<GOOD> I may ask my friend in a diff flat what they have planned
<GOOD> I hope there could be less but I doubt I can afford that
<GOOD> Aaaa idk what to do
<GOOD> Fuck I wish I had a friend group
<GOOD> I've joined the gaming one but it's basically just mingling
<GOOD> I only know of Poutine from watching a Canadian streamer cook
<GOOD> I don't really like cheese so
<GOOD> He also cooked a ketchup cake in a frog suit sp
<GOOD> Is that an issue, sounds nutritious
<GOOD> Bugsnax
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> I need to make chips again tonight
<GOOD> They went well yesterday
<GOOD> I'm ngl I don't mind if the FNAF movie is PG 13
<GOOD> Just a random thought
<GOOD> Yeah frfr
<GOOD> LBG raaaa
<GOOD> Also FNAF tomorrow yippee
<GOOD> I'm gonna try and see it
<GOOD> I just got too nervous and busy and said I couldn't go back to see my parents for a day this weekend :((
<GOOD> I'm curious, is there some sort of registration process for updating or changing your ID?
<GOOD> Or is it just like filling out a request form
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> I read the sentence wrong
<GOOD> The only ID I have is my provisional license and I'm M on that because I haven't bothered getting another ID
<GOOD> Ik this sounds stupid but like, does just an ID card exist that you can get issued
<GOOD> Because if I didn't drive I wouldn't have an ID
<GOOD> Well I don't drive but like I did a while ago
<GOOD> ~~Until the stress and money issues came~~
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't think the UK has an equivalent of a State ID
<GOOD> Nevermind you can
<GOOD> I'm just dumb and didn't realise
<GOOD> Yeah I kinda wondered where non-driving people get ID
<GOOD> I feel really stupid rn
<GOOD> We don't have DMVs or whatever iirc
<GOOD> As long as I've seen
<GOOD> I thought you needed a passport to travel anywhere wha
<GOOD> America in general seems scary, it's one of the few places I haven't considered going to
<GOOD> Probably misinformation tho
<GOOD> Same as the UK then, probably why I don't wanna bother
<GOOD> Like US culture doesn't interest me nearly as much as other countries
<GOOD> Only reason I'd go is better Marine Bio jobs
<GOOD> And cooler ocean life
<GOOD> There are 2 americans in my flat and 1 of them is a caricature lmao
<GOOD> He has blond wavy hair and he's a surfer dude that constantly complains about english things and how american things and brands aren't available here
<GOOD> Prettyyyy
<GOOD> I haven't heard yard that often tbh, it's usually just garden
<GOOD> Almost 60 now
<GOOD> Fnaf movie leak
<GOOD> I love when people do this and the only evidence they can pull up of visible gore is the scoop
<GOOD> I can't tell if Matt genuinely doesn't like FNAF theorising or he's playing it up for funny tbh
<GOOD> Because a lot of the time he seems kinda fed up with it (understandably)
<GOOD> Pixel gun 3D
<GOOD> Oh wait that's knight Silver lol
<GOOD> I usually see that bluish glow and immediately think it's like a roblox skin or smth
<GOOD> I can't get it out of my head that the quills aren't quills
<GOOD> I can't accept that they aren't just hair
<GOOD> I've tricked myself into believing my brain is a different person and they can therefore validate me better
<GOOD> I think my positive quality book has helped somewhat
<GOOD> Erm, gamers... assemble
<GOOD> Just say that you've never done {bad thing}
<GOOD> Or just strange things, for some reason ppl admire me for not drinking in my uni and I'm like yeah cuz it tastes shit
<GOOD> (No drinking isn't bad it was an example)
<GOOD> Based Sakurai
<GOOD> I wish people would actually follow through on plans
<GOOD> I don't hate x but I do hate when people make their whole personality x is such a common scapegoat
<GOOD> Rules for thee not for me, always the way
<GOOD> Someone once started beef with me and said it was my whole personality for posting this in genchat lmao
<GOOD> Also accused me of being heated for correcting someone who used the wrong pronouns lmao
<GOOD> Silly fellows
<GOOD> I don't want to see genchat ever Dark
<GOOD> I will delete it
<GOOD> Bro thought I was like DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH
<GOOD> I need to shop so much tomorrow
<GOOD> Nope, writing it after I eat
<GOOD> True!
<GOOD> I just write a list and then snake through every isle in case I forgot
<GOOD> My dad loves that movie for some reason
<GOOD> Yeah but it's uncharacteristic
<GOOD> Very stoic man
<GOOD> I arrived like 20 minutes early once and just walked up and down the street outside the store
<GOOD> I have nothing in my fridge rn
<GOOD> Like literally nothing
<GOOD> Apart from this milk carton that has 1 more bowl of cereal left for tomorrow
<GOOD> I got scared in Cars 2 when the car got crushed
<GOOD> Cars 2 is a horrifying thing to show to children
<GOOD> Not because it's scary because it's cars 2
<GOOD> As a kid I was suprised at the gore in cars 2 during like the bathroom fight
<GOOD> When they keep getting smashed into a wall
<GOOD> I loved that movie
<GOOD> I used to cry at the Toy Story 2 jessie scene but that's understandable
<GOOD> Because it's upsetting
<GOOD> I watched a bunch of these not quite yugioh shows
<GOOD> Also Gormiti which was such an odd series
<GOOD> Cuz like their main gimmick was that every merch made of them were bath bomb toys
<GOOD> My little brother was scared of the movie Zathura
<GOOD> But he kept watching it anyway
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> He got scared at the robot and lizard alien parts
<GOOD> Cocomelon clears DB unfortunately
<GOOD> Spy kids ass scene
<GOOD> I was allowed to watch Family Guy but was too scared of House of the Dead on the Wii to watch my dad play it
<GOOD> I hear it in my head
<GOOD> Wait fuck nvm I played that one
<GOOD> It was a PS3 one because it looked super realistic (I was used to the Wii)
<GOOD> I love typing of the dead
<GOOD> Simpsons is for the family
<GOOD> I think the Simpsons in early seasons is very adult in the sense It's actually mature
<GOOD> Ohhhh
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I thought you were slandering the Bleeding Gums Murphy ep fr
<GOOD> Yeah that's what Marcel said
<GOOD> Family Guy is adult in the sense that kids can't watch the content in it, not that it actually tackles mature issues
<GOOD> You could say that it seems today, that all you see
<GOOD> It makes me laugh hard af
<GOOD> I will post rot boy in retaliation
<GOOD> I have never watched The Cleveland Show
<GOOD> Just in general
<GOOD> So is family guy
<GOOD> I didn't expect it to be good lol
<GOOD> Also holy shit finally, a company understands ME
<GOOD> Also how do you usually comm art from twitter people
<GOOD> I might commission that person that drew the pride flag mons
<GOOD> I've never set up paypal oopsie
<GOOD> Definitely putting them away for later tho I love their art and their prices are fair af
<GOOD> Hell has begun
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> thank you for introducing me to that artist
<GOOD> They're so epic
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Mm, I feel a bit better than a few days ago
<GOOD> I'm watching FNAF tomorrow and I have a week off now
<GOOD> So I feel p good
<GOOD> Gonna knock out a big assignment I need to do
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Watching FNAF in an hour
<GOOD> I'm getting better at identifying AI
<GOOD> Tho w this image it isn't hard
<GOOD> Ehhh sorta, it has its own style
<GOOD> Tho can I really say it has its own style
<GOOD> It did make its own but from stolen art so idk
<GOOD> My lecturer has only gone well if you want to use it go nuts, but it'll only give you a base overview
<GOOD> You see that's what I dislike about the anti-AI talks, it's obviously fine to hate it but saying it's bad because it produces bad products is a vert stupid way of thinking
<GOOD> Since we've already seen it get better
<GOOD> Yeah but the thing is, it can't do this! Can't last forever
<GOOD> There are plenty of valid reasons to hate AI but that isn't the way you should be seeing it
<GOOD> I remember ppl mocking it for not being able to do fingers or irises
<GOOD> Now ppl are mocking it for being unable to create large groups of people
<GOOD> I mean ppl are hoping the AI art consumes itself and degrades
<GOOD> But I doubt it
<GOOD> Yeah and people are hoping that it doing that creates trends and flaws
<GOOD> But by that point it'll probably be hyper refined
<GOOD> There isn't like a turnback point now so imma just use AI as a cooking aid and for art inspiration
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> It's so true
<GOOD> I'm watching it in 10 minutes
<GOOD> This cinema has a weird halloween sour purple slush I'm gonna try
<GOOD> Spoon I had to take a TRAIN to get to the nearest cinema screening it
<GOOD> Imagine girlfriend
<GOOD> Eh I don't wanna get into my takes on that
<GOOD> The people in front of me in this queue just spent like 40 quid on cinema food
<GOOD> Wtf
<GOOD> I had to have cherry raaaa
<GOOD> Just ask your gf if she'd still love you if you were a fly
<GOOD> Well chat, I'm gonna turn my phone off
<GOOD> Will review FNAF when I'm out
<GOOD> However I will say  this shit was 4 quid
<GOOD> Har har har har har
<GOOD> I couldn't stop thinking about that fucking tiktok series
<GOOD> Tbh I know for a fact I'm in the tiny group of ppl this movie was made for
<GOOD> Because like it was not good from an objective standpoint
<GOOD> I just loved it
<GOOD> I would have paid 8 for any crumb of Springbonnie anyway
<GOOD> So I enjoyed the movie
<GOOD> Also like, my favourite animatronic is springbonnie man
<GOOD> I'm finally eating
<GOOD> It literally has never had an official render or anything iirc
<GOOD> Springbonnie is springtrap before Afton dies in the suit
<GOOD> So even if it's ||in the slightly mangy state it appears in in the movie|| it's still springbonnie
<GOOD> God that suit is so badass
<GOOD> Freddy fastbear
<GOOD> That's faie
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> Idk if I'm too used to slop but I didn't mind that
<GOOD> What collection is this
<GOOD> Wish I had some money to spare for this
<GOOD> Also how does humble bundle work
<GOOD> I don't get it
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I hear God Eater is good
<GOOD> I should look into Humble
<GOOD> Budget bundled games are my jam
<GOOD> How much is Pac Museum normally btw
<GOOD> I might buy this bundle
<GOOD> Idek if my PC can run half of these lmao
<GOOD> Why does Humble feel suspicious
<GOOD> Like they're giving to charity but how do they get these things so cheap
<GOOD> What keeps them running
<GOOD> Ngl
<GOOD> I might buy the Sid Meyer Bundle instead
<GOOD> I kinda want a strategy game for my PC
<GOOD> That's fair
<GOOD> How do they get so many keys tho
<GOOD> Ig
<GOOD> I may buy the Civ 6 one idkkkk
<GOOD> I'm not usually a strategy person but I'm bad at using keyboard and mouse for anything else
<GOOD> I had that on my PS4, despised playing it
<GOOD> I know it's probably a good game but like
<GOOD> I enjoyed Mario vs Rabbids more because I'm a bitch lol
<GOOD> It felt more like a puzzle than you lost a gamble, gfy and your party perma dies
<GOOD> Aaaa idk which
<GOOD> I'll wait a few days then decide
<GOOD> Sounds nice
<GOOD> Actually I think I'll buy Sid Meyer if I have any leftover money, I'm not really a tekken fan
<GOOD> And my interest in everything except Pac Man there are minimal
<GOOD> Yeah I was looking at that
<GOOD> I may also get some FNAF fangames but that's after I figure out how to put my headphones into my PC
<GOOD> Is Civ a good game btw?
<GOOD> I mean this comes w 5 and 6
<GOOD> And 4 and 3
<GOOD> And 1
<GOOD> And a bunch of weird sims like trains
<GOOD> Only person I've ever seen hyperfixated on trains was a very slimy and creepy dude at my secondary school so
<GOOD> They also got severely in trouble for spending their computer science lesson signing up our compsci teacher for a bunch of newsletters about trains
<GOOD> >curate twitter feed
>open twitter
>accounts have completely shut down or are posting calls to action and nothing else
<GOOD> Man Earth sucks
<GOOD> They're completely justified but sometimes I do just want to escape from the sobering horrific reality of our situation
<GOOD> Mine was ocean creatures
<GOOD> And Pikmin
<GOOD> But then all the ocean creature accounts are now shutting down
<GOOD> Also Garten of Skylines
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> The fans trying to measure Sonic up to Mario still is still kinda sad
<GOOD> Like from what I understand Superstars is decent, you are allowed to have a game in your franchise like that
<GOOD> Sonic doesn't really have peak anymore, people just gas up games that are good within the franchise
<GOOD> Which is fine, we're the pokemon fandom that's what we do
<GOOD> Yeah but you wouldn't believe the flak I got for saying Frontiers wasn't a 10/10 when the game released
<GOOD> My previous friend group had the forbidden trifecta of the majority of them being Spider man, Dragonball and Sonic fans all at once
<GOOD> I voted Genshin as the player's choice in GotY so my friend could get rewards in the game and they said I personally hated them and was doing it to spite them
<GOOD> I mean my very first impression of Frontiers was that it was kinda cool, heavily cinematic and the setting and random assets were weird lookiny
<GOOD> I've mostly just seen Sonic fans trying to gas up Superstars as a competitor
<GOOD> I would have agreed but there are 3 reasons for me not to:
-TGA is a sham, it doesn't really matter lmao
-Genshin gave tangible rewards so I was just helping a friend that plays it
-Sonic fans started being violently racist when they were winning
<GOOD> Or at least a vocal minority
<GOOD> They kinda poked the bear on that one then complained when they lost
<GOOD> I mean yeah huge game release
<GOOD> Happened to me w Spiderman 2
<GOOD> Also happened w Frontiers DLC, that was everywhere on day of release
<GOOD> Ppl gassed it up and were mocking people for people not liking it bc of difficulty (very fun)
<GOOD> Then say what you're saying
<GOOD> Yeah that's what I kept seeing and it was brushed off with ERM ERM ERM BUT YOU SAID IT WAS TOO EASY!?!?!?!?
<GOOD> I saw it a bit with Superstars too but not as much
<GOOD> Not really the issue at hand tho, even if you didn't there's a clear difference between a genuine issue with unfairness and making a fun but challenging experience
<GOOD> Like I've seen people complain Wonder is beating their ass but I haven't seen them say it's actually unfair
<GOOD> Since most of those levels are self contained and have something you need to learn to beat it
<GOOD> That's fair
<GOOD> Being flashy isn't enough tho
<GOOD> I would say only 1 level is truly unfair
<GOOD> And that level is like, the last one and is intended to be
<GOOD> Dw you never have to actually do it
<GOOD> ||it's like a champion's road type level||
<GOOD> This is harder than Darker Side
<GOOD> And arguably Champion's Road
<GOOD> Since it's a 2D platformer it requires uncharacteristically tight inputs at times
<GOOD> There isn't one
<GOOD> It's a lot of the 4 and 5 star levels that can be hard
<GOOD> Though I will admit that last level is a genuine unfair spike
<GOOD> I mean same here tbh
<GOOD> Yakuza and Alien Isolation are the games that come to mind
<GOOD> I bled like 30-40 lives on that level despite barely having issues the rest of the game lol
<GOOD> Actually more like 20-30
<GOOD> Lost Levels is the most poorly designed Mario game because all of its levels are unfairly hard lol
<GOOD> I played Super Meat Boy up to Cotton Alley
<GOOD> But I'd say I'm fairly good at 2D platformers and the level is hard
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Procrastination
<GOOD> Toad is also in C
<GOOD> Just not too big a fan of Toads unless they are Captain or Blue toad
<GOOD> I like Yoshi
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> My tierings of the partners are based off design only
<GOOD> And what little I know of them
<GOOD> I have Banjo Kazooie on my list first
<GOOD> And Yoshi's Island
<GOOD> (Maybe Wooly World too but like idk)
<GOOD> I've only played DS Yoshi's island as a kid
<GOOD> What about Yoshi's universal gravitation
<GOOD> I have never played a Fire Emblem game
<GOOD> Oh you meant Link's Awakening
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I haven't played any because FE isn't interesting to me
<GOOD> I will never make a judgement on best game
<GOOD> After not liking BotW I did like TotK
<GOOD> So that was pleasant
<GOOD> Imo neither of the open world ones are 10/10
<GOOD> They both have quite a lot of issues
<GOOD> Agree
<GOOD> Only proper Zelda I've finished is Link Between Worlds
<GOOD> Then I played the 2 open world ones
<GOOD> I feel like I haven't found my big impact game tbh
<GOOD> None ever properly grip me
<GOOD> I am still not an RPG person
<GOOD> The only Tactic/strategy game I play is Pikmin
<GOOD> And it's sad because Pikmin is my favourite game franchise but nothing else like it exists
<GOOD> I genuinely think that as far as games I've played goes, Olimar is the best character Nintendo has made
<GOOD> Pikmin 1 is an oddly introspective and profound experience sometimes
<GOOD> It's weird
<GOOD> Isn't that second dude from guilty gear
<GOOD> I fucking wish I could understand some masterpiece games like P5
<GOOD> Like most games being called masterpieces I just... don't understand
<GOOD> And it's kinda annoying
<GOOD> Yeah but it just makes me feel bad that I can't sit through stuff like Persona
<GOOD> It just makes me think I'm missing out
<GOOD> Like I spent ~11 hours in Persona 5 Royal and nothing happened
<GOOD> At least to interest me
<GOOD> I should probably try it
<GOOD> Like the dialogue just felt so fluffy
<GOOD> I mean I've sat through dialogue in other games
<GOOD> It's just that you have to make the dialogue either concise or interesting
<GOOD> A lot of P5R's opening dialogue is just how shitty Kamoshida is and then conversations that don't really interest me all that much
<GOOD> Like a bunch of exposition dumping about palaces etc
<GOOD> I sat and read the P5 dialogue because I heard it was super good and a masterpiece game
<GOOD> But then when I told ppl about my issue they were like oh you should have skipped through that it takes ages to start
<GOOD> Maybe I'm just too impatient for RPGs
<GOOD> I hope I find my life changing game eventually
<GOOD> I started that too
<GOOD> I'm playing Portal 2 rn tho
<GOOD> I just finished Portal 1
<GOOD> Very glad to hear more of Glados being an ass to me
<GOOD> Because it's so funny
<GOOD> Guys I'm fucked
<GOOD> I need to write an article
<GOOD> And make it interesting
<GOOD> What similar stories could there be lol
<GOOD> My dad is telling me he likes the one piece live action a lot
<GOOD> Almost there
<GOOD> 3 more ribbons here then it's onto the Switch
<GOOD> Almost done
<GOOD> The non-ticked and non-crossed out ones are what I have left
<GOOD> So 6 more and all but 1 are free
<GOOD> Master Rank and Ancient Past
<GOOD> I forgot the actual name of the Ancient Past one
<GOOD> Win an online Master Rank match w the mon in your team and take a pic with them in PLA
<GOOD> Um, yeah
<GOOD> Ursaring can't be in Galar, that's why it can't have the SwSh ribbons there
<GOOD> In fact there's only a handful of mons that can get the highest amount of ribbons rn
<GOOD> Middle square
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Paldea Champ
<GOOD> It also has some marsk
<GOOD> Marks
<GOOD> Porygon falls at the first hurdle because a shadow Porygon doesn't exist
<GOOD> Well to get every ribbon you have to
<GOOD> Then just get all the possible ribbons on Porygon
<GOOD> A ribbon master is a ribbon master
<GOOD> Revolution?
<GOOD> You don't need XD
<GOOD> Colosseum is the minimum requirement
<GOOD> And you can also just emulate that
<GOOD> Dolphin
<GOOD> And a ROM of the game
<GOOD> You go through the effort to make the mon a ribbon master, who cares if I paid 300 to play XD to get it
<GOOD> Paywalling ribbon masters is just ass lol
<GOOD> Because there is an e reader shadow Scizor
<GOOD> The scizor can be shiny hunted/RNG manipulated
<GOOD> Also it makes it a bit more special
<GOOD> I just emulated XD, Colo and Emerald
<GOOD> Then injected Diamond
<GOOD> The ribbon community actively encourages and doesnt mind emulators so like why not
<GOOD> I mean if you like throwing money at the retro game market scalpers go nuts
<GOOD> Not like it changes much
<GOOD> My Ursaring is treasured all the same
<GOOD> Cuz I put in all the effort to get it this far
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Btw XD is the only way to make the gen 3 grind even mildly tolerable
<GOOD> And it's like $300 loose
<GOOD> Revisiting gen 4 has only degraded my opinion of it lol
<GOOD> Being in new gens has been so freeing
<GOOD> DPP is so slow
<GOOD> I revisited DP last week and it was so boring
<GOOD> And like, BDSP is just the same game but more fun
<GOOD> I'm ngl Plat probably isn't even good enough for me to justify not playing a faster game over it lmao
<GOOD> Yeah I know I sat through 5 hours of battle animations
<GOOD> Fun fact one of the ribbons does force you to keep battle animations on for 50 battles including lag between consoles
<GOOD> I would have if I could lmao
<GOOD> The gen 4 Link Multi tower forces both players to watch the animations
<GOOD> And it's fucking misery
<GOOD> 50 battles of it
<GOOD> And you have tp pay attention the whole time because if you lose you start again
<GOOD> It only gets worse on revisit dw
<GOOD> That sounds unfortunate
<GOOD> Anyway shout out to gen 6 battle maison for being the fastest facility so fat
<GOOD> Far
<GOOD> 2 attempts and once I revised my team it was actually kinda fun
<GOOD> Hope this continues w Battle Tree
<GOOD> Battle Tree is just Maison w megas/Z moves at least, so it's equally exploitable
<GOOD> Jelliron will work this time
<GOOD> I used Aromaron in Maison
<GOOD> I might do another RM after Ursaring but like
<GOOD> And if it is it'll be an easy one
<GOOD> Like Tinkaton
<GOOD> Or some gen 7 mon
<GOOD> I hope battle tree goes well
<GOOD> It's my final hurdle
<GOOD> Yeah I can still cheese doubles w a lv 1 Aron hopefully
<GOOD> Aromatisse Aron carried me earlier so
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> It's fine, it's a PG-13 horror movie there isn't much to say objectively
<GOOD> I think that statement is untrue, a lot of the scenes are hilarious in an ironic sense
<GOOD> Though that may be because this was in my head the whole time
<GOOD> keep random stuff out of here
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Hi chat my ribbon master is now in BDSP
<GOOD> I accidentally boiled an entire head of broccoli
<GOOD> And I just had to like eat a bowl of broccoli with my dinner
<GOOD> At least it's good for me
<GOOD> I'll buy more veg later in the week
<GOOD> Enjoy getting the rest
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Making a pronoun page
<GOOD> I don't think it sucks
<GOOD> It's just hard
<GOOD> I getcha
<GOOD> 1-1 with coin magnet
<GOOD> Also I think imma try a few more labels
<GOOD> Oop I forgor to add demiboy x_x
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Ok those are good I think
<GOOD> At least that's what I'm trying out
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Polyamory and Polygamy is a thing sometimes
<GOOD> A lot of things are the default tho
<GOOD> Probably why it's important to distinguish things
<GOOD> I like the current het flag tbh, at least the one I've seen
<GOOD> The blue white pink one
<GOOD> I mean the original was made as a hate symbol so yeah probably lmao
<GOOD> Or at least debuted alongside it
<GOOD> The black and white one is the original
<GOOD> At least that I know of
<GOOD> One sec
<GOOD> Oh I've gotten mixed up
<GOOD> Nah apparently the russian government made its own straight pride flag that basically denounced everything else
<GOOD> I was under the misconception they made the lego burglar looking one
<GOOD> Imma try out agender/flux for a while at least
<GOOD> Idk, I just prefer saying I'm het to I love WOMEN
<GOOD> Not sure if there's really a sexuality for an agender person that likes only women
<GOOD> Or well, flux since sometimes I feel more masc-
<GOOD> Idk I'm just learning these things and they feel like they describe me but idkkkk
<GOOD> I think since I feel masc a lot of the time I prefer saying het
<GOOD> Also just saying but this flag goes hard as fuck
<GOOD> Like half of the ones I have here are black/grey {ConcernedPoliwhirl}
<GOOD> But tbf that's because monogamy and monoamory are there
<GOOD> I'm kinda new to like sub-labels inside the umbrellas I already identified as so I'm trying a few out
<GOOD> I didn't know what most of them meant till today
<GOOD> That's p much me with masc
<GOOD> Everyone special raaa
<GOOD> Fortnite battle pass
<GOOD> Isn't gacha typically linked with the capsule type system specifically involving purchaseable currency for gambling on units
<GOOD> Since gacha literally came from capsule machines
<GOOD> Yoshi literally carries babies
<GOOD> I love Yoshi's Island artstyle
<GOOD> A lot of them seem rlly cool :((
<GOOD> Their artstyle is so pretty
<GOOD> I played Yoshi in postgame
<GOOD> Because I love Yoshi
<GOOD> Yoshi's Cookie NES
<GOOD> DS Yoshi's Island is heavily divided
<GOOD> I played and beat it as a kid so no official opinion
<GOOD> At least Yoshi's New Island(?) Has this banger moment
<GOOD> I beat it as a kid so I doubt it
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yosher
<GOOD> Yoshi Universal Gravitation
<GOOD> I really wanna play Wooly World tbh
<GOOD> Also Punk
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> I got it wrong again
<GOOD> Nevermind sorry for bothering you
<GOOD> New labels raaa
<GOOD> That Yoshi as a franchise isn't good
<GOOD> Its relevance is entirely held up by like 2 decent games, 1 rlly good game and being related to Mario
<GOOD> I'm sorry Marcel
<GOOD> I keep saying the wrong name it's so frustrating
<GOOD> Kirby is absolutely the guinea pig
<GOOD> Just look at robobot
<GOOD> Kirby has been and done everything
<GOOD> Mario is also a guinea pig tbf
<GOOD> Because it's like wow what if Kirby but robot and that was the sales pitch and it worked
<GOOD> And what if Kirby but golf ball and that was the sales pitch and it worked
<GOOD> I should really play DK Tropical Freeze
<GOOD> They aren't that unsafe
<GOOD> Wooly World was the only big jump in terms of experimentation (and maybe Yoshi's Story?)
<GOOD> Ehhh
<GOOD> It's not really that experimental everyone wanted to cram movement gimmicks in games
<GOOD> Yeah because Mario hasn't had experimental or bad games
<GOOD> I don't think Mario's brand is gonna be hurt by a shit game with a weird concept every once in a while
<GOOD> Hell they made mario vs rabbids and it isn't even bad
<GOOD> I was being sarcastic
<GOOD> Mario has plenty of experimental or bad games
<GOOD> Aforementioned Mario vs DK series
<GOOD> It's not all bad but it's def experimental
<GOOD> Also Mario vs Rabbids
<GOOD> Mario but also it's XCOM and Rabbids are there is a batshit concept
<GOOD> Also like the concept of most Mario sports games
<GOOD> And the execution of some particularly mid ones
<GOOD> Like this is an image from the mario sports games
<GOOD> Unless it's Mario + Final Fantasy + sports
<GOOD> Which happened in 2 more games than it should have
<GOOD> I hear everything after Sticker Star is p good
<GOOD> Basically everything but Sticker Star which is the only one I've played
<GOOD> People shit on Dream Team/Paper Jam too much
<GOOD> 4 years is an understatement
<GOOD> They pull those mfs out every time in 2D Mario since World
<GOOD> It has Antasma (S tier)
<GOOD> I mean 5 of them are technically
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> His design is ok
<GOOD> And I don't like Mario
<GOOD> I mean he wasn't really tossed out, he had a full boss fight
<GOOD> Wait Doesn't BiS and SSS have a bowser form for the final boss tho
<GOOD> Where it's just someone else that looks like Bowser
<GOOD> At least that's my understanding of it
<GOOD> And Paper Jam had the sick ass cardboard bowser armour
<GOOD> It's not bowser it just looks exactly like him
<GOOD> Dry Bowser is only a secret boss
<GOOD> Yeah but it takes the form of dark bowser because...?
<GOOD> They needed a new bowser form
<GOOD> I actually got there once, very suprising
<GOOD> I never got to Bowser Jr in Dream Team tho
<GOOD> Pillodium EX too hard
<GOOD> Also Dream Team had Dreamy Luigi battles so L
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Zee keeper is a bomb ass fight
<GOOD> They look awesome
<GOOD> I have only played Dream Team, Paper Jam and a bit of SSS
<GOOD> Up to the Chucklehuck Woods boss fight
<GOOD> This reminds me of that fucking Open Season video I keep seeing
<GOOD> Have you not seen it?
<GOOD> One sec
<GOOD> Oh my god I can't find it
<GOOD> I sound so stupid
<GOOD> Idk why I find the video I'm looking for funny
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Only the audio
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Thanks
<GOOD> this vid
<GOOD> Does anyone have some neat simple recipes for me to try having
<GOOD> Preferably meat dishes
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> I spent all day working and playing BDSP
<GOOD> Is that Klink's actual shiny?
<GOOD> Oh neat
<GOOD> Not usually a fan of green but this one goes hard tbh
<GOOD> You need to find something that grinds your gears first
<GOOD> Idk I've never played a fangame of anything lol
<GOOD> Which is a really strange thing to say
<GOOD> Only a bit of romhacks
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Doesn't sound like a remix but it sounds like music for an online service like mystery gift lmao
<GOOD> I mean happy employees w good retention is happy employees w good retention
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> Eh it's just technically correct
<GOOD> Yeah but they aren't lies really
<GOOD> If you're talking objectively their workers don't want a union
<GOOD> And that's because they hire non-union workers
<GOOD> Those look nice
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Watching Family Guy rn as background music
<GOOD> I was distracted and got scared because the fucking troll song came on
<GOOD> Susmerged Gyattscle
<GOOD> In Ohio
<GOOD> I will discombobulate the water wraith with purple pikmin
<GOOD> Not even that
<GOOD> Water wraith is just kinda nothing
<GOOD> At least in our dimension
<GOOD> Idk whether I prefer Discombobulate or the Matrix throat poke video
<GOOD> I can't see this word without laughing anymore
<GOOD> Skibidi wraith...
<GOOD> It looks like it has horns for legs
<GOOD> Sending this again
<GOOD> Because apparently it's relevant again
<GOOD> (Volume warning ofc)
<GOOD> I hope mot
<GOOD> GET
<GOOD> Dman is becoming a sigma rizzler
<GOOD> The purple pikmin otw to discombobulate the water wraith
<GOOD> I think purples may be my favourite of the colours in Pik 1 and 2
<GOOD> I love ourple
<GOOD> Idk if Glows will become my favourite type when I play 4 or not
<GOOD> They look cool but like
<GOOD> Purples are adorable
<GOOD> I love them
<GOOD> My eyes glazed over when you said that
<GOOD> Idk whether to get 3 or 4 next
<GOOD> Speaking of chibi robo
<GOOD> I watched the new scott the woz video
<GOOD> Crazy that the next console is almost out
<GOOD> I really hope the patent is real
<GOOD> Or at least what they're making next
<GOOD> Gex niiiight
<GOOD> Ohio rizz...
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I forgot tbh
<GOOD> I'll have to check
<GOOD> Oh right
<GOOD> Bye witp
<GOOD> Already
<GOOD> They were easier in SMW what
<GOOD> That isn't an issue
<GOOD> Not really
<GOOD> The Broodles are all ugly af
<GOOD> Apart from Topper ig
<GOOD> I hate that this was the first thing I thought of
<GOOD> Lucky
<GOOD> I have an artist in mind to comm but the art is like 30 so I'm saving
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> AVGN beat Jekyll and Hyde
<GOOD> This is a historic moment
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> Yeah I think Bebop is coming too
<GOOD> 1 ribbon to go
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> I have to win in a Master rank online match
<GOOD> With Clay in the team
<GOOD> Cooking a team later
<GOOD> For now imma rest and watch yt
<GOOD> Maybe grind the gourmand mark later
<GOOD> I kinda wanna do another ribbon master
<GOOD> LMAO
<GOOD> Another game
<GOOD> Why is it Fall Guys
<GOOD> VILL
<GOOD> BOOSTER COURSE WAVE 6
<GOOD> They can't keep this fucking track out of their game for 1 entry
<GOOD> In the other titles yes
<GOOD> Nobody likes the SNES courses STOP BRINGING THEM BACK
<GOOD> I'm fine w this one because they actually changed it
<GOOD> Yes, because Tour's maps are like, good
<GOOD> And haven't been in DS Retro, Super Circuit Retro, 3DS Retro and now Switch Retro
<GOOD> Like holy fuck let it die
<GOOD> Yeah but come on
<GOOD> They had to choose SNES Bowser's Castle 3 again?
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I don't really care I'm just tired of them bringing back SNES Bowser's Castle/Mario Circuit
<GOOD> Why excluding tour
<GOOD> Yeah and most of its tracks are in 8D
<GOOD> Isn't Ninja Hideaway a Tour track
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Point being stop bringing back SNES Bowser
<GOOD> At least we have pirahna plant cove
<GOOD> And DK mountain
<GOOD> I think switch 2 comes first
<GOOD> The longer we wait the more likely it is that we get a new console soon
<GOOD> I have no idea when they announce new ones
<GOOD> I also don't know the distance between announcement and release
<GOOD> Hopefully sooner rather than later
<GOOD> I really want a new console
<GOOD> Yeah it's usually at a convention
<GOOD> Isn't E3 gone now tho
<GOOD> Iirc they did actually show off the switch 2 internally a few months ago
<GOOD> Although unsure if that was debunked
<GOOD> Also this patent leak thing
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> I mean I like the pitched idea
<GOOD> In this patent apparently the top screen is 3D
<GOOD> And since the screen seems to be transparent(?) You fold it down
<GOOD> Or something to that effect
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> That sounds like a sick idea
<GOOD> If it isn't broken
<GOOD> >if it isn't broken
<GOOD> I hate that this made me think of that fake podcast again
<GOOD> I have actual brainrot
<GOOD> Yes I just can't get those videos out
<GOOD> I don't wanna hear about Boxy Boo
<GOOD> But look at this It's John Pork
<GOOD> That would go viral
<GOOD> It's literally those dudes doing the same thing
<GOOD> Vill help
<GOOD> But how will I know what happens to visually impaired sonic
<GOOD> You should check{cursedmeow}
<GOOD> I just watched the helluva boss video again
<GOOD> This yt channel is absolutely my guilty pleasure
<GOOD> But what about boxy boo
<GOOD> I can't help it the videos make me cackle
<GOOD> This is my Story of Undertale
<GOOD> Darkest kid's show ever made (Helluva Boss)
<GOOD> Yeah but it's not a kid's show lmao
<GOOD> Smh you did not watch the builtbygamers video
<GOOD> Also apparently this is an official 2014 crossover art for pokemon
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> I wasn't sure if fanart or not
<GOOD> But yeah
<GOOD> It's odd that they did that tbh
<GOOD> Like, Ito is one of the last people I'd expect them to cross over with
<GOOD> The Ito MtG cards make me wanna play MtG
<GOOD> Oh shit apparently they're adding these in the last wave
<GOOD> Could also mean a lot more Tour costumes we didn't see
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I mean
<GOOD> It's a nice feature to have
<GOOD> I assume because Pauline is a lot taller than the others
<GOOD> I hate Daisy raaa
<GOOD> Nah I'm learning heavies so I can play Funky
<GOOD> I played as blue toad
<GOOD> DOLPHIN COSTUME
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> Lefty is 5 dollars
<GOOD> Also apparently the FNAF movie 2 already had a script and they're reworking it based on criticisms from this film
<GOOD> >rework
<GOOD> I doubt they give a shit about critic feedback considering the success of this film
<GOOD> Whatever ig
<GOOD> Idk why you asked if you were just gonna ask the same question after I answered
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Critics are not the only people that can criticise a movie
<GOOD> FNAF started out of spite lmao
<GOOD> I've GYATT to see where this series is going!!!
<GOOD> I've watched this one video like 5 times in 1 day and I can't get over it
<GOOD> No I love this video
<GOOD> Yes?
<GOOD> I will keep sending this
<GOOD> Steak is so pricey
<GOOD> Just got a random shiny Swablu
<GOOD> I mean he was criticised after so so so many failures being told his designs looked way too creepy so he was like fine yeah fuck you and made FNAF
<GOOD> Closest I can find is the wiki entry showing that the criticism and failure of Chipper's made him super depressed
<GOOD> Being sent into depression over a criticism then going I bet I could make it fucking terrifying sounds a lot like it
<GOOD> Like afaik, Scott was gonna give up after like 50+ failures
<GOOD> He made so many games
<GOOD> Keyword being the fans
<GOOD> Scott is going to listen to the criticism of his target audience, not the critics saying erm why is the bear evil???
<GOOD> But what about boxy boo
<GOOD> I mean in FNAF security breach bears are extinct apparently lmao
<GOOD> If we're to believe HAND unit
<GOOD> Or whatever the voice is called
<GOOD> Oh it's unused dialogue nvm
<GOOD> I still find it funny tho
<GOOD> Saving up to commission
<GOOD> NSAB2 looks good
<GOOD> However next thing I'm buying is probably gonna be a comm pfp
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> I thought you were talking about the pfp lol
<GOOD> I think I want the pfp to be Hisuian Goodra
<GOOD> It's been my 2nd favourite mon for a long long while
<GOOD> and this person's artstyle feels like it'll make them look super cozy
<GOOD> I'm gonna comm a diorama style onw
<GOOD> One
<GOOD> Like their own pfp with the pokeball
<GOOD> I just need to draw up an idea so they know what to do
<GOOD> Current idea is just H Goodra chilling in a lil swamp
<GOOD> Ye or just chilling in the water
<GOOD> Issue is I can't draw them well
<GOOD> I don't like the animation for them relaxing (the shell one)
<GOOD> I just love the hunched over pose but it's hard to visualise
<GOOD> I can't like visualise H Goodra sitting down
<GOOD> Cuz of their massive ass shell
<GOOD> Aww
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> I feel so bad for this dude
<GOOD> Justin Wong?
<GOOD> He created one of the most iconic moments in gaming history by losing a match and it has since been represented in so many media it's insane
<GOOD> His loss gets rubbed in his face constantly I respect him laughing about it
<GOOD> If you didn't already know
<GOOD> It's just one of those things
<GOOD> I don't watch fighting games either
<GOOD> It's the same pose
<GOOD> Plus it's funny that it even looks like it considering it's already fucking everywhere
<GOOD> Bounty istg
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> In kickboxing
<GOOD> Do NOT tell me about kicking and blocking
<GOOD> Nope, mostly just core exercises at home and walking up and down the steepest hills imaginable
<GOOD> Need to start losing some weight tho
<GOOD> What is tren
<GOOD> I'm a black belt in kickboxing not substance abuse
<GOOD> Trombone
<GOOD> Holy shit Fatal Fuel Alabasta!?!?!?!
<GOOD> Those mfs had seconds to live lmao
<GOOD> That trombone better be worth it
<GOOD> Yes I am aware
<GOOD> I'm a sick animal (sick means cool)
<GOOD> All but 1 of my flatmates are now gone
<GOOD> They went home
<GOOD> Week
<GOOD> I have a week off rn
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I'm just using it to do this article work in little chunks
<GOOD> I've finished most of the text I need to now add (cited) images and a bibliography at the end
<GOOD> My flatmate was complaining that 3 of them got spiked yesterday
<GOOD> Roids
<GOOD> Spoon can I take it in the most painful and inconvenient fashion imaginable
<GOOD> Baki reference
<GOOD> I haven't watched Baki yet I still need to
<GOOD> I keep seeing the funniest clips possible
<GOOD> Buff women...
<GOOD> True buff women are hot
<GOOD> The 3 clips I've seen are the tetrahedron, the bed carrying scene and the dude breaking into the White House
<GOOD> That's mah house!
I am outside the home of former president George W Bush
<GOOD> I only weigh like 55 kilo
<GOOD> Is this like in the Willy Wonka movie where I can reach through the screen and take Tren
<GOOD> I'm weak af but I don't mind that
<GOOD> Like I'm horrifically weak
<GOOD> I struggle to open particularly heavy doors
<GOOD> Yeah I have cucumber and broccoli most days
<GOOD> It would be easy prob
<GOOD> I'm not actually a good fighter either
<GOOD> I just have good technique
<GOOD> Also for Baki what is this
<GOOD> I don't understand
<GOOD> Why are there apple fritters
<GOOD> And I still need to lose weight
<GOOD> I have dysmorphia from what I've been eating
<GOOD> Or at least some sort of guilt
<GOOD> I keep buying hot chocolate sachets on sale
<GOOD> My usual daily meals are like:
Rice krispies and milk
Chicken burger
Meat, veg and some pasta/rice/chips
<GOOD> (The chicken burger is just plain in between 2 buns)
<GOOD> I mean the meat I have is usually pork or chicken
<GOOD> Because they are cheap
<GOOD> Yeah but then I have snacks
<GOOD> I have 2 biscuits and a coffee w my breakfast and a hot chocolate w 2 biscuits at night
<GOOD> I mean my meals already fill me up
<GOOD> Yeah but like I have no muscle mass so the weight is fat
<GOOD> ~~Plus I like treating myself to biscuits too much~~
<GOOD> At least today I just had a coffee and cereal w no milk because I forgot to buy them
<GOOD> I don't count calories
<GOOD> Yeah but it always makes me feel shit when my stomach sticks out x_x
<GOOD> I just kinda eat an amount that's reasonable enough but not so much that I need to keep replacing my food
<GOOD> Yeah but I despise it unfortunately
<GOOD> My stomach recently started going past my ribs when I stand and I reallllly hate it
<GOOD> I've been doing core exercises at home because I'm nervous about the gym
<GOOD> Especially because of motivation and time
<GOOD> I need more motivation to do stuff recently
<GOOD> Like, I'm nervous about the launderette in case I make an ass out of myself
<GOOD> (It sounds dumb but I've never used a washing machine)
<GOOD> I keep being made fun of for having skeleton hands lmao
<GOOD> I somehow doubt laundry is gonna click with me as much as cooking did
<GOOD> I literally never had a lesson on cooking before I came here
<GOOD> I just kinda did it
<GOOD> For cooking I usually ask chatgpt the night before
<GOOD> Super good for recipes tbh
<GOOD> Still doesn't stop my brain being like they are absolutely judging you
<GOOD> Like if I were to admit my inability to have the motivation for a schedule it would be very embarrassing
<GOOD> Yeah but it's embarrassing that like, some days I can't even be motivated to take a shower or go shopping x_x
<GOOD> At least I did today
<GOOD> Between the storms
<GOOD> Ehh not really I kinda caved and bought a haribos halloween candy bag for 60p
<GOOD> Yeah but a bag of sweets is bad for me
<GOOD> Esp when I ate them because it was a small bag
<GOOD> Yeah but like today I had so much
<GOOD> So I'm cutting back tomorrow
<GOOD> Today I had coffee, sweets and 4 biscuits
<GOOD> Which is like ouch
<GOOD> I had a hot chocolate too
<GOOD> So I'm just gonna have a coffee and 2 biscuits tomorrow
<GOOD> No those are like my unnecessary things
<GOOD> My breakfast was rice krispies (without milk because I couldn't get any) and an oven chicken burger in a bun
<GOOD> Well the chicken was the dinner
<GOOD> I'm just phrasing it shit
<GOOD> I mean I'm usually filled up from breakfast
<GOOD> I just like biscuits in hot drinks
<GOOD> I bought a box of chamomile tea bags that I'm trying to use more instead (not to dunk tho)
<GOOD> Much better for me
<GOOD> Tbf the coffee is this because it was reduced to like 1
<GOOD> Not buying it again after
<GOOD> It's absolutely overindulgence
<GOOD> That's not the point
<GOOD> It being cheap doesn't mean it's better for me
<GOOD> Hopefully imma get in the habit of just having tea and chamomile tea
<GOOD> (I don't like normal tea tho which really sucks)
<GOOD> Anyway ye tomorrow imma just have chamomile and maybe the coffee
<GOOD> And 2 biscuits, no sweets at all for about a few weeks because I never buy them
<GOOD> At least I saved on biscuits today bc I bought morrisons digestives instead
<GOOD> My shop for the next 5 days or so was like 12
<GOOD> That's what biscuits do but I'm thinking of taking your advice and trying rice cakes soon
<GOOD> Better for me
<GOOD> I don't think they would be for me
<GOOD> I love chocolate too much
<GOOD> I almost caved today and bought Cadbury's cookies but stopped myself
<GOOD> Yeah but I got 80p Morrisons digestives raaaagh
<GOOD> (They don't taste as good as hobnobs but who cares)
<GOOD> Also this is a money thing not a nutrition thing mostly
<GOOD> I just didn't respond to this
<GOOD> But my dad is v v tight with money
<GOOD> Well ofc, hot chocolate is a luxury
<GOOD> We rarely had it
<GOOD> Same as chocolate in general
<GOOD> I did splurge today I bought a morrisons fruit smoothie since I've been neglecting my fruit intake
<GOOD> That wasn't my breakfast
<GOOD> Mine was rice krispies
<GOOD> It also wasn't a meal and it wasn't tea
<GOOD> ~~I mean technically most of it was liquid so it's mostly not food~~
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Ughhhh I wanna commission this artist so badddd
<GOOD> I breathed in and realised I can see all my ribs
<GOOD> And a few when I'm not
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> I skeleton
<GOOD> Yeah but I have it anyway so
<GOOD> Also fairly sure I have like a crease in my chest?
<GOOD> Like in the middle of my chest I can like see the muscle
<GOOD> And the bone is literally right there but that's normal
<GOOD> I put my fingers under my ribcage teehee
<GOOD> Anyway willow hru
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> 25 for a pfp...
<GOOD> So cheappp
<GOOD> Such a pretty style
<GOOD> This style is too much for me to resist
<GOOD> Absolutely love it
<GOOD> Saving my money to
<GOOD> Guys
<GOOD> I kinda want the SMRPG remaster
<GOOD> I haven't played it before
<GOOD> I was given nightmares by a light gun shooter lmao
<GOOD> My dad made me play it in an arcade and it got more intense the more stressed out you were x_x
<GOOD> I watched it in cinemas then got sent the video the day after
<GOOD> Being entertaining is the purpose of a movie tbf
<GOOD> Sceon is going to make a pngtuber sona and make them cross their arms with a smug smile
<GOOD> (They are the most qualified individuals to criticise media)
<GOOD> Idk I've heard from non fans that it's fairly easy to follow
<GOOD> The only thing that's tripping everyone up is ||the presentation of golden freddy||
<GOOD> And that was a flaw imo
<GOOD> White woman jumpscare
<GOOD> Wdym for some reason
<GOOD> ||The animatronics are dangerous, don't bring the child near the animatronics or the thing that almost happens later in the movie will happen||
<GOOD> Because her emotions take over
<GOOD> She's a police officer but also a human being
<GOOD> In that moment she isn't a police officer
<GOOD> She's just a person
<GOOD> Also that
<GOOD> I doubt she'd actually shoot him
<GOOD> It was a deterrent threat
<GOOD> I meant shoot him as in Mike
<GOOD> When she says ||she'll shoot him if he brings Abby back||
<GOOD> I mean yeah because at that point Mike has kinda lost it
<GOOD> He needed sobering
<GOOD> But what is out of line with her character
<GOOD> She ||gets frantic around children being around a child murderer because that child murderer is one she's seen murder children her entire life||
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> She makes a house call about the breakin and the pills
<GOOD> I think it's just that ||she was so afraid of him she was complicit, we see how much he belittles her and the animatronics when they attack him||
<GOOD> Also the fact that entering Freddy's is a death sentence and she doesn't want police officers gunning down children
<GOOD> Like hey what if I dug up this small town cold case and sent the entire police force to their deaths
<GOOD> Especially considering ||Vanessa herself is also just afraid because she thinks William is basically unstoppable||
<GOOD> Both are true
<GOOD> Because she needed to watch over Freddy's
<GOOD> Otherwise people would just wander in and die
<GOOD> Also the franchise is long gone in that universe
<GOOD> And most of them are game plotholes
<GOOD> Plotholes like the suits having corpses inside weren't cleaned up really
<GOOD> The explanation was just oh the place stunk
<GOOD> But what's incoherent about it
<GOOD> The story is made around Afton, it has been in all of FNAF
<GOOD> Yeah let's put remnant in the movie
<GOOD> That would make a lot of sense
<GOOD> They explain it in the movie...
<GOOD> They have the yellow rabbit in the entire movie, and then have a scene saying exactly who he is
<GOOD> I think audiences have the comprehension to realise that a character in a yellow bunny suit is a child murderer by this point in the movue
<GOOD> It's not like a massive nonsense twist
<GOOD> I mean, does there need to be
<GOOD> The murders were like 30(?) Years back
<GOOD> Yeah but like he didn't do any more after that
<GOOD> But if there wasn't it isn't plot ruining
<GOOD> He is the only one with a visible reaction to it
<GOOD> Yeah William likes tying things up
<GOOD> Plus he's super egotistical which is presented well in the movie
<GOOD> And his general attitude towards Vanessa
<GOOD> And his confidence in just kinda lording over Mike
<GOOD> He's a melodromatic egotistical ass that thinks he controls everything and the movie does that well
<GOOD> (Also the scene plays out similarly in the FNAF 3 minigame)
<GOOD> He literally is terrified then laughs at actual ghosts
<GOOD> Don't watch star wars
<GOOD> I can't stop thinking about the Tate star wars thread now
<GOOD> Warning for some NSFW I think
<GOOD> I forgot tbh
<GOOD> No he isn't
<GOOD> It's very funny
<GOOD> The Brittany Bluespheres video immediately dismantles that lmao
<GOOD> And the tweet he made like yesterday
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Salty is one of my favourite youtubers
<GOOD> I remember watching his Kuru Kuru VOD in a coffee shop and I had to stop drinking because I kept almost spitting it out
<GOOD> The toriko stream is fucking hysterical
<GOOD> I have only ever seen 1 clip of this guy and it was him screenshotting an MMO woman but the sound was super loud
<GOOD> Do not even get me started
<GOOD> Hate that mf, even moreso now
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> 1 mark and 1 ribbon away from finishing my ribbon master wooo
<GOOD> Nah I need the ranked ribbon
<GOOD> I spent the last 2 days prepping
<GOOD> Also I unironically laughed at family guy :((
<GOOD> Pretty difficult when it's just a term that you've been raised on
<GOOD> I've never referred to it as such but still
<GOOD> Yeah you CAN
<GOOD> Yeah and Marcel is trying to not call cigarettes that
<GOOD> So what's the issue
<GOOD> Idk what game pass games to download
<GOOD> I've only downloaded tabs and Celeste so far
<GOOD> My PC probably struggles with 1
<GOOD> Playing Celeste
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I'm just thinking my way around a strawberry still
<GOOD> Ok I found the solution but now I have to actually pull it off
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Yay I did it
<GOOD> Strawb number 10
<GOOD> Also how do I know which areas are optional and which progress me
<GOOD> Oh idk what constitutes a stage lol
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh those
<GOOD> Uh
<GOOD> Fuck it we ball
<GOOD> I know I can
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Pretty tho
<GOOD> I'm not bothered w time but I am bothered w strawberries
<GOOD> Oml I feel so dumb lmao
<GOOD> I was trying to do some complex walljumping BS when the solution was to just dash between the 2 platforms
<GOOD> Why does her hair turn blue, is she proboun????
<GOOD> Idk why she has magic
<GOOD> But she feels awesome to control
<GOOD> Oh first chapter done
<GOOD> 15/20 strawberries womp womp
<GOOD> Nah that's not enough
<GOOD> I'll be back for them later
<GOOD> I really should buy a key for Minecraft java
<GOOD> Wh
<GOOD> Evil Madeline?
<GOOD> Is there anything I can actually do in this mirror room
<GOOD> Mvm
<GOOD> I walked to the right a bit and a cutscene happened lmao
<GOOD> Oh I got a tape
<GOOD> I'll do em later
<GOOD> I'm just figuring out this room rn
<GOOD> Yay I did it
<GOOD> It was the first of those don't touch the ground while collecting green things
<GOOD> It was hard but it's fun
<GOOD> A bit janky but that's just me I think
<GOOD> I'll learn air maneuvering better soon
<GOOD> I just got to the first segment
<GOOD> The part of You (me? Idk)
<GOOD> SHADOW Madeline
<GOOD> MAD-X
<GOOD> Ouch some strawbs are hard w badeline chasing
<GOOD> Well badeline plural
<GOOD> With 1 Badeline it's fine but now there's fiiiive
<GOOD> Ok I got away with the strawberry
<GOOD> That's all that matters
<GOOD> How many chapters is Celeste
<GOOD> Also I missed 7 strawberries this time
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> K that's enough celeste for now
<GOOD> Almost at 40 strawberries
<GOOD> I have a headache now but Celeste is fun
<GOOD> I'm cooking
<GOOD> Also I really hope that it doesn't rain again tomorrow
<GOOD> Because I've been looking forward to the fireworks all week
<GOOD> But not back to the flat
<GOOD> Just saw someone for the first time in a few days
<GOOD> Like just irl
<GOOD> Don't distribute here
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> I haven't achieved all that much
<GOOD> Yeah but like all I did was get into uni and learn to cook
<GOOD> And go to therapy but the results are kinda iffy so far
<GOOD> Yeah and yet I'm probably in more debt lmao
<GOOD> Unfortunately I'm incapable of praising myself for big achievements
<GOOD> Only tiny inconsequential ones
<GOOD> Celeste is fun
<GOOD> Also afaik Move it is all motion
<GOOD> Thank gid
<GOOD> God
<GOOD> I really want it but I think I'll cop SMRPG remake
<GOOD> Since I've never played it
<GOOD> And I do want to try traditional turn based RPGs
<GOOD> Is SMRPG good or is that a dumb question
<GOOD> Like is it long enough to justify the price, enough content, etc
<GOOD> Of course it can but like, I do need content rn
<GOOD> Metroid games are fantastic because they are bite sized
<GOOD> I'm just saying that's not the kind of game I'm going for rn
<GOOD> Mm, but it depends
<GOOD> Because RPGs aren't *usually* my thing, I'm trying to get a handle on them
<GOOD> Pokemon is like, eh
<GOOD> I guess yeha
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I should actually continue SSS
<GOOD> I did Chucklehuck woods and stopped
<GOOD> I've heard Chrono Trigger is good
<GOOD> I just don't know if I should try RPGs if I don't like grinding because idk if there are ones out there that don't involve it
<GOOD> (Minus M&L)
<GOOD> I got that recommendation when I said I disliked P5R so I may try it
<GOOD> What's the SMT I should start on
<GOOD> I was gonna try more Earthbound but I heard it has a grinding/pacing issue at times
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I played for a while
<GOOD> It seems to involve lots of backtracking
<GOOD> Does DQ11 have grinding
<GOOD> I thought 11 was more modern
<GOOD> O you meant EB
<GOOD> I've never played a DQ
<GOOD> I've only played a Persona 5
<GOOD> Maybe I should look if there are any non persona RPGs on Game Pass
<GOOD> I also need that image
<GOOD> Also I'm ngl I can't name a single modern 2D RPG that doesn't look like Octopath like oml
<GOOD> Why are there so many Octopath looking games
<GOOD> I don't know many RPGs but there are a good few that are just the same artstyle like I get it looks pretty but mannn
<GOOD> What game
<GOOD> OH WAIT
<GOOD> CHRONO TRIGGER IS THAT TORIYAMA GAME
<GOOD> The art looks so pretty
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> The MC looks sooo sick
<GOOD> Even if he's got the GT Goku getup fr
<GOOD> I tried DD but I dislike permanent consequences in games (idc it just hinders my enjoyment)
<GOOD> Which is a shame because it looks so fun
<GOOD> At least Pikmin are easily recovered
<GOOD> Unfortunate bomb rock accidents
<GOOD> Arale what are you doing in Chrono Trigger
<GOOD> I like how basically all of them look
<GOOD> Especially frog, robot and MC fellow
<GOOD> Froge
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I may cop it too then
<GOOD> Chapter 3 of Celeste done
<GOOD> I downloaded Yakuza 0, Peggle and Guilty Gear Strive
<GOOD> (( my dinner is off by 1 day so I had to throw it out
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> I said it was off by 1 day
<GOOD> I can't eat it because it's starting to rot or whatever
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It went off
<GOOD> Chicken
<GOOD> I just threw it and went to the shop downstairs
<GOOD> It's more expensive but I need 3 meals so 2.50 it is
<GOOD> But man I'm mad at myself
<GOOD> It was just starting to come apart easy so I didn't chance it
<GOOD> We are officially done
<GOOD> I fought number 8 in the world for this fucking ribbon bro
<GOOD> Provided it has ribbons
<GOOD> I didn't even get it because it's just walking around and doesn't stay when moved out of HGSS
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I'm very very happy
<GOOD> Especially since I used Clay the most on my team
<GOOD> Uh, one sec
<GOOD> Colo
Emerald
Diamond
Heartgold
Black 2 but any Unova game is fine it's just for transfer
Y
OR
Moon
BD
PLA
Scarlet
<GOOD> If the pokemon goes into SwSh you need that too
<GOOD> And if it's a restricted legendary/mythical you need Ultra Sun/Moon instead
<GOOD> I emulated a few
<GOOD> It's about the effort not the money
<GOOD> Modded 3DS
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> You can make PKSM turn the pokemon into a QR code
<GOOD> *pkhex
<GOOD> Then PKSM on your 3DS can download it and place it in a different game
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Ursaluna looks more scared
<GOOD> I love her
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> Well that's only if the mon you wanna do is in those games
<GOOD> You can also use FRLG instead of Emerald
<GOOD> Or Ruby but there are upsides and downsides
<GOOD> Here's the chart if you need it
<GOOD> For shadow mons
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Everything in the centre square
<GOOD> And probably one or two more w the DLC
<GOOD> Prob others too
<GOOD> You can't make it Sneasler
<GOOD> Hisuian Sneasel exists
<GOOD> Tay pass
<GOOD> What the fuck is this
<GOOD> I'm in a chippy rn
<GOOD> Waiting to go to a pier to watch fireworks
<GOOD> I've never seen it
<GOOD> I have never been to a food court
<GOOD> Just had the best snack I've ever had
<GOOD> My flatmate came back w a ton of shit her mom baked and she gave me a square of her millionaire's shortbread
<GOOD> Holy FUCK
<GOOD> *tips hat* well reddited, fair internet user!
<GOOD> Thank you for downloading this because I hate downloading things from Twitter
<GOOD> I saw the post but couldn't download lmao
<GOOD> I mean I just post the videos because they're more convenient than looking through my bookmarks
<GOOD> Pibby!?!?!?
<GOOD> They gave me a thigh of fish
<GOOD> It was nice
<GOOD> Also I was the coldest I've ever been
<GOOD> I went out into like below 0 degree temperatures in a rain coat with no fleece, a short sleeved T shirt and joggers
<GOOD> And it was completely dark out and windy and I was on a pier overlooking the ocean lmao
<GOOD> I think my joints are aching from the cold
<GOOD> Is that a thing
<GOOD> What, I've never had it happen before
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> Fire
<GOOD> You are looking at the 77th best VGC player on the planet
<GOOD> (Trust that's how it works)
<GOOD> I also beat the number 8 player on ladder
<GOOD> Making me the 7th best player on the planet
<GOOD> Just got told by an online journal that AoT ended lmao
<GOOD> That hype is so gone
<GOOD> My joints are still hurting from the cold
<GOOD> It has been like an hour and a half in the warm lmao
<GOOD> The AI Dark Woody Toy Story mumble rap is stuck in my head
<GOOD> It's too funny to leave
<GOOD> It's whatever the fuck this is lmao
<GOOD> Chorus goes hard frfr
<GOOD> Shup up Buzz I'll kill you
<GOOD> It's funny as fuck
<GOOD> To me, Dark Toy Story is regular Toy Story...
<GOOD> I prefer just fixed jeans but I'm boring so
<GOOD> Jealous, I was wearing a coat and my upper arms and legs were getting frozen lmao
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> I wish I had a fashion sense
<GOOD> I just have a jacket, shirt and jeans combo
<GOOD> Always
<GOOD> I should use my favourite jacket as like, a badge/patch jacket
<GOOD> That would be neat I think
<GOOD> Unfortunately my fashion sense is shit so my favourite jacket is just
A green jacket
<GOOD> I'm perpetually dressed like this
<GOOD> I need help
<GOOD> The message in the end is that crocs will always be in style
<GOOD> I'm not a lesbian but I would date Adam Sandler
<GOOD> It seems like he knows how a GAMER thinks
<GOOD> I won't
<GOOD> Jk there are only a few men I find attractive raaagh
<GOOD> I have like 2 or 3 exceptions where they're attractive but I'm not attracted to them
<GOOD> Since I'm only attracted to women frfr
<GOOD> XBOX LIIIIVE
<GOOD> What is Lesbian Sunset
<GOOD> Is it different to the lesbian flag
<GOOD> I have never seen this in my life
<GOOD> I wonder if non binary people have a cool second flag
<GOOD> Though I'm already being greedy by using Agender and enby at the same time
<GOOD> I eated 2 flags
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I can't tell if this pain in my legs are from wearing my new boots or just from feeling the cold so badly it went into my bones
<GOOD> Sometimes when I walk/run for any extended amount of time one of the muscles in only one of my legs/feet go into agony and I have to limp
<GOOD> No idea why
<GOOD> No like
<GOOD> Always the same muscles
<GOOD> Same leg too
<GOOD> Idk how to identify anemia
<GOOD> And idk how to make my circulation rich
<GOOD> Their calves
<GOOD> And yeah it's always when strain is put on it
<GOOD> Like if I'm running or smth
<GOOD> I don't think I'm necessarily unfit, just weak lmao
<GOOD> Np it's happened with everyone at least once
<GOOD> ~~If you're unsure I have pronouns in the bio too~~
<GOOD> The agender flag is cool ngl
<GOOD> The green is like byooooom
<GOOD> When you said that the alien warbling noise from the ben 10 opening played in my head Spoon
<GOOD> That intro goes so hard
<GOOD> It started when an alien device did what it did
<GOOD> Yeah but like it's a REALLY nice green
<GOOD> I think I had one like that but with like clear plastic statues
<GOOD> But most flags I'm associated with are at least half one of those
<GOOD> I'm demigender and demiboy and then like, enby and agender
<GOOD> I should fr
<GOOD> I had so many ben 10 toys
<GOOD> Including like an alien with a brain and the entire purpose of the toy was that his brain was rubbery
<GOOD> And you just like, rubbed the brain ig
<GOOD> My favorite ben 10 alien was ripjaw and is now Upgrade
<GOOD> I love both of them tho
<GOOD> Upgrade is just following the trend of me fixating on 2 character archetypes:
Goopy fellas
Jesters
<GOOD> Idk I just like the enby flag
<GOOD> Even if yellow usually isn't my thing
<GOOD> Is he stu-
<GOOD> My relatable protag raaagh
<GOOD> It's coming back soon iirc
<GOOD> They closed the beta
<GOOD> Honestly the beta excuse is BS
<GOOD> The second you add microtransactions the game is not in beta
<GOOD> I kinda liked the movement tbh
<GOOD> Just got obnoxious they didn't actually balance the game
<GOOD> Bugs Bunny was fun af to play tho
<GOOD> My friend mained that thing
<GOOD> My other friend one tricked Iron Giant
<GOOD> Them adding the Gremlins was based tho
<GOOD> Well sometimes
<GOOD> The yellow in the enby flag is just ok
<GOOD> He liked being a ball
<GOOD> It prob won't be
<GOOD> I mean that sentence is coherent to me anyway
<GOOD> I spent too much money shopping
<GOOD> Do you want spice
<GOOD> Liked?
<GOOD> Yeah I'm aware
<GOOD> I might play it tomorrow
<GOOD> It says it's a Demo
<GOOD> I downloaded the wrong ROM probably
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Scott Pilgrim
<GOOD> It occurs to me that I haven't actually beaten a new game in a while minus SM Wonder
<GOOD> I mean I think I have superhero fatigue because there's genuinely just so much oversaturation from Marvel
<GOOD> And the shitty movie fatigue turns into superhero fatigue
<GOOD> I liked The Batman
<GOOD> Not enough to watch it again but I liked it
<GOOD> And I've never watched a Batman movie before so
<GOOD> Wait does Lego Batman movie count because that one went hard fr
<GOOD> Ngl I watched the whole thing and don't remember anything about it
<GOOD> Loki was a tiny bit more memorable, I liked Wandavision simply because of the idea
<GOOD> I think Wandavision is one of the best series they've made which isn't a high bar but still
<GOOD> Hai Obie
<GOOD> I think the last one I watched that was super deflating was Dr Strange 2 which kinda sucks because it was probably decent
<GOOD> I just got tired of how much they were pushing out
<GOOD> Eepy
<GOOD> Also deciding if I'm being a dumbass for thinking this CRT filter on my emulator looks better
<GOOD> I have that so retro... vibe rn
<GOOD> I'm playing this for the first time after my lecture
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> I am 18
<GOOD> I just wasn't interested in DC
<GOOD> Or superheroes in general for a long time
<GOOD> That one with Captain America was the worst I watched
<GOOD> I forgot the name
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I don't think I've ever read a romance novel or whatever
<GOOD> Idk why but that sorta stuff has never once caught my attention
<GOOD> I don't think a single romance subplot has ever interested me somehow
<GOOD> Like I've never been like I hope they end up together, it's can I get back to the rest of the story please
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> Probably why I haven't read a romance novel
<GOOD> I just wish I liked more things in general x_x
<GOOD> I feel like such a contrarian lol
<GOOD> Sounds neat
<GOOD> Idk why I try so hard to enjoy things I probably won't tho
<GOOD> Oh wait I was invested in 1 romance subplot in a show but it was like, not even a B plot in a comedy anime
<GOOD> Like it had about as much time per episode as a particularly long Family Guy cutaway
<GOOD> I think this is just one of my more spontaneous try what other people like things because I don't really feel interest towards the synopses
<GOOD> Ty for trying though
<GOOD> Yeah but there are some things where even on a surface level I just don't like, understand
<GOOD> It's not a fault of anyone but myself but wrapping my head around why it's interesting constantly happens
<GOOD> Like I see the romance quotes and I'm just like completely stone faced and confused for no real reason
<GOOD> I mean I've only experienced actual romance for like a week ever
<GOOD> And that was crappy
<GOOD> Maybe I'm just dissociated from the idea of it? Idk
<GOOD> The only things that resonate emotionally with me in shows are people getting absolutely fucked over by the world in general and being miserable lmao
<GOOD> And dogs dying because that's basically a free opportunity to make me cry
<GOOD> Yeah but like they have decent endings
<GOOD> For whatever reason the biggest impacts shows have had on me are where the protagonists are fucking miserable and then continue to be absolutely destroyed for the entire story with mild optimism thrown in
<GOOD> Like in Berserk the MC is just tortured for like 300 chapters and it's probably one of the most motivating stories I've ever read
<GOOD> Oh and Cowboy Bebop where the MC is basically just stagnating in life for the entire show and then at the end ||he dies after killing someone out of spite||
<GOOD> That one changed my life tho
<GOOD> It's fine, I think I'll stick with close-knit friendships instead of romance for a while longer
<GOOD> Because that's absolutely where I feel comfiest
<GOOD> Just a bunch of people as close as family
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Idk why romance confuses me so much ffs
<GOOD> I'm not aro or anything I literally just don't understand it
<GOOD> Yeah but surely the base concept of watching a relationship happen should appeal to me
<GOOD> Or at least understand why it is appealing
<GOOD> No idea
<GOOD> Like I can barely understand how romance works
<GOOD> I'm not in love rn but sometimes I misplace platonic love with romantic ones
<GOOD> And that's annoying
<GOOD> Because it definitely isn't the case my brain is just fucky
<GOOD> Also I think I would probably crumble under the emotional responsibility of a 2nd person x_x
<GOOD> I already worry enough about my friends lmao
<GOOD> I'm aware, I just summated it in a brief way for someone that's never seen it
<GOOD> Well I assume
<GOOD> Cowboy Bebop is an emotionally rich show constantly so just a quick look over is bound to miss stuff
<GOOD> That's sick, but why not ink?
<GOOD> Dude they should add that, the game would go viral
<GOOD> Also I thought John Pork was there
<GOOD> It shoots minecraft blocks
<GOOD> I've started playing SMRPG
<GOOD> Yeah I'm playing this instead
<GOOD> Because the remake is too pricey rn
<GOOD> Ye and I just bought Wonder so
<GOOD> Oh the slapstick in this game is already hilarious
<GOOD> Jus like Mario and Luigi
<GOOD> Dude they should totally add him, the game would go viral
<GOOD> Because I forgot my bazooka at home
<GOOD> Hai Rosis
<GOOD> Rosie
<GOOD> And Obie
<GOOD> Warm and cozy
<GOOD> Duuuude
<GOOD> Why am I so bad at this game
<GOOD> I already lost to the first boss :((
<GOOD> I forgot how bad at RPGs I am
<GOOD> I can't even get basic things like timing
<GOOD> I get almost downed almost every encounter
<GOOD> Ok I had to spam items to live
<GOOD> That wasn't good
<GOOD> I had to use 4 damn mushrooms
<GOOD> ~~I still don't think I've felt it~~
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> Just mushrooms
<GOOD> Is there some reason why Mallow is doing 1 damage with crits
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Sometimes 2
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It does 2 when I time it well
<GOOD> If not it does 1
<GOOD> Meanwhile Mario is doing above 20
<GOOD> But his magic attacks do very little and drain very fast
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Ok so how do I restore it
<GOOD> I didn't realise there was timing for thunderbolt
<GOOD> But the screen has flashed basically every time
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Like that
<GOOD> Not sure I haven't been paying attention
<GOOD> Also, do I just use the flower tabs now
<GOOD> To increase my FP
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Also I beat Mack
<GOOD> Should I be using thunderbolt in random encounters?
<GOOD> Yeah I stocked up on a few
<GOOD> Bro this mimic isn't fucking around
<GOOD> Wtf
<GOOD> Can I block text attacks
<GOOD> Like ones that have a name
<GOOD> Psychopath???
<GOOD> I'm not playing the remaster so idk
<GOOD> Oh thank fuck
<GOOD> I thought I'd be blindly attacking
<GOOD> Oh you can change what normal attacks you get?
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I got the cool shell
<GOOD> I mean I just got a card for a juice club
<GOOD> Or smth
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I do not understand this
<GOOD> I'm trying to yoshi race but it doesn't make sense
<GOOD> Nvm I sorta get it?
<GOOD> 3 stars down
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> Idk whether to use Bowser or Geno
<GOOD> What makes him so good
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I haven't gotten the Geno boost yet and can't get the hang of his pellet gun attack timing
<GOOD> Plus I'm doing ~60 damage with geno cannon and idk if I'm charging it wrong
<GOOD> Geno Cannon is like the ability
<GOOD> And the pellet gun is just one of his weapons I picked up I forgot the name
<GOOD> I also can't tell when it crits
<GOOD> Test
<GOOD> Is anyone else's DC shitting itself or just me
<GOOD> Yeah it is
<GOOD> Sorry my entire discord disconnected for that whole time
<GOOD> Ok my damage was just being low
<GOOD> I see what you mean now by Geno being the best tho I unlocked his boost
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I just spent a lot of money in Marrymore lmao
<GOOD> Like, almost everything I have
<GOOD> I bought the SUITE
<GOOD> Oh and new armour and weapons
<GOOD> 4 stars down
<GOOD> We almost there
<GOOD> Nuh uh I would be the Pegasus
<GOOD> Oooo I'm going to the ocean
<GOOD> Might give uo
<GOOD> Nvm did it by accident
<GOOD> The game is starting to get annoying now
<GOOD> DUDE
<GOOD> Every encounter is so damn hard wtf
<GOOD> Like I'm almost facing a teamwipe every fucking fight
<GOOD> Ugh and this letter puzzle
<GOOD> It should be easy but ofc they have to make it cryptic and long winded
<GOOD> Not if it continues like this
<GOOD> I almost get teamwiped every turn of every battle
<GOOD> I have the best equipment, they just decide to dump all their abilities into 1 slot
<GOOD> And burn my items
<GOOD> Or spam status moves like Elegy and S'Crow/Mush Funk
<GOOD> Or Deathsickle
<GOOD> In the Koro sewers?
<GOOD> Yes, I did
<GOOD> And the form retention thing only works on 1 party member
<GOOD> So they can just funnel damaging abilities into Toadstool to down her in 1 turn, use Elegy on the formchange person, then use Formchange on the unprotected one
<GOOD> Pretty much but she's equal to the rest of the party
<GOOD> Frail as fuck though
<GOOD> The sunken ship
<GOOD> And it doesn't even matter because I did all the rooms and yet I'm too stupid to figure out a puzzle in a children's game
<GOOD> If Toadstool isn't there I don't have enough healing to offset the ludicrous DPS the enemies have
<GOOD> Because I'll usually be fighting 4 or even 5 enemies
<GOOD> Some doing upwards of 40 damage a turn on a failed block or someone hit by Deathsickle
<GOOD> And they never explain that which is great
<GOOD> I give up man they're just gonna keep draining my supplies until I run out
<GOOD> I have no idea why the spike is so ridiculous here but it's annoying af
<GOOD> 10 across the board
<GOOD> And how am I meant to KNOW
<GOOD> Like a tiny bit of communication of this would have helped
<GOOD> Well I'm too pissed off to waste my time grinding so I give
<GOOD> Wasn't aware the game was into wasting my fucking time even after I intentionally fought most enemies I came across
<GOOD> I have 0 idea how to get that armour
<GOOD> I have no money because I spent it on happy gear and upgrades, I have nothing to sell because I'm a fucking tool and sold old equipment
<GOOD> Well idk how to get it
<GOOD> I already explored but with every room being completely packed with the most frantic NPCs possible it was a tiny, *tiny* bit inconvenient
<GOOD> Like idk why there are so many enemies all of a sudden either
<GOOD> And every single fight has 5 enemies or so each and it's ughhhhh
<GOOD> Idrk what to do
<GOOD> I just wish this was communicated at all
<GOOD> Like yeah ghosts are weak to lightning that checks out
<GOOD> And I have no idea if I'm underlevelled or not because the enemies don't have levels
<GOOD> Welp, I've hit the burnout point
<GOOD> Ffs this always happens
<GOOD> This always happens
<GOOD> It happens every time with a game tho
<GOOD> I hit a point where the game is mildly annoying and give up
<GOOD> Because it gets boring or frustrating
<GOOD> The music has been good
<GOOD> I'm just really annoyed
<GOOD> Maybe I'm just not an RPG person or smth
<GOOD> I have liked the game up to thos point
<GOOD> I'm just super fucking annoyed because for whatever reason this area is much more annoying than the others
<GOOD> More enemies both in the overworld and in battles, moving in more frantic patterns, spamming more annoying status more often and doing more damage
<GOOD> And the really slow puzzle was just what sent me over
<GOOD> There's no guidance though
<GOOD> I can't tell the difference between the area is meant to be this hard and you aren't using the right strategy
<GOOD> If there were levels or a way to identify weaknesses or anything like that I'd be like yeah ok that checks out
<GOOD> But psychopath doesn't identify weaknesses or level
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> Why is that not just a regular fucking input
<GOOD> It does not ever convey that it needs to be done
<GOOD> Or when you have to time it
<GOOD> Or whether it works, or what it reveals
<GOOD> That's my issue, they aren't explaining anything to me
<GOOD> Yeah, and they didn't say it was on every move
<GOOD> Or whether psychopath had one, or anything like when the input is
<GOOD> And that's conveyed to me how
<GOOD> Without them telling me non damaging abilities have timed inputs
<GOOD> But only some non damaging abilities since I doubt healing specials have inputs like that
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> Why are they so variable then
<GOOD> Genuinely don't know how I was meant to figure that out apart from just mashing Y
<GOOD> I haven't even been able to find the move descriptions
<GOOD> I assumed it didn't have any since I pressed start on the moves themselves and nothing happened
<GOOD> That's my ISSUE tho
<GOOD> Like just convey things instead of hiding the explanation and everything
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> I'm just so mad at this
<GOOD> Like, to realise I was underlevelled, there was no actual way to know
<GOOD> And to realise I was using the wrong element, I'd have to bring a character I wasn't using, and use a move I use often, but do something with it I wasn't aware of to reveal a mechanic I wasn't aware of
<GOOD> Like just fucking
<GOOD> BE TRANSPARENT
<GOOD> Yeah, because it tells you what things do believe it or not
<GOOD> And you can infer what something will be weak to
<GOOD> It is actually made to not fight against the player
<GOOD> What, is every other RPG like this too?
<GOOD> I just wish that something would actually be straightforward
<GOOD> The *older* pokemon games had this
<GOOD> Like you could just check a move and it would say what it does
<GOOD> Even mid battle
<GOOD> Every time I attempted to use Psychopath I just ended up pressing it after the symbol flash
<GOOD> Because it never conveyed that I was doing it right or wrong
<GOOD> And yet describing what a move does was a standard
<GOOD> They shouldn't be buried there tho
<GOOD> Like the start button is never even used
<GOOD> It doesn't pause the game, no
<GOOD> The X button pulls up the manu
<GOOD> Menu
<GOOD> The start and select buttons, to my knowledge don't actually do anything
<GOOD> Idk I'm sorry
<GOOD> It just really annoys me that I'm getting angry at a genuinely fun and good game
<GOOD> Because of issues I can't control because of dated game practices
<GOOD> I doubt I can get out of the ship
<GOOD> There's so many enemies
<GOOD> And I can't dodge them
<GOOD> (Also idk why but Mallow's damage is fucking awful it's why I benched him)
<GOOD> And I've probably been buffing the wrong stats
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> I suck at RPGs
<GOOD> Oh wait I'm fucking stupid
<GOOD> I could be spamming pure water rn
<GOOD> I'M SO STUPID
<GOOD> I AVOIDED THAT ROBED GUY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEH WERE AN ENEMY
<GOOD> Ok I have no issue with this anymore
<GOOD> I'm just inexcusably stupid
<GOOD> Nah I'm enjoying it after tagging in Mallow
<GOOD> Ok I'm glad I found this dude
<GOOD> My main issue was that there wasn't a vendor down here
<GOOD> Ok so:
6 letters
Has an S
2 vowels, 4 consonants
2 consonants are next to each other
<GOOD> And it's on the ocean floor
<GOOD> I was gonna put squids but it wouldn't let me
<GOOD> I'm just really really stupid
<GOOD> None of my options have 2 vowels
<GOOD> Am I missing a hint or something?
<GOOD> Bruh
<GOOD> I keep thinking of squids, crabs, fishes etc
<GOOD> I don't know
<GOOD> Plenty of fuckin things are found on the bottom of the sea
<GOOD> Well can't be snails either
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> Or slugs
<GOOD> So all the crustaceans and molluscs I know are out
<GOOD> I'm just sitting and thinking
<GOOD> Everything I think of doesn't fit
<GOOD> Octopi doesn't work either
<GOOD> Why is this so nonspecificccc
<GOOD> It's on the bottom of the ocean isn't a hint there are so many things there
<GOOD> I feel so dumb
<GOOD> It's making me sad
<GOOD> This is a basic question
<GOOD> And I am taking marine biology at uni
<GOOD> And I still can't get a basic question right
<GOOD> I already have a hiny
<GOOD> Hint
<GOOD> It's found on the bottom of the ocean, 6 letters long (or 5 because it's probably plural), has an S (or not because it's probably plural), 2 vowels, 4 consonants (or 3)
<GOOD> I hate how half of the hints fall apart when there's the possibility of plurals
<GOOD> I am going fo
<GOOD> I can't even say it here
<GOOD> Nah man that wasn't even a good answer
<GOOD> What the fuck
<GOOD> I'm not even saying it because I'm bad, that wasn't a good puzzle
<GOOD> Because it's not even true
<GOOD> Yeah I'm not even happy about that man
<GOOD> It's just false tho
<GOOD> Pearls are found fairly high up, they aren't found on the bottom of the ocean
<GOOD> I'm not even regretting it this time that puzzle just wasn't good
<GOOD> And yet pearls aren't found on the ocean floor
<GOOD> They're found inside clams
<GOOD> And only sometimes, and usually it's not that far down
<GOOD> And saying it has an S is pointless if it's plural
<GOOD> So yes, but sparsely
<GOOD> And pearls are exceedingly rare anyway
<GOOD> Pearls was the answer tho
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Doesn't let you
<GOOD> No but that puzzle was probably the lowest point so far
<GOOD> Because the rest has been good
<GOOD> >pearl oysters
<GOOD> That isn't a fact
<GOOD> Coral is 5 letters
<GOOD> Also considering there's a squid below deck wouldn't squids be the best answer
<GOOD> Anyway I'm not angry but that puzzle just wasn't good
<GOOD> At least the rest of the game has been amazing so far
<GOOD> Geno is carrying me so hard rn
<GOOD> I actually just adore his design tbh
<GOOD> His arm cannon is sick
<GOOD> Also dipper idk what to do
<GOOD> I can't psychopath King Calamari because I can't see the lights
<GOOD> Nvm I found a solution (kill)
<GOOD> I did like 400 damage with 2 people
<GOOD> Also is Geno Boost permanent
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is it stackable?
<GOOD> I landed Psychopath+ on an enemy but it just told me it wants to go home
<GOOD> Dude wtf
<GOOD> I can't beat this fucking mimic
<GOOD> Why so broken
<GOOD> I beat it
<GOOD> Just required a lot of buffing
<GOOD> And using Toadstool
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It was such a slow burn tho the mimics are busted af
<GOOD> No levels in SMRPG
<GOOD> This game lmao
<GOOD> And SM64 yes
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> But her name in the actual screen is Toadstool in SMRPG
<GOOD> I love how fun the humour is
<GOOD> Hello and goodnight
<GOOD> This door is one of the few things I knew about the game going in
<GOOD> I don't know how to unlock this door but I'll figure it out later
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> I think I'm almost done with this game tbh
<GOOD> Well unless I have to grind for Culex after the game is over
<GOOD> Hey I've had that for a while just not in my sleep (and maybe not induced by my chicken addiction)
<GOOD> I really wanna fight Culex
<GOOD> Haiii
<GOOD> I love the shark
<GOOD> I'm jealous of Willow's cool hair
<GOOD> Mine just goes fluffy after shampoo and a shower
<GOOD> I don't splurge for conditioner and don't know how to use it
<GOOD> So what I have is enough
<GOOD> I am incredibly stingy with things I don't need
<GOOD> I need better face wash tbh
<GOOD> Mine floofs
<GOOD> I wish I didn't shed tho lmao
<GOOD> That gets annoying
<GOOD> I should be able to finish SMRPG today
<GOOD> 5 of 7 star shards
<GOOD> He's so cool bro
<GOOD> It's neat
<GOOD> Yeah again
<GOOD> Annoying af
<GOOD> I haven't heard anything of it
<GOOD> Depends on what the remake adds
<GOOD> Seems like a pretty good one
<GOOD> Honestly the 2 big additions I've seen are great
<GOOD> For SMRPG
<GOOD> Like the coolest things I could have asked for
<GOOD> It's a good level
<GOOD> Burned like 30 lives on it
<GOOD> I don't think it's a fault of the game that you played Celeste before it
<GOOD> Like there has to be some way for a child to beat it
<GOOD> This is a challenge lol
<GOOD> Badge run is probably already pushing to mid to late super meat boy levels in terms of how hard it is
<GOOD> Conveyor isn't really a boss
<GOOD> But what issues do you have with the level design
<GOOD> Someone beat me to it
<GOOD> I mean it's a Mario game
<GOOD> At the very baseline you play as Mario in it
<GOOD> The themes, gimmicks etc of each level shake it up with diff locations, enemies and gimmicks
<GOOD> Like the ice level themed around outmaways
<GOOD> Or the bullrush one
<GOOD> Or the one that's entirely at sunset and silhouetted, or the desert puzzle
<GOOD> That's probably like, the purpose
<GOOD> The long enemies were made for the level as the gimmick
<GOOD> Since the silhouettes obscure whether they're short or long
<GOOD> Then you must not have liked the invisibility sections lmao
<GOOD> Also there was an issue with where the people were?
<GOOD> I don't think I ever experienced an issue with that level and seeing things lol
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I played as Blue Toad lol I knoe that
<GOOD> I still didn't have issues
<GOOD> Yeah but like, some of the level design criticisms are just that it's Mario
<GOOD> And not some other character with different movement
<GOOD> Yeah that's why Wonder only has secret hard levels
<GOOD> 64 is worse
<GOOD> My timing in SMRPG is getting better
<GOOD> I was fighting the sensei dude
<GOOD> I beat him twice but I'm not ready for the 3rd battle
<GOOD> Yeah because that's where the sensei is lol
<GOOD> I'm actually in the nimbus village rm
<GOOD> Rn
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I also found the flag guys
<GOOD> I already know what's behind the door
<GOOD> It's 1 of 2 things I knew going in
<GOOD> I'll do it later
<GOOD> No I'm getting 2 more star shards
<GOOD> Also I lost at captain John once womp womp
<GOOD> I didn't expect his gimmick
<GOOD> Also I don't understand why some specials say tilt your controller
<GOOD> Terrorize and Peach's Sleep ability
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That's a bit unintuitive
<GOOD> Emulated
<GOOD> Yeah but my controller has a p accurate dpad
<GOOD> So I'm oki
<GOOD> Was a very annoying process because it was non-injected emu Emerald to injected emu Diamond
<GOOD> Although on hardware I think it's just Pal Park
<GOOD> Because PKSM can't interact with injected saves afaik
<GOOD> You could extract the sav from the SD card
<GOOD> Then edit the mon in
<GOOD> I hear NASB 2 is a bit buggy on release but that's to be expected
<GOOD> Hiya
<GOOD> Sea of Thieves is real peak
<GOOD> Also is this what Fire Emblem is like
<GOOD> Are the old fire emblems good
<GOOD> Or is it best to start at the newer smoother ones
<GOOD> I played it w my dad and friends often
<GOOD> Oh also Dipper I beat that queen lady up
<GOOD> Not much more progress because I just wanted to watch a video tonight
<GOOD> One Piece reference
<GOOD> Oh I absolutely love the game that puzzle and area was just annoying me
<GOOD> I'm still saying that the puzzle was a bit dumb
<GOOD> Also I got Geno Blast
<GOOD> I can see Mario and Luigi far more than Paper Mario
<GOOD> It's very expensive
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I just haven't used it because I don't understand it
<GOOD> In fact I just realised I haven't been looking for the timing on Geno Blast
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That's funny
<GOOD> Oh I love Geno ik
<GOOD> He's one of my favourite designed Nintendo fellas
<GOOD> Also I'm ngl because of the filter, I think that I won't buy the remake for a whike
<GOOD> The almost grimy(?) Aesthetic of some areas in the original is so cool
<GOOD> It has a really specific mood that I can't put my finger on
<GOOD> Intentional or not
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I was pressing it as it connected
<GOOD> I may not use it
<GOOD> It seems unfair
<GOOD> My favorite backdrop for a fight so far has been this
<GOOD> Sick af boss design too
<GOOD> I also love how every area and fight is like a little diorama
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Idk if she comes back but I stopped after I reunited Mallow and his parents
<GOOD> I absolutely loved that segment lmao
<GOOD> That and the Booster scene didn't overstay their welcome
<GOOD> And they were funny as fuck
<GOOD> It's been a long, long, LONG time since a game I've played got genuine belly laughs out of me
<GOOD> Mm
<GOOD> I'm unfortunately not copping the remake for a while
<GOOD> I think I'm just gonna start savings for Switch 2
<GOOD> Honestly idk how they'll top 8D
<GOOD> There aren't really many more meaningful gimmicks to add
<GOOD> I think I'll play Chrono Trigger after SMRPG
<GOOD> Are there any other traditional RPGs with like active battle systems like the timing one in the Mario RPGs
<GOOD> I got the geno whirl input first try
<GOOD> I wish I'd bought the Run item
<GOOD> I'm in the volcano nwo
<GOOD> Hi chat I almost have 6 star pieces
<GOOD> Duuuuude why couldn't this fire drill have been at like, 5pm
<GOOD> It's 1am yahoo
<GOOD> And our building nearly failed and had to do it again but we didn't so that's great
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Now I have stomach cramps
<GOOD> Yay
<GOOD> This has been a bad day
<GOOD> Actually tomorrow is pretty chill I just have 1 lecture preventing me from slobbing around my flat the whole day
<GOOD> I may also do laundry if I can figure out how
<GOOD> I usually sprint when I leave the room with something cooking
<GOOD> I never leave for more than like a minute even if I'm heating up water lol
<GOOD> I cooked a chicken thigh today w southern fried seasoning
<GOOD> Very yummy
<GOOD> Anyway imma slep
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Yay I beat the Axem rangers
<GOOD> Enby ppl are trans
<GOOD> So could be
<GOOD> Wait that's what the media default of nonbinary looks like?
<GOOD> I don't think it's really avoidable to make a character that is non binary look androgynous, like they look awesome af
<GOOD> It isn't required but OW appeals to the majority of the audience the character is from
<GOOD> Like mid length hair and baggy clothes is just what people wear
<GOOD> Also why do they have a giant drill
<GOOD> Is that what's happening?
<GOOD> Idk I just never got the vibe that Overwatch was attempting to marginalise with this design
<GOOD> Like I don't think it's they're non binary, so they must be x, it's they're non binary and this is their design
<GOOD> Looks sick tbh
<GOOD> I mean until now our enby representation in OW was fucking Bastion so I'm just glad to have a second one
<GOOD> New OW lore, non binary code
<GOOD> I didn't ask for more I was just like wow this character is awesome and also enby
<GOOD> Like this is one of my favourite OW character designs
<GOOD> Even if they look like a guilty gear character
<GOOD> Well they don't have a gender
<GOOD> Yeah and I fw that
<GOOD> Bastion and Zen were both my mains and favourite characters in OW
<GOOD> (Also I was under the impression a character without a gender is agender)
<GOOD> I mean the other robots chose genders
<GOOD> It isn't out of the question that Bastion chose to not be bothered
<GOOD> Like their intelligence isn't any lower than the rest of the cast apart from those that are exceedingly smart as far as we know
<GOOD> It has 1 hand
<GOOD> Anyway this enby mf is awesome
<GOOD> I wish I was a cool enby in a giant coat with moon boots and a drill
<GOOD> Also I may as well headcanon bastion as enby because while I'm not asking for crumbs I'll certainly take what I can get
<GOOD> What isn't
<GOOD> Asking for crumbs or headcanoning
<GOOD> Junko wishes they could be Damon Gant
<GOOD> Fuuuuuck I'm stupid
<GOOD> I committed to a long term project for my course but I came into the lecture today and they were like you probably shouldn't pick yet
<GOOD> And I can't take it back
<GOOD> Even if it's rlly cool I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to do iy
<GOOD> There's like, a hypothesis/pitch I have to make for the project
<GOOD> So I can decide if it's right for me
<GOOD> Tbf I was only gonna pick 1 of 2 subjects anyway
<GOOD> One was about apex predators and one was about ocean toxins
<GOOD> And I chose toxins
<GOOD> I thought you didn't like mid games
<GOOD> Anyway I'm just kinda worried now
<GOOD> Because I jumped the gun
<GOOD> At least ocean toxins are awesome
<GOOD> Apex
<GOOD> Ugh I feel ill
<GOOD> I haven't felt work stress in a while
<GOOD> Do we know anything about Venture's kit btw
<GOOD> This laundry service is a fucking circus
<GOOD> They never bothered to tell us we could get a card, when I looked all the cards were gone, and now apparently the only way to fucking use it is to contact the company itself (with notoriously horrific customer support) and ask for another method
<GOOD> Like holy fucking shit
<GOOD> I hate this
<GOOD> I'm so mad man why does random bullshit have to constantly fuck with me
<GOOD> My eyes hurt
<GOOD> NOOOOO
<GOOD> They made his hitboxes honest
<GOOD> Fuck man
<GOOD> I don't have the motivation to go do laundry but I have to
<GOOD> Hello Rosie
<GOOD> Fucksake
<GOOD> My tabs all closed because I turned off my PC wrong
<GOOD> Hru
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Dogshit
<GOOD> I just want a day to not fuck me over man
<GOOD> It's so annoying
<GOOD> I'm not in the mood for shitposts or whatever
<GOOD> I just wanna spend today moping tbh
<GOOD> Actually yeah fuck it I'm cancelling my plans
<GOOD> I am aware, I used to exercise very very often
<GOOD> I just physically can't make myself leave my flat today
<GOOD> I mean this isn't really that
<GOOD> I'm locking myself in my room and moping while doing work
<GOOD> I'm basically just being lazy tbh
<GOOD> My mom wants me to go to the gaming society today to get an hour out but like
<GOOD> I'm barely staying sitting in my chair rn
<GOOD> ~~And tbh just sitting here is also stressing me out because I'm not working~~
<GOOD> Wow fr?
<GOOD> I have restored most of my tabs
<GOOD> But the one that has my ribbon masters is just gone I think
<GOOD> Nvm apparently it saves online rather than client side
<GOOD> She pretty
<GOOD> Mewtwo is yucky tho especially in Unite
<GOOD> Mewtwo is the only champ I've seen that has broken the game on its release twice
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Oh I lost some SMRPG progress
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Creature
<GOOD> I should try Mega Man at some point
<GOOD> I've only ever played Mega Man 1
<GOOD> Frye getting fucked over again lmao
<GOOD> Nothing new
<GOOD> Your go to is a fist bump?
<GOOD> I don't think I've fist bumped anyone in my life
<GOOD> Like a high five maybe
<GOOD> Why are the 3 images identical
<GOOD> Is it sponsored or smth?
<GOOD> Also what's the filling
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Bean paste
<GOOD> I'm not a fan of red bean paste ngl, kinda sucks that I dislike it
<GOOD> Also I lost Mario RPG progress :((
<GOOD> Only about 20 to 30 minutes
<GOOD> I did some trials in Bowser's Castle before realising I couldn't go back and save and I had a lecture
<GOOD> And BSNES wouldn't close properly and wouldn't make save states and when I put my PC in sleep mode it just stopped
<GOOD> This also means I un-got the Star Gun
<GOOD> Also, I got both the Lazy Shells and Frying Pan because I can't be bothered to complain anymore
<GOOD> And the mystery egg, even though it's even more cryptic
<GOOD> But look at this it's your own sense of mortality
<GOOD> The Mystery Egg makes me mad but it's inconsequential so
<GOOD> I don't really care enough to actually be angry
<GOOD> I also bought that other item I forgot what it was
<GOOD> Oh right the lucky thing
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I just can't be bothered to hatch it because that's a really dumb way to unlock an item
<GOOD> Why wasn't it just use it 10 times in 1 battle
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> You use it 48 times for some reason
<GOOD> It's really annoying that it exists but I don't need it so idc
<GOOD> Is there anything else like that that I should know about
<GOOD> That I would never get in normal gameplay
<GOOD> Specifically anything worth getting
<GOOD> Not the hidden blocks
<GOOD> Really broken
<GOOD> Oh hey I found that NPC
<GOOD> I've gotten like 10(?) To 15 jumps
<GOOD> Coincidence that these are on the same day???
<GOOD> Oh so we're at that section in Mario RPG
<GOOD> Unfortunate but had to happen eventually
<GOOD> The section every old game has where you're just like oh I have to play this section
<GOOD> Basically this section has 6 doors that lead to different challenges, and you have to do 4 to get through
<GOOD> One is 2D Isometric platforming in a game with very little depth perception, one is fighting through like 12 battles per door, and one is random and weirdly annoying puzzles
<GOOD> Like there's one that's just a trivia section that asks about completely inconsequential NPC dialogue that you may not have even interacted with or remember
<GOOD> And asks about things you shouldn't know by this point in most circumstances
<GOOD> It's one of those sections
<GOOD> Where on a revisit you're like oh man this part? I don't wanna play this part
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Only comparison I can draw is like, water levels ig
<GOOD> Yeah p much
<GOOD> It has a bunch of random previously never done games in a row
<GOOD> Which would be fine if you couldn't fail one of them by just playing a game they made up wrong
<GOOD> Or fighting a long gauntlet of pushover enemies
<GOOD> Dragon Quest characters with the fade???
<GOOD> Oh right
<GOOD> I played like 5 minutes of that once as a kid
<GOOD> Ok I'm gonna say one genuine issue I have with SMRPG
<GOOD> The isometric platforming is REAAAALLY janky
<GOOD> At least to me
<GOOD> in the final boss rn
<GOOD> Second phase
<GOOD> It's going well
<GOOD> He has so much health
<GOOD> Maybe not the place
<GOOD> Yeah we hate this dude he's a complete tool, but like some shit doesn't belong here
<GOOD> finished
<GOOD> What does Humble Choice actually give you
<GOOD> Just discounts?
<GOOD> Mario RPG?
<GOOD> Oh wait that's later this month nvm
<GOOD> Bro they holding a Tenkaichi Budokai
<GOOD> Ohhh right
<GOOD> I can't play tomorrow because lectures but I'm hyped
<GOOD> I need to learn heavyweights
<GOOD> So I can actually play Funky
<GOOD> It also just means we have basically every racer from old games back
<GOOD> Minus like, Rosalina and ROB
<GOOD> Wait
<GOOD> We have Rosa nvm
<GOOD> Fun game
<GOOD> The final boss was rlly stressful tho
<GOOD> My biggest and probably only real complaint with the game is how poor and wonky the platforming is
<GOOD> It can be suuuuper hard to see where you're going
<GOOD> 1am here
<GOOD> Same for UK
<GOOD> Anyway that was a fun final boss
<GOOD> Though I still don't understand some mechanics
<GOOD> And there were some parts that were really hard in it
<GOOD> Like when he just flat out downed 2 buffed up party members
<GOOD> Final boss in Super Mario RPG
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> Rn I'm just staring at a star
<GOOD> And it says THE END
<GOOD> But idk when this is meant to like, end
<GOOD> It's been like this for a few minutes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Ok so like what do I do
<GOOD> Can I like, leave yet
<GOOD> This star keeps playing Mario music
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I'll probably grind to lv 30 then go fight Culex
<GOOD> Not tonight tho
<GOOD> No like this isn't even a skip there isn't a postgame lmao
<GOOD> Ngl I would have kept sitting there
<GOOD> I almost believed you just now
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> The final few fights were a bit of a slog but it's to be expected
<GOOD> Goes hard but most of the songs do
<GOOD> Not sure what my favourite boss was tbh
<GOOD> I liked the Axem Rangers
<GOOD> How do I grind for Culex
<GOOD> I was spamming group hug
<GOOD> And Mario wasn't threatened until phase 2 Smithy
<GOOD> 21
<GOOD> I don't really want to take him at this level
<GOOD> I struggled with Smithy
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I thought it was only for Mario
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Probably should have given it to Peach
<GOOD> Drops attack for a ludicrous DEF increase
<GOOD> I doubt it
<GOOD> It doesn't seem to
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't like, know how healing scales
<GOOD> A bit
<GOOD> I wasn't aware healing scaled off magic attack
<GOOD> I've already played Dream Team, Paper Jam and a bit of SSS
<GOOD> Dream Team was good
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Also this fucker is scary
<GOOD> I ain't ready
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> Why would it be on ios
<GOOD> Not really no
<GOOD> Ok then
<GOOD> I wonder if I need the Super Jump armour
<GOOD> Again I struggled with Smithy
<GOOD> And he is harder
<GOOD> I'm unsure if I have the exp booster
<GOOD> Or the frog coins for it
<GOOD> I have 21 rn
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Idk where to get one
<GOOD> Absolutely a shitpost
<GOOD> I honestly don't know how to beat him
<GOOD> Like ik he has crystals
<GOOD> SMB2
<GOOD> Wait that's the wrong name
<GOOD> NSMB2
<GOOD> 2 is just not that good
<GOOD> The gimmick just being wowie coins!!!! Meant it lacked... anything
<GOOD> Perfume is awesome
<GOOD> Smells nice when there's not too much
<GOOD> Nah I'm killing Culex then playing Chrono Trigger
<GOOD> Paper Mario but bug
<GOOD> HOLY SHIT
<GOOD> WE WILL BE THERE NO MATTER WHAT
<GOOD> Learnt that the hard way
<GOOD> I had it on Peach and she died to Fear Roulette
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> They're fine here tbh
<GOOD> You always plan for being fucked up in a bad turn
<GOOD> You can't block most of them
<GOOD> Like Scythe
<GOOD> It's almost like they should make it clear what is and isn't blockable in game
<GOOD> My friend wears braces too, it sounds like it sucks :/
<GOOD> Glad you've settled into them a bit
<GOOD> I've only had to wear a cast or whatever
<GOOD> A foot brace?
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Well the game is over now lmao
<GOOD> Apart from Culex but idk what attacks he has
<GOOD> Oh he has Shredder
<GOOD> That's bad
<GOOD> I thought it was 2
<GOOD> God I looked at a 12 year old message board for beating Culex and it was everyone complaining he was too easy
<GOOD> And that people cheesed him too easily
<GOOD> Will other RPGs be too hard for me then?
<GOOD> Just wondering if this was meant to be like super piss baby easy
<GOOD> Radred is dogshit
<GOOD> I don't like how it started a trend of people wanting romhacks to be super hard and awesome and hardcore and miserable
<GOOD> Especially since the game is comically unfair
<GOOD> Like what
<GOOD> Radred isn't made to nuzlocke
<GOOD> It's barely even made to play lmao
<GOOD> Like basically every radred team has to look identical because the fights have almost concrete solutions
<GOOD> Like nuzlockes of Radred/Emerald Kaizo pretty much live or die on Slowbro in the Elite 4
<GOOD> And if you don't have it you lose
<GOOD> I don't like the second one
<GOOD> Random encounters are fine but the fact I didn't have a run button kinda suckes
<GOOD> I think I managed my inventory well enough
<GOOD> In SMRPG you have to buy the run button
<GOOD> I never did since I was saving for the exp ring
<GOOD> Oh that's an image of a horribly disfigured dead child the second I open twitter
<GOOD> Well that kinda sucks
<GOOD> I think it's called that
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> I didn't run from a battle the entire game
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> I thought it was just some archaic RPG thing to make you unable to run
<GOOD> I feel ill
<GOOD> Ffsssssss
<GOOD> I need to curate my timeline better
<GOOD> Twitter
<GOOD> I mean I attempt to have my TL be just shitposts, Pikmin and marine bio and Nintendo facts
<GOOD> And I'm seeing uncensored NSFL of corpses so
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I hate it because as shit as it is that stuff sticks with me
<GOOD> I'm on like 2-3k
<GOOD> I never get the motivation to grind it
<GOOD> I've played for ages but like
<GOOD> At that VR it just seems to get boring
<GOOD> Once bagging starts I think it probably gets shitty
<GOOD> I wish I was good at MK8F
<GOOD> 8D
<GOOD> I'm like, ok at 200cc
<GOOD> But once the game boils down to optimal lines and shortcuts I lost interest in improving
<GOOD> Super or ultra
<GOOD> Idk, like I said I lost interest when it came to following optimal lines on the track
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> There just feels like a disconnect between a fun game and a competitive one once you get to a certain level
<GOOD> The game would go viral
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> Should I buy DK Bongos or just a wiimote and nunchucks for emulation
<GOOD> I also need a sensor bar apparently
<GOOD> So like 20 in total + a bluetooth dongle
<GOOD> Though I think my PC has bluetooth
<GOOD> They technically aren't needed
<GOOD> You can use 2 candles and it'll work lmao
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Also DK Wii games were actually childhood games of mine lmao
<GOOD> The DS one too
<GOOD> Growing up with country returns was ROUGH lmao
<GOOD> Blizzard: we're transitioning
Society: ok
Winston: hi guys
<GOOD> I'm so excited for this tbh
<GOOD> Douglas Douglas is truly a master
<GOOD> I've set a reminder on my phone for it lmao
<GOOD> Parkzer recently has seen more chaotic
<GOOD> Douglas is taking over, Parkzer is no longer the straight man
<GOOD> This is gonna be a long wait between MK8 and 9
<GOOD> This rent thing is starting to stress me out
<GOOD> I need to find people to share rent with
<GOOD> And I only have 1 friend
<GOOD> Ugh its just annoying
<GOOD> My flatmates organised a place without me (which I don't exactly mind since 2 of them are bigots) and now I don't know what to do
<GOOD> I haven't found a place yet
<GOOD> This is for next year
<GOOD> She's looking with her flatmates dn
<GOOD> Rn
<GOOD> Anyway they nerfed bagging
<GOOD> Raaaa
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It's dead pretty much
<GOOD> If you run over the same item box too many times or get the item going backwards/stationary you get less strong items
<GOOD> >stationary
<GOOD> And wdym don't pick up items
<GOOD> I know how checkpoints work, but it's based on your movement
<GOOD> If you're going backwards or stopping, you never get good items
<GOOD> Like ever
<GOOD> Also all the mii suits have cool animations
<GOOD> Even though I'll never use them
<GOOD> I still don't understand why the cow suit does that
<GOOD> Mario Gyatt 8
<GOOD> No one wants to play this stupid Booster Course
Look, if you don't like it, you can leave
*tricks* YOOOO-HO, GYATT
NO! WE ARE NOT DOING THIS AGAIN!
That's a Mario Gyatt 8 right there!
GET OUT! YOU ARE BEING INAPPROPRIATE!
But you don't understand! I've GYATT to finish this track!
**SHUT UP**
<GOOD> Nuh uh
<GOOD> You're the crazy one I'm normal, see? See?
<GOOD> I mean I already loved the game
<GOOD> I've played it for ages
<GOOD> Them making a Mii throw it back for no reason is hilarious tho
<GOOD> Like you trick and they just
<GOOD> Vill, you've GYATT to stop taking this medication
<GOOD> Also I drew funky
<GOOD> I'm using the next best option
<GOOD> Guess I need to learn bikes and heavies
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I will play Diddy and especially Funky
<GOOD> you won't fucking believe what my assignment is
<GOOD> The one I got given
<GOOD> Pauline is sick
<GOOD> She sings during her tricks
<GOOD> I mean it's a neat thing
<GOOD> A fucking podcast
<GOOD> About marine biology
<GOOD> But look at this it's blobfish
<GOOD> What?
Just kidding, look at this!
<GOOD> It would be hilarious tho
<GOOD> But why not ink?
Oh squids should actually use that
<GOOD> I can't play for a few hrs
<GOOD> My article is now almost done
<GOOD> There is no fucking way ppl are complaining about bagging being nerfed
<GOOD> Jesus
<GOOD> Jello
<GOOD> Dandori issue?
<GOOD> I found my new loadout
<GOOD> Holy shit I love this game
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> It's how Funky has always sounded
<GOOD> I LOVE FUNKY RAAAGH
<GOOD> I will not super react boobies
<GOOD> There are unlimited ones, no?
<GOOD> Wait did I get a higher tier of nitro free?
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Does anyone know what to google for that inside out image with the demon in that's like the urge to shit or whatever
<GOOD> YEAHHH
<GOOD> RAINBOW ROAD GAMING
<GOOD> Tearing around that track at 200cc with funky flame rider is making me so happy
<GOOD> The funky kongs yearn for rainbow road
<GOOD> Also SNES Bowser Castle 3 goes hard as fuck
<GOOD> It is oml
<GOOD> It's even more fun at 200
<GOOD> Did you see the video Shork
<GOOD> My funky one
<GOOD> I'm learning funky on the flame rider so I can main him
<GOOD> If you get good lines It's fucking amazing
<GOOD> Yeah unfortunate
<GOOD> The ledge clip really sells it lol
<GOOD> DK Mountain made the jump harder
<GOOD> Also same
<GOOD> I haven't done the jump in 200 yet
<GOOD> Because the turn is too tight
<GOOD> Idk how to orient myself
<GOOD> Not sure if missing the booster entirely is possible or faster tho
<GOOD> I hope I can get the hang of funky bike
<GOOD> Play the fucking game probably lmao
<GOOD> Damn this Mario Kart 8 lobby shit getting serious
<GOOD> Does lying count as being closeted
<GOOD> Funky bike creature is thriving
<GOOD> I started getting hit on purpose by assholes so I quit
<GOOD> I was in 7th and someone threw a red shell backwards to hit me
<GOOD> I got 1 mushroom in 11th earlier I think
<GOOD> That would be shit
<GOOD> So like I'm trying Dragon Quest
<GOOD> And I was told to use a guide for DQ1
<GOOD> And this is the best I have
<GOOD> No I just want to play DQ
<GOOD> Unfortunately NES RPGs are very cryptic and require a guide
<GOOD> Also Toriyama needs to stop jumpscaring me I'm trying 2 different RPG series and they're both illustrated by him
<GOOD> This mf just dripped out Trunks
<GOOD> Idk I just can't get out of my head that this mf would get stomped by Spopovich
<GOOD> Wdym I adore Toriyama's style lmao
<GOOD> I'm of the opinion that his non-Dragonball works are the coolest art he's made
<GOOD> (Minus like Dragon Ball the manga, not Z or Super)
<GOOD> The DQ3 protag is easily the best one to me
<GOOD> It's so cool looking
<GOOD> ~~It isn't that interesting anyway~~
<GOOD> The style is great tho
<GOOD> I like Toriyama's earlier art most
<GOOD> Dragon Ball and Saiyan Saga Z
<GOOD> I mean he obviously had stuff before that
<GOOD> But I'm not knowledgeable enough on that to comment
<GOOD> This art is gas tho
<GOOD> It's Vegeta's Galick Gun from the very end of the first DBZ arc
<GOOD> Stuff like this too
<GOOD> Gohan's development was
Ok
<GOOD> It had ups and downs
<GOOD> But then they kinda threw it away after and that's really annoying
<GOOD> Kid Gohan and like baby Gohan yeah
<GOOD> Imo the older Gohan isn't that good
<GOOD> This one
<GOOD> I like Kid Buu the most out of the DBZ villains
<GOOD> Out of all the villains in DB I like Baby
<GOOD> This one
<GOOD> He is a villain from Dragonball GT
<GOOD> Alongside Super 17 and Omega Shenron
<GOOD> Omega Shenron is p cool at least
<GOOD> And that arc has the coolest mf in dragonball
<GOOD> I caved and bougbt Dragon Quest for 4 on Switch instead of playing the NES one
<GOOD> Because it's significantly improved apparently
<GOOD> I'm in Kol rn
<GOOD> Ngl enjoying it more than I expected
<GOOD> I'm using a walk-through but tbh I wouldn't enjoy it as much without sp
<GOOD> Hello all
<GOOD> I think I'm like halfway through dragon quest already
<GOOD> Lmao I got you
<GOOD> DQ1 is kinda fun ngl
<GOOD> I didn't expect it
<GOOD> 2 artifacts down
<GOOD> 1 to go
<GOOD> I'm glad I used a guide for this tbh, it makes it more fun for me to know where to go
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> How it feels to be the comedian at the grand prix
<GOOD> It takes away a little bit but tbh getting curbstomped by enemies wouldn't be fun
<GOOD> I beat Dragon Quest 1
<GOOD> I think next I wait a few weeks then buy DQ2
<GOOD> I split my purchases of unnecessary things across multiple weeks
<GOOD> The fella
<GOOD> They taste nice
<GOOD> I have officially contaminated my twitter feed with Pik brainrot
<GOOD> Wait have you not seen the original video
<GOOD> One sec it's fucking amazing
<GOOD> Found it
<GOOD> Oh mah god baby
<GOOD> It was probably posted unironically but ironically it's one of the funniest videos I have saved
<GOOD> Oh my god please no
<GOOD> Apparently Peachette is meta in MK8D
<GOOD> Oh mah gawd baby
<GOOD> my mom is worried about me not spending enough money :((
<GOOD> No bc
<GOOD> I panicked today and paid extra for someone at the launderette to do it
<GOOD> Instead of doing it myself
<GOOD> And now I feel shit because I'm spending too much and she had to calm me down
<GOOD> I think so
<GOOD> Iirc I have like, 1000 for the next 6 weeks since I get paid every semester
<GOOD> So ig I'll just keep sitting on it
<GOOD> It's a maintenance loan, I barely spend it
<GOOD> I think I can technically spend like 100+ a week but that's fucking stupid
<GOOD> I usually average like 25
<GOOD> Well yeah because I have to pay it back
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> But I do not have job experience so womp womp
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I do tho
<GOOD> It was 25 for the dude to wash, dry and fold (I shouldn't have agreed to fold but I was frantic enough already I didn't need to try and convey that)
<GOOD> So I just went yeah
<GOOD> I felt bad buying 3 hot chocolate so I have now bought 1 hot chocolate lmao
<GOOD> Somehow I don't think this money is going anywhere
<GOOD> This isn't a bursary unfortunately
<GOOD> Just loan money
<GOOD> Though I think I do qualify for one they said it was automatic if I qualified and I didn't get any so
<GOOD> I'll just save it for later
<GOOD> Tbf, I'm getting used to the 1 hot chocolate
<GOOD> If I'm doing the math right it's  like 12p per cup of chocolate
<GOOD> So very useful
<GOOD> At least I only have to do laundry like, once every 2 months since I fill up my basket
<GOOD> Eh, I mostly wear pajamas and casual clothes anyway
<GOOD> Oh my god I've spent 50 already this month
<GOOD> And I think that's excluding the bank withdrawal I made to pay for the laundry
<GOOD> I have a large laundry basket
<GOOD> I mean when I put them in the basket they aren't really dirty
<GOOD> They don't smell like anything and I don't really get anything on them so
<GOOD> I think I've stained 1 shirt since I've gotten here
<GOOD> So I don't see the issue
<GOOD> I know but as I said it doesn't smell or anything when I put them in the basket, and even today when I was unloading them they didn't smell like anything
<GOOD> Are you suggesting my clothes would grow mold
<GOOD> I mean I barely sweat bc I don't exert myself
<GOOD> And it's freezing here constantly
<GOOD> Does washing not clean it or like
<GOOD> Am I missing something
<GOOD> Thanks
<GOOD> Here you can borrow this, we already have GBTQ+
<GOOD> (Kidding lesbians are awesome too raaaagh)
<GOOD> I guess
<GOOD> I only have TQ
<GOOD> Wha
<GOOD> I haven't even found a name for the specific sexuality I have tbh lmao
<GOOD> And I'm still a bit questioning on some things
<GOOD> The closest I've found is attraction to anyone feminine but like, I don't like feminine guys
<GOOD> Yeah but finding a label is hard
<GOOD> As is finding what I actually like
<GOOD> And how I present that to other ppl in a word
<GOOD> I guess yeah
<GOOD> Yeah I'm just sitting and questioning
<GOOD> I think as far as my gender goes I'm as comfortable as I could be for now
<GOOD> Finsexual is all fem presenting people including guys
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Might be gyne idk x_x
<GOOD> It makes me feel shallow to be attracted just on things like that but it's probably true
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Unfortunately
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> I'm just leaving all the men for the rest of you
<GOOD> I love women
<GOOD> Also I've spent 75 in 10 days I'm shooting to reach the middle of the month with only 100 spent
<GOOD> Wait nvm I have food for the next few days I'm good
<GOOD> Just gotta buy like, 4 worth of chicken
<GOOD> Then I'm good
<GOOD> I feel bad for spending a lot but whatever
<GOOD> The money is spent
<GOOD> I have not recieved a message from the launderette and it's about 10 minutes until it was meant to be ready
<GOOD> Bit worried
<GOOD> Aaaa it's almost the time they said
<GOOD> I'm worried
<GOOD> Ugh idk what to do
<GOOD> Do I go there and ask?
<GOOD> It's not urgent so like do I just wait a bit
<GOOD> But what if I wrote my phone number wrong or smth uhhhh
<GOOD> Well shit
<GOOD> I think I made a mistake
<GOOD> The 2s in my number look like 7s ffssss
<GOOD> Now I have to go ask
<GOOD> How do I fuck everything up
<GOOD> Fuck it I'm gonna ask
<GOOD> CEO of making absolutely everything harder for myself
<GOOD> Man I'm a fucking idiot
<GOOD> I did write the number weird and had to go check but I'm SO FUCKING AWKWARD
<GOOD> FFSSS
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It's fine, I got it done
<GOOD> I wanna eat the warheads ones
<GOOD> The cubes alone are nice but the galactic ones look yummier
<GOOD> Mmmm
<GOOD> Mfw no gf
<GOOD> So many ppl have said that unironically lmao
<GOOD> I will not supply context
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I do have a very small handful of people I hate
<GOOD> And like, 2 of them are E-celebs
<GOOD> Although now I think about it this particular one has had tons of reasons up until now
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't like Kobeni
<GOOD> Omg someone made a MH edit of the pokemon vid
<GOOD> I should play GU again
<GOOD> I stopped playing because I didn't know what quests I needed to do to unlock the rest of the Fated Four
<GOOD> January is like, I don't have anything going on
<GOOD> September to December is my peak since I get to be overly festive in a very long streak
<GOOD> Without fun stuff the monotony gets to me
<GOOD> Existing isn't enough I need things to be excited for
<GOOD> Or just enjoy the vibe tbh
<GOOD> My friends are being super festive rn and even if they go out at night we have stuff like an Elf on the Shelf we move around
<GOOD> And the fairy lights are pretty
<GOOD> We can walk around and enjoy some soon
<GOOD> Only 1 person in the flat doesn't care for festivity but I literally couldn't care less what they think
<GOOD> Or just do something fun for yourself
<GOOD> Christmas got a lot of shit to do alone
<GOOD> Literally just admiring the season, festive foods, random public events, treating yourself more, etc
<GOOD> Black Friday is coming up
<GOOD> It's literally just an opportunity to get shit you might want for cheap
<GOOD> We don't have Black Friday like that here
<GOOD> It's mostly just really good online sales
<GOOD> People in my hometown were shooting fireworks at each other a few weeks ago
<GOOD> Why does it always have to be a pissing contest
<GOOD> Yes, I live in the UK
<GOOD> Pissing contest
<GOOD> It's a saying for when people are trying to one up each other constantly
<GOOD> Hahahahahahahahaha
<GOOD> As far as I know a literal pissing contest would be based on distance, but as I said it's a saying and not an actual thing
<GOOD> It's a more SFW term for a different saying
<GOOD> I don't understand what's so confusing
<GOOD> Like the saying is just people trying to one up each other for no reason other than to 'win' something completely pointless
<GOOD> My teachers said that often
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Wdym you see it now
<GOOD> I literally explained what it meant and then you replied with the thing I was explaining
<GOOD> Vill I'm ngl you just aren't making sense
<GOOD> There's only like 3 contexts piss can be used in
Anger
Drinking alcohol
Peeing
<GOOD> In this saying pissing absolutely means going to the bathroom
<GOOD> It's just a saying as I said
<GOOD> Uhh imagine 2 people at the gym trying to lift heavier and heavier weights than one another until one person fucking dies or injures themself
<GOOD> That's an example of a pissing contest
<GOOD> It's pointless
<GOOD> Like my dude
<GOOD> Yes???
<GOOD> Why would pissing contest be anything except slang
<GOOD> I thought this dude was american
<GOOD> This isn't like some insanely obscure thing
<GOOD> Just because you didn't know what it was and kept asking what I meant it doesn't make it obscure
<GOOD> You thought I meant pissing as in being angry for like a solid 10 minutes
<GOOD> If it's in the fucking dictionary I'd say it's probably well known enough
<GOOD> Then Where's the confusion
<GOOD> I even pulled up the ACTUAL definition
<GOOD> Ok so, you think I mean pissing as angry
<GOOD> Pissing in this saying literally means pissing because a pissing contest is such a ridiculous idea that it encapsulates what the saying means perfectly
<GOOD> Like a contest between 2 random people on who can spit further, or hum louder
<GOOD> But that's what all of it is in the end
<GOOD> A completely unspoken, informal and ridiculous contest where the only point of winning is to prove you're better at something
<GOOD> It specifically refers to pointless posturing and subjects
<GOOD> Like this started with the interaction:
We don't have violent black fridays
Because you're lame
Well we have firework violence
The US has that every day
<GOOD> That's pointless posturing
<GOOD> There's no point in winning because all it proves is which country is more needlessly violent
<GOOD> Ergo, pissing contest
<GOOD> Yes but we were one-upping each other for literally 0 reason
<GOOD> But it's what happened
<GOOD> Taking the mick is something I've heard fairly often
<GOOD> Mick is short for Mickey
<GOOD> OH SHIT
<GOOD> My alarm is ready for later
<GOOD> I didn't even realise
<GOOD> I think you need hair gone for surgery?
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Or is it not that sort of laser thing
<GOOD> Yeah I thought so
<GOOD> Lmao seeing the cybertruck attempt to drive is so funny
<GOOD> It can't go up hills
<GOOD> It's too heavy
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Just put a hook in the ground and watch as the cybertruck changes the Earth's orbit
<GOOD> Unfortunately
<GOOD> I just want 1
<GOOD> It's entirely rigid
<GOOD> That's why they boasted it was bulletproof or whatever
<GOOD> It literally has no crumple zone
<GOOD> Why am I paying for 2 then smh
<GOOD> I keep watching this video
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Crisp rat
<GOOD> I love Garfield unironically
<GOOD> So an animated movie makes me happy
<GOOD> Idk why the comics themselves are just dumb fun
<GOOD> Marcel
<GOOD> Does the fact it doesn't fit with the song like half the time make it better or worse
<GOOD> Ok but like
<GOOD> Are we too far gone now
<GOOD> Also Vill have you seen Steamed Gyatts yet or are you still sane
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I will spare your sanity
<GOOD> It's on youtube
<GOOD> You've been warned
<GOOD> I've been swallowed up into a gen alpha community I fear
<GOOD> Not during Pizza Time?
<GOOD> LMAO
<GOOD> I can't believe that the skibeo got Pibby glitched
<GOOD> Don't send me to the Pizza Tower they'll rizz me
<GOOD> I dunno, you seem kinda uncanny to me
<GOOD> (I don't care about being called sir as a joke it just makes me antsy)
<GOOD> The only formal term I know for enby people is Mx
<GOOD> But like that doesn't fit so
<GOOD> In the end... we're all rizzed
<GOOD> Emperor
<GOOD> Wait
<GOOD> That's masc I'm dumb
<GOOD> SHUFFLEMANIA IS HERE
<GOOD> I haven't been hyped for smth like this in gorever
<GOOD> Forever
<GOOD> I voted for Genshin last year for the rewards for my friends ngl
<GOOD> It's usually rigged anyway
<GOOD> I'm so stressed about this assignment womp womp
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> I'm rlly nervous about this
<GOOD> I have to like, create an entirely new thing to investigate
<GOOD> And that's super fucking hard when everything has been done
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I'm so done
<GOOD> Can't keep up liking myself
<GOOD> I do too many shit things
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I'm frustrating to myself
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I've become obsessed with these edits
<GOOD> I haven't heard of a channel w Dedenne as a mascot
<GOOD> I'm gaining some weight which makes me sad
<GOOD> I've been eating too may frozen chips and chicken
<GOOD> At least I have broccoli ig
<GOOD> I bought an innocent smoothie today
<GOOD> but you still need Licensed Trainer to have image perms
<GOOD> Omidi
<GOOD> I didn't know Omori was an RPG
<GOOD> I just smelled the midness
<GOOD> Me beating my friend at Omori
<GOOD> (We are playing the vs mode)
<GOOD> There's no way it doesn't
<GOOD> If it doesn't I will completely forsake TGA
<GOOD> I've seen a lot of Engage support
<GOOD> But if Pikmin doesn't crush Engage....
<GOOD> Also someone sent me this pfp
<GOOD> I really wanna use it
<GOOD> Pikmin is just unrelenting chaos
<GOOD> The Pikmin fandom fucking needs this they're ravenous
<GOOD> You know who isn't
<GOOD> The Pik fans will bring 100 purples to TGA and threaten to crush the stage
<GOOD> I don't think you've played Pikmin either lmao
<GOOD> Pikmin must win or the fandom implodes
<GOOD> All that anger from waiting 10 years for Pik 4 will be directed at the thing that wins
<GOOD> Pikmin sweep
<GOOD> The socioeconomic effects of a Pikmin sweep are unrivaled
<GOOD> Yeah but the 10 years drove the fandom insane
<GOOD> You can't come back from that once we made up Fiddlebert it was already ovsr
<GOOD> I don't care about TGA but I know what must happen
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> So apparently the wider gaming audience didn't understand what Mario was until it got a GotY nomination lmao
<GOOD> I'm just hoping for SMW to win because it's funny
<GOOD> I wonder what outrage would have happened if Pikmin was a nominee
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> New pfp????
<GOOD> I have an assignment to complete by Friday and I can't even start
<GOOD> It's an important one too
<GOOD> I have to think of a whole new hypothesis man
<GOOD> I thought Naruto and Sasuke just ended up w mutual respect and friendship
<GOOD> I know they kiss at the start as a joke
<GOOD> But that's like saying Mario and Booster are made for each other
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I have to visit a house listing today
<GOOD> Kinda annoying but nothing too bad
<GOOD> It's just being taken around 3 houses
<GOOD> Also rosie lurker
<GOOD> I mean what other option is there, you don't typically get too deep with people you don't know
<GOOD> That's what the date is gor
<GOOD> Love will never come to me organically
<GOOD> That's cool but I'm not interesting enough for that womp womp
<GOOD> Pikmin and probably nothing else
<GOOD> Maybe not the place
<GOOD> This isn't matchat
<GOOD> Yeah I'm aware, there's just too many factors that go into a relationship rn
<GOOD> Like I'm barely holding 1 friend
<GOOD> I have 1 and it's sustained by the fact she has a bunch of stuff she loves talking about
<GOOD> Which means I can just discuss that because she's good at holding a conversation
<GOOD> Not if I'm not interesting
<GOOD> My interests are too limited or generic
<GOOD> The subject I study at university that I don't know enough about to interest people that study it, gaming, anime, basically whatever you avoid saying as a hobby on a job application
<GOOD> I have read a lot of classic literature and then more recently Terry Pratchett novels
<GOOD> Which is like so specific
<GOOD> I have never met or talked to a Discworld fan in my entire life for a reason
<GOOD> Oh believe me I've tried lmao
<GOOD> Hey what kind of games do you play?
Oh I play Pikmin!
Oh that's cool, I've never played or heard much about Pikmin
<GOOD> And they aren't interested in knowing about random Nintendo IPs
<GOOD> It's not like a that's cool that means they care, it's a isn't that nice polite one
<GOOD> At least during the gaming society meetups I talk to ppl about Mario Kart
<GOOD> Idk, I just feed off random trivia about media
<GOOD> And conveying that to a person is very frustrating
<GOOD> At least me and my 1 irl friend share a mutual liking of Splatoon
<GOOD> I don't know trivia, I like being told about it
<GOOD> Like how in Fist of the North Star's anime, they ripped up and wobbled animation cels as an animation technique to simulate movement
<GOOD> Which is cool to me but isn't gonna ever come up
<GOOD> Same goes for game design trivia, facts about things that happened during the filming of movies, etc
<GOOD> Unfortunately I don't have like, a springboard to interest people with
<GOOD> Most of the things I know about require previously already knowing or having an interest in things to talk about them
<GOOD> If I talked to anyone about Berserk (not obscure) in a context other than them having read it I would probably lose that friend
<GOOD> Cowboy Bebop is like, yeah I could talk about that but it becomes interesting once they've watched it
<GOOD> Same as most other things
<GOOD> I am not an interesting person unless you have very niche and random interests like competitive doubles pokemon
<GOOD> Anyway ig I need to make myself more interesting soon
<GOOD> Yeah, online
<GOOD> Where it's easy to just sort groups of people by things they already like
<GOOD> I need at least some mutual understanding to talk to a person irl and usually that's just me making short small talk
<GOOD> Well yeah but I'm already ok at online
<GOOD> Irl is just a completely different thing
<GOOD> I have 1 irl friend, let alone a partner or anything
<GOOD> I'll just deal w it for a few more decades
<GOOD> I've been trying to be more open but like, as I said no one really knows what I like lmao, either that or I don't know what they like well enough
<GOOD> Like my interest is anime? Completely generic, but when it comes to mainstream anime my only opinion and analysis of it can be oh that was a good anime
<GOOD> My 1 irl friend likes Chainsaw Man and Demon Slayer, 2 anime I have seen most of and still can't discuss at length because I didn't absorb enough of it to talk about it
<GOOD> That's just an example ofc but I'm unable to create a bridge for most interests
<GOOD> Because they care a lot more than I do and therefore most of what I can discuss with them just becomes agreeing with what they're saying
<GOOD> So it's a me problem all around in the end
<GOOD> I burned myself out oversharing again ffs
<GOOD> This is why I shouldn't
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> At least here I do
<GOOD> And in online spaces in general
<GOOD> I've done it a bit less recently because crippling trust issues but yk, I never did it irl so
<GOOD> It's pretty bad when it makes me distressed
<GOOD> This went from I have a friend to I have 1 friend irl to I don't have a partner to I am so damn boring
<GOOD> Always snowballs
<GOOD> If you mean the horror one it's been around a while
<GOOD> What's the name
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> If it's the one that was passed around on Twitter constantly for weeks then it wasn't actually scary or anything
<GOOD> I haven't seen like, any new game recently lmao
<GOOD> I watched RT play that VN princess game which was cool to watch tho
<GOOD> Neat artstyle
<GOOD> And funny
<GOOD> Oh right there was like, Mario and Sonic and Spiderman or smth
<GOOD> The whole universe was in a hot dense state...
<GOOD> I went looking for housing
<GOOD> Super nice place
<GOOD> Good lounge, nice rooms
<GOOD> Only issue is kitchen storage
<GOOD> Yeah because me and flatmates are looking together
<GOOD> This one seems lovely at least
<GOOD> We've dropped 1 flatmate bc they're a huge pack rat
<GOOD> Got a ton of trash in there
<GOOD> This one does that but w/o the fire alarm
<GOOD> And leaves food to rot in the fridge
<GOOD> Also their room is just completely full of amazon boxes, like actually so much so you can't walk there
<GOOD> And cans, random crap etc
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I may draw my pfp
<GOOD> A new one idk
<GOOD> Dwebble
<GOOD> Idk how to draw them tho
<GOOD> Trying to draw any anatomy is hard
<GOOD> Also my pencil is being shit rn
<GOOD> This teacher is pissing me off so so so much man
<GOOD> This teacher makes me tired
<GOOD> All the time but especially today because she's also pissing me off even more
<GOOD> I bet it's Seph
<GOOD> Hopefully they're a cool boss
<GOOD> I think @ProsafiaGaming will enjoy dissecting this frame by frame
<GOOD> Do the original characters for the game count as Square property still then?
<GOOD> Ah alr
<GOOD> So they own that fatass bird
<GOOD> Does square own the modified Mario original designs
<GOOD> Like heavy troopas
<GOOD> And Boshi
<GOOD> I'd say there is a different reason for that lmao
<GOOD> But if they do own stuff like that it's super interesting
<GOOD> Oh yeah
<GOOD> I like Boshi
<GOOD> Booster eating cake HD animation
<GOOD> Momkey
<GOOD> I'm gonna watch all bosses rn
<GOOD> I think @ProsafiaGaming will enjoy dissecting this frame by frame
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I have 2 hunts set up for the gaming marathon now
<GOOD> In case I get burnout playing games that require me to be active
<GOOD> Oh also, what are the best NES and GB games on the NSO library
<GOOD> I wanna try a few
<GOOD> (Not the super popular ones I've probably already played them)
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> Big Man's outfit is cool w the amiibo
<GOOD> I still wanna create a pikmin shrine
<GOOD> Unfortunately there is a ludicrously expensive pikmin amiibo so x_x
<GOOD> The large yosh
<GOOD> Also someone just sent me this
<GOOD> Pomni
<GOOD> Look how long it takes to select Wario
<GOOD> Wait till you find out how many of the characters in that image are actually in that game
<GOOD> I should make a chibi robo shrine...
<GOOD> I will sit on a throne made of Chibi Robo Zip Lasj
<GOOD> No, he isn't
<GOOD> I still wanna find a franchise or game that clicks for me
<GOOD> Like Pikmin was really good but if there's ever a game that makes me feel wonder again it'll probably be my favourite game of all time
<GOOD> And no I prefer Ace Attorney
<GOOD> Rizz?
<GOOD> Say what you want, I'm proud of that drawing
<GOOD> This video has driven me insane
<GOOD> *skibidimore
<GOOD> What about Pibby
<GOOD> Ego death
<GOOD> Nathaniel B got scooped up into the Ohio Rizz stuff
<GOOD> I don't know why
<GOOD> Never....
<GOOD> I can't believe Pibby got Pibby glitched....
<GOOD> Also Pibby became gen alpha when people basically used the corruption as an excuse to make all of them sonic.exe
<GOOD> It's 20 minutes long and genuinely good
<GOOD> You don't lose anything by trying
<GOOD> The only hyperactive character is Cane
<GOOD> And like that's just how he is
<GOOD> No Pomni, we are ADVENTURING a bank!
<GOOD> My friend showed me Murder Drones and that led to me watching TADC and now we hyperfixate on it together
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Pomni got Pibby glitched
<GOOD> He's a tumblr sexyman it was inevitable
<GOOD> Jax isn't the teeth guy
<GOOD> He just has a big smile
<GOOD> But Cane is the teeth guy
<GOOD> I love him
<GOOD> I honestly don't think so
<GOOD> Kinger feels like a character they'll keep around for a will they or won't they bait
<GOOD> Idk Jax is fine
<GOOD> It got scooped up by content farms
<GOOD> And I don't hang around playgrounds so
<GOOD> Pizza tower rizz
<GOOD> Then you wouldn't be listening to kids fucking talk about skibidi toilet
<GOOD> Have you ever seen Spiderman and Elsa
<GOOD> That's a content farm
<GOOD> Not necessarily elsagate but elsagate is content farm ye
<GOOD> Marine Biology
<GOOD> And I don't have it yet
<GOOD> Because you're not talking to children
<GOOD> Not really
<GOOD> This is more like those FNAF fan animations
<GOOD> Where like young teen band kids and young children watch it
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Band kid humour is like haha it's really loud communist music!!!!!
<GOOD> Or T posing or saying reeeeee
<GOOD> Educational content has fallen
<GOOD> This is actually a YT Kids video btw
<GOOD> Chuds
<GOOD> Hope this helps
<GOOD> Oh we've already moved on from that D
<GOOD> Coffin of Andy and Laylay(?) Is already in the dust
<GOOD> We don't talk about it anymore because it stopped being funny
<GOOD> And it never was
<GOOD> But then people realised it wasn't
<GOOD> It's been weeks
<GOOD> You've missed the trend
<GOOD> Keep trying tho you'll get there
<GOOD> Skibidi ohio rizz
<GOOD> It was also because the creator mocked people criticising that content in a way that made it seem he agreed w it
<GOOD> I never spent any frog coins lmaooo
<GOOD> I think the most recent thing is the Dream parody account 5:1 ratio'ing the real Dream account, but I'm not talking about that here
<GOOD> Retro, you say...
<GOOD> I mean he's ok for some of the game
<GOOD> OH WAIT
<GOOD> I REMEMBER THE RECENT TREND KINDA
<GOOD> Lightning Mcqueen powerscaling
<GOOD> Idk I got the lazy shell
<GOOD> But I didn't know how Jump worked so I basically never used it the whole game
<GOOD> Which really sucks
<GOOD> Jump gets stronger the more you use it
<GOOD> But since I never used it it didn't get stronger, and since it wasn't stronger I didn't use it
<GOOD> I just thought it was shit lmao
<GOOD> No but like, there's a value for how many times in the entire game you've used Jump
<GOOD> Super Jump is different
<GOOD> I mean with Jump you can
<GOOD> And every basic attack and most spells
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah that threw me off too
<GOOD> Raaaa
<GOOD> I mean it's pretty good yeah
<GOOD> 50% usage on the most used mon isn't bad at all
<GOOD> I still can't believe ASBR added a part 8 character
<GOOD> Very happy rn
<GOOD> Gappy was in at release
<GOOD> He was the only p8 character in until now
<GOOD> Part 8 spoilers
<GOOD> I'm very happy about this
<GOOD> My favorite stand in the series
<GOOD> ||the stand is the most present part of his character||
<GOOD> That's why it's in the foreground
<GOOD> ||the guy himself is usually very far away when WoU is around||
<GOOD> ||He sends it off like an automatic drone that he can partially control||
<GOOD> It's semi-automated
<GOOD> And ||it can be pretty much sentient when automatic? It's one of the most autonomous stands in the series||
<GOOD> Anyway this stand is fucking awesome I love it
<GOOD> I have no idea how it'll work in a fighting game tho
<GOOD> I used to main Pucci in ASBR
<GOOD> It was so toxic
<GOOD> I don't play him often
<GOOD> He's fairly technical or spammy with no in-between
<GOOD> I just loved Pucci because he's an absolute shithead camper
<GOOD> Every time you give him like half a second of space Pucci will pull out his stupid ass baby
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> Johnny and Gyro in Eyes of Heaven can be broken
<GOOD> Esp Gyro
<GOOD> I wish
<GOOD> WoU is gonna be so broken lmao
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Everyone has seen Highway Go-Go
<GOOD> And Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price came from the fighting game I'm talking about
<GOOD> Robert E.O Speedwagon was kept tho
<GOOD> Blueford was an unfortunate victim tho
<GOOD> Yeah I'm aware
<GOOD> But REO Speedwagon is more obvious
<GOOD> Why did you say canon instead of just real
<GOOD> I mean Jack the Ripper is real
<GOOD> He existed
<GOOD> Being a serial killer doesn't make you Jack the Ripper
<GOOD> Being a serial killer
<GOOD> And I'm fairly sure that Jack the Ripper wasn't meticulous
<GOOD> He was just lucky
<GOOD> And the police were shit
<GOOD> This is such a funny image
<GOOD> Why were they shitting on a fictional character this bad
<GOOD> 280 THOUSAND COMMENTS!?
<GOOD> I find the image so funny lmao
<GOOD> Bro is so upset
<GOOD> Seems like it lmao
<GOOD> I hate being shit at games
<GOOD> I wish I had a game I was good at ffs
<GOOD> Getting beaten constantly is annoying
<GOOD> Got to semis in a smash tournament then got absolutely shit on by the only 2 sweats present
<GOOD> Man
<GOOD> I haven't won a single event all day :((
<GOOD> This is depressing af
<GOOD> Yeah but I'm not winning shit
<GOOD> I got to the semis through luck, I lost Portal by multiple minutes
<GOOD> I literally did tho
<GOOD> I didn't play against a competent player until the semis
<GOOD> And I got absolutely destroyed
<GOOD> It's really annoying
<GOOD> Because I'm not good at games
<GOOD> Yeah but as I said, everyone up until then had barely played the game
<GOOD> And then I came up against someone that random'd to Pit and completely demolished me
<GOOD> And now the only events left are ones I'm gonna be decimated in
<GOOD> Pisses me off so much I can't be good at shit
<GOOD> I already spent 2 hours getting fucked up by the people I lost to
<GOOD> Didn't learn a thing
<GOOD> They were playing different characters, it doesn't apply to me
<GOOD> And they came to those conclusions by literally being better
<GOOD> They had sharper movement and better stage perception and recovery
<GOOD> But they are still better
<GOOD> Yeah but I'm learning nothing by just playing it
<GOOD> Wario has good aerials--> use Wario's aerials
<GOOD> That's not how I learn
<GOOD> They are playing Yoshi, they are basically me with a better Fair and faster movement
<GOOD> And they beat me as Pit by outranging me and carrying me offstage
<GOOD> They literally beat me as Yoshi by just playing the character
<GOOD> Like they played it well and I lost because Yoshi played well is a death sentence
<GOOD> There isn't a matchup diagnosis for Wario vs Yoshi
<GOOD> It's just a matter of who is better at the game
<GOOD> And I was worse
<GOOD> So I got 2 stocked
<GOOD> I was worse at the game so I lost
<GOOD> That's literally how it worked
<GOOD> The solution is get better lmao you suck
<GOOD> I know Yoshi
<GOOD> He has very very strong and long reaching aerials
<GOOD> He is hard to punish in the air and he was better so I was typically above him on stage
<GOOD> Which means I lost
<GOOD> The solution is always just be better so you can X
<GOOD> Wario only has 1 safe method of getting down and it's heavily exploitable
<GOOD> And I lost to a pit anyway so it's a skill diff
<GOOD> I got fucked up by them on about 6 different characters, it didn't matter
<GOOD> Well the solution to being juggled is be better at staying on the ground
<GOOD> And the solution to that is to improve your aerial game, and the solution to that is to be better
<GOOD> I am not good at this game so I lost the aerial game and I lost
<GOOD> Most of Yoshi's fast attacks launch
<GOOD> Any shorthop aerial completely fucks you
<GOOD> And most tilts
<GOOD> And most disruption they have
<GOOD> And any throw
<GOOD> I don't know that, do I
<GOOD> Yoshi has many many many options for juggling
<GOOD> And you win that guessing game by being better
<GOOD> It all comes back to just being better and I'm not
<GOOD> Wario's best tools involve being directly below or above people and Yoshi beats him in that
<GOOD> I mean my go to when Yoshi engages is bike but shorthop fair punishes that
<GOOD> As does basically everything except shield
<GOOD> It gets outranged
<GOOD> And Yoshi is maneuverable enough to punish it anyway
<GOOD> Once you commit you're gonna get shielded
<GOOD> Yeah because if Yoshi is grounded it's punished by shield, if he's not he's in the air and using better aerials than me
<GOOD> Because he knows my best anti air tool is the corkscrew
<GOOD> When I DI to try and fall away from them they're fast enough to pin me down again
<GOOD> Bait an up air and punish with...
<GOOD> Nothing?
<GOOD> It comes out obscenely fast and has far better range
<GOOD> And Yoshi's anti air options are fantastic anyway because of course they are
<GOOD> I'm just so tired of being fucked up and being ass man
<GOOD> Every game
<GOOD> I know what to do, I can't do it
<GOOD> That is every game
<GOOD> Oh of course just because I can't do something it means I don't know how
<GOOD> Yeah but what you're saying is do what they do
<GOOD> I understand how Wario works, how his pressure works and his insane potential to string people together across the stage
<GOOD> I literally just can't do that
<GOOD> It's not as easy as do that
<GOOD> It also isn't that
<GOOD> I didn't say it was
<GOOD> I said it's not as easy as just seeing then doing
<GOOD> Spending hours stringing together shorthop aerials at specific % ranges in specific situations from a visual example is like
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> Most games don't
<GOOD> Because I am shit at them
<GOOD> Because I am not just bad at games
<GOOD> Is that really possible
<GOOD> Knitting is absolutely something I can judge myself on
<GOOD> I tried crocheting for a while and got pissed at myself since I could barely even make a few loops after a while of trying
<GOOD> That goes for most art forms
<GOOD> Every level of drawing is valid, doesn't mean I don't hate my drawings
<GOOD> I have been doing art for the better part of 10 years, can't draw still
<GOOD> None, I don't have a teacher or something to teach myself with
<GOOD> Because then it becomes something I can judge myself on even worse
<GOOD> Yeah and improving makes me frustrated since I do not
<GOOD> I don't get better
<GOOD> Usually a few weeks
<GOOD> Then there is 0 real improvement and I quit, since it's mentally taxing
<GOOD> It's enough to be able to see some improvement
<GOOD> Also I can't analyse this game
<GOOD> The only time I can analyse it is when Wario is in neutral because then he just spams shorthop nairs
<GOOD> And in advantage state he spams bairs
<GOOD> Surely after a few weeks I'd learn at least something
<GOOD> Literally anything
<GOOD> I have not succeeded at improving in something I haven't copied exactly in years
<GOOD> Yeah because those goals become expectations
<GOOD> And those expectations aren't met
<GOOD> And then they become frustration
<GOOD> Because that's what a goal is
<GOOD> It's never small enough
<GOOD> Trust me
<GOOD> It's been months since I tried shorthop aerials on Wario
<GOOD> And I still can't do them
<GOOD> I can't even do a nair consistently
<GOOD> Yes, that's where I tried learning them lmao
<GOOD> And then in actual execution it was completely wrong
<GOOD> Same as my art, I can visualise it and then it doesn't work
<GOOD> At best it's semi consistent
<GOOD> I did that for a few weeks and then again, I was making 0 progress on it
<GOOD> I wasn't any closer and I wasn't any better than when I started
<GOOD> Hell, I was actually better at art a few years ago when I had less practice
<GOOD> Not really, I'm just some fucking prodigy that somehow can't learn to do a single thing
<GOOD> I would kill to be some sort of savant at 1 random niche thing because as it stands I'm literally not good at anything
<GOOD> I don't have a pace
<GOOD> 10 years and I'm worse than 4 years ago
<GOOD> I actually am tho, I just don't have my drawings from 4 years ago
<GOOD> I could actually draw anatomy well before, I've just gotten worse despite still drawing often
<GOOD> It always starts like that lmao
<GOOD> It's the only reason I still draw
<GOOD> I'm like oh this will be fun and then it turns out really shit and I hate it
<GOOD> SCOTT PILGRIM IS DATING A 17 YEAR OLD!?
<GOOD> They would never cover this in the movie
<GOOD> It would never be the first fucking thing they say lmao
<GOOD> Depends
<GOOD> That's literally what I do
<GOOD> I draw a thing, say everything that's wrong about it, and get frustrated that I did it wrong
<GOOD> In the movie iirc the first line is that he's dating a high schooler
<GOOD> Then what do I do about the rest
<GOOD> But that's not what's being said
<GOOD> But does that mean I keep drawing it wrong
<GOOD> Yeah but I already know what's wrong the first time
<GOOD> One, because I don't want to draw the same mistake over and over
<GOOD> But I already know what I have to improve
<GOOD> Doing them wrong over and over is just frustrating
<GOOD> Do you really think I can do that
<GOOD> Ignoring my other mistakes is impossible
<GOOD> Especially when I have to keep doing them
<GOOD> If a basketball player is bad at all 3 of those things why would they continue doing it badly on purpose
<GOOD> It also doesn't make sense for them to not improve
<GOOD> Like I am not improving at anything FL
<GOOD> I haven't for months
<GOOD> I basically put my life on hold for about a month or two to improve myself mentally and it's now been 3 months and I'm not any better than when I started
<GOOD> There's a point where I gotta give up on these things
<GOOD> Guess who has already tried drawing hands many many times over multiple years
<GOOD> And my best hands are still shit
<GOOD> Why would I do that
<GOOD> Hands are part of something else though
<GOOD> It's like drawing a photorealistic eye and putting it on nothing
<GOOD> Which one
<GOOD> I don't but I understand the concept
<GOOD> Penalties are things that can be taken by most of the team tho
<GOOD> And footballers train everything at once
<GOOD> They do drills
<GOOD> They don't just do penalty drills, they'll do free kicks, movement etc
<GOOD> No, they're equivalent to trying to fix multiple issues at once
<GOOD> Yeah, they are trying to fix multiple specific things
<GOOD> They don't just do 1 drill until they're good at it
<GOOD> They do drills on everything
<GOOD> All in sequence
<GOOD> And in sequence
<GOOD> It kinda does tho
<GOOD> Because it's fixing every problem at once
<GOOD> It's like being told to draw hands then feet then legs etc rather than being told to draw an entire person
<GOOD> You aren't hearing what I'm saying
<GOOD> They don't do 1 thing
<GOOD> They do multiple things
<GOOD> Because you are saying 2 different things
<GOOD> Do 1 drill constantly vs do multiple drills at the same time
<GOOD> And yet what I have to do is teach myself on top of having the command just do a layup
<GOOD> Like if I knew how to fix my issues I wouldn't have them
<GOOD> I can't just be like yeah if I do this over and over I'll be good at it because it's not true
<GOOD> Because when I'm told to draw 1 thing that becomes the big picture
<GOOD> Not without direction
<GOOD> If you were told to do a layup
<GOOD> You wouldn't get better by just doing it over and over again
<GOOD> With 0 direction?
<GOOD> You were told to do a layup for weeks on end without any advice
<GOOD> And you did that and were just better after that
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> That's not exactly what happened
<GOOD> You were told how to improve exactly
<GOOD> You had a coach to tell you exactly what to do
<GOOD> In the end that's just copying, which is what I did when I was good
<GOOD> I was basically just shown a picture and I drew it exactly
<GOOD> I didn't learn anything from it
<GOOD> I drew good anatomy because I drew that anatomy directly onto my page
<GOOD> Nothing
<GOOD> I have a pencil and a drawing pad and a tablet but I'm fucking awful at digital art
<GOOD> What I did when I was learning was literally copying a drawing
<GOOD> It's why I can't draw stuff like that now
<GOOD> Because I didn't learn it I just took a drawing and drew that
<GOOD> Expensive and usually doesn't let me convey what I want well when it comes to things like perspective
<GOOD> Yeah but perspective on a person's poses yes
<GOOD> Like if I want a specific angle how do I use that
<GOOD> The thing is I can visualise it in my head it just looks like this when I draw it
<GOOD> Like I physically cannot draw what I see
<GOOD> Unless I am copying it directly and that doesn't work for thoughts
<GOOD> Yeah but it won't look right because I can't draw depth
<GOOD> I might collect a moodboard of Blue Lock panels to use as references
<GOOD> Ok I found almost the exact pose I was looking for
<GOOD> Obviously without the flashiness
<GOOD> Of course I am I physically can't avoid that
<GOOD> I physically can't avoid being too hard on myself, no
<GOOD> 2 really good ppl are playing smash and idk if I should join in
<GOOD> One is the person that destroyed me before
<GOOD> Nah, I'd lose
<GOOD> I'm not good at the game
<GOOD> And I feel like I'd just be inconveniencing
<GOOD> They're playing randoms
<GOOD> But I'm still just completely fucked
<GOOD> They are good at it
<GOOD> Wdym ans
<GOOD> I'll get pulverised
<GOOD> Not if I don't ask and inconvenience them by interrupting
<GOOD> I got completely shit on
<GOOD> Not really once it got down to 1v1s
<GOOD> Since I couldn't do anything about losing
<GOOD> I think I'm doing better than last time in my Pikmin run
<GOOD> 1
<GOOD> I'm about 15 days in with 5 parts left
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> Many lives lost but I made a net gain
<GOOD> It's official
<GOOD> I joined and lost literally everything happening today
<GOOD> I feel like shit
<GOOD> Ok nvm how do you calm down like, panic attack but angry
<GOOD> I'm walking home rn I need something else because when this walk ends idk what I'm gonna do
<GOOD> I'm full and I'm almost at my house
<GOOD> Something feels very wrong
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> I have the other 48 races of the 96 race marathon today
<GOOD> Back to Smash practice again I fucking guess
<GOOD> I'm so bad at this gameeee
<GOOD> Hate thjs
<GOOD> I still have no job
<GOOD> I have never had a job though
<GOOD> Kinda need to get my foot on the ladder
<GOOD> Joined a casual wii bowling tournament, immediately knocked out
<GOOD> I'm fucking tired man
<GOOD> Every single thing I join I lose constantly
<GOOD> Even if it's meant to be some casual shit I get stomped
<GOOD> Someone is just yelling right next to me for no reason
<GOOD> This is lovely
<GOOD> I think someone is spoiling Apollo Justice for me in this place rn lmao
<GOOD> No they're talking about 3D cutscenes and flaming homosexuals rn
<GOOD> Which sounds about right
<GOOD> Getting fucked up by lol lore rn
<GOOD> The gaming quiz was literally all about a shitton of Riot games
<GOOD> And I didn't know any of it
<GOOD> Yeah but it was kinda ass
<GOOD> Literally the only non-Riot questions were like: *plays Megalovania* what music is this
<GOOD> ZERO Pikmin questions
<GOOD> Did someone actually just fucking dab over knowing Bowser's theme in M64
<GOOD> Also it's like, in the character round they showed Kirby and then some random Valorant hero lmao
<GOOD> Or some insanely obscure MMO NPC
<GOOD> It was from a 2004 MMO called like Settlers of Kings lmao
<GOOD> Oh It's an RTS game
<GOOD> Settlers heritage of kings
<GOOD> In a MK8 tournament rn and in the first bracket I'm against the mario kart guy
<GOOD> I beat them and am onto the 2nd bracket
<GOOD> I placed 3rd in the tournament by fuckung myself over raaa
<GOOD> I'm mad but at least I won something
<GOOD> Keychain
<GOOD> First place was a plush but as I said combination of sucking ass at the game I consider myself best at and RNG fucked me over
<GOOD> It's a png of mario in a car
<GOOD> I'm getting into my room gimme a sec
<GOOD> Bear5
<GOOD> Also first place was a Yoshi plush so
<GOOD> Bear5 is the blue bear
<GOOD> No because gear 5 doesn't make me piss myself
<GOOD> Next marathon I'm gunning for that plushie
<GOOD> I have to respect the winner tho
<GOOD> He's like, the mario kart guy, super chill and he used Funky in the Mercedes Benz the entire time
<GOOD> The AI presidents play D&D!?
<GOOD> We are now in a dystopia
<GOOD> I should join the army...
<GOOD> I really wish I wanted to give Persona 5 another try
<GOOD> I also need to think of games I can actually enjoy
<GOOD> Someone spent the entire gaming marathon playing Lego LoTR lmao
<GOOD> What happened to the clay
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I think tomorrow I'm gonna play Banjo Kazooir
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Finally used a reference pic (2nd image) and it looks better
<GOOD> Although I think it has the learning perspective issue of making their arms super big
<GOOD> (The face was just so I could make more sense of the perspective)
<GOOD> I'm focusing on more masculine forms for now
<GOOD> I find them easier to draw since I see them more often
<GOOD> Nuh uh
<GOOD> I have an issue
<GOOD> Since I'm learning anatomy I started the early stages of drawing a character
<GOOD> And as it turns out I have a habit of drawing twinks really well compared to anything else I draw for some fucking reason
<GOOD> Idk what to draw next
<GOOD> I mean I am best at drawing slimmer characters (I don't know why)
<GOOD> I need to learn to draw musculature eventually anyway
<GOOD> Even if thin I gotta get the muscles right
<GOOD> Thank you twitter
<GOOD> I appreciate it
<GOOD> I love androgyny!!!!
<GOOD> Also I have had a recent obsession with these 2 kind of hats
<GOOD> Especially the 2nd one
<GOOD> I think I'm in the middle of that venn diagram between they/them and cool hat
<GOOD> So are the developer comments
<GOOD> Like I don't mind yucky content but weird shit = horror and the dev actively taunting people with it and making a fucking cry about it image crosses a line
<GOOD> I currently adore that hat
<GOOD> In response to criticisms of the most infamous plot point they made an image of the 2 siblings like this
<GOOD> Like this isn't some horror thing or even wow the characters are kinda fucked up
<GOOD> That's just weird
<GOOD> Idk, just lends to the game's dev being shitty
<GOOD> Yeah and if that dynamic were presented as bad and not haha uwu the silly siblings!!! Then sure that's fine
<GOOD> Being petty and making a pic like that is just taking a lot of the actual fucked-upness out of it lmao
<GOOD> Yeah but is there literally 0 inherent issue with not presenting it as bad at all
<GOOD> And making weird ass images like that
<GOOD> If it were the intended reaction of disgust then why would you mock people for having an issue with it
<GOOD> In relation to what
<GOOD> The 2 sibling characters being together? Like it wasn't made as that and didn't have any context to indicate that
<GOOD> The dev literally was just like cry about it the siblings are together which is like, gross as fuck
<GOOD> Well there's a reason it gained notoriety for specifically that sort of subject
<GOOD> It's almost like presenting cannibalism as a bad thing and not saying haha you're grossed out by eating human beings would go a long way
<GOOD> It's like Isayama mocking people for finding the every last scrap of Ymir panel gross
<GOOD> It's cannibalism, it's a horrid topic so it's discussed with a very gross tonal shift
<GOOD> Almost like owning relationships between siblings is something people look down on
<GOOD> Even then, this topic isn't horror
<GOOD> It's just ew why did you put this here
<GOOD> Like I'm not scared of this, it just makes me go oh
<GOOD> And then the dev response is just infuriating and weird
<GOOD> You can have this but it has to be handled right
<GOOD> I feel like a lot of those moments have to rely on the shock moment of oh this isn't right, like Kira in Jojo with his weird ass severed hands
<GOOD> Just presenting a non-horror but still gross topic as normal, then continuing to treat it as such both in and out of the game just makes it seem like you think it's normal
<GOOD> And that is a scary concept
<GOOD> Brother and sister kissing  isn't
<GOOD> Like you can do a lot with that concept of mind control
<GOOD> Is it one of those it's for their own good but actually just selfish and fucked up moments
<GOOD> The first thing that comes to mind for me is just memory erasure
<GOOD> Curating them or whatever
<GOOD> Junji Ito
<GOOD> I haven't actually read that novel yet though
<GOOD> I have yet to decide which Junji Ito story to read first
<GOOD> I wanna read that hole story
<GOOD> I need to know the context
<GOOD> Because the only shit I've seen is just Jojo shitposting for it
<GOOD> Yeah I'm reading it rn
<GOOD> It's rlly short it seems, I expected it to be a little longer
<GOOD> Oh shit that was a good story
<GOOD> Nice and short
<GOOD> Even the panels made me feel claustrophobic
<GOOD> I may read a lot of them
<GOOD> The final page was a perfect way to end it
<GOOD> I searched town without streets and it came up w a manga collection
<GOOD> Ig I'll read the whole collection
<GOOD> I think this collection is chronological because the art isn't quite there yet
<GOOD> Ok never fucking mind what
<GOOD> This story is a perfect presentation of that fucked up thing being shown as normal
<GOOD> She must have eaten a sandwich earlier
<GOOD> Jeez Ito's art is getting better
<GOOD> Like way better
<GOOD> I think I'm starting to lose my appetite reading all this
<GOOD> Oh I'm reading Junji Ito
<GOOD> Honestly I'm just too used to media I like being made by horrible people
<GOOD> (I have a streak with that kinda thing)
<GOOD> Off the top of my head, Toriko, Rurouni Kenshin, FNAF (kinda) and One Piece (maybe?) All had that happen
<GOOD> Oh and the IT Crowd but I kinda saw that one coming
<GOOD> Oda's mentor (the author of rurouni kenshin) has done very very very bad things and he has defended them over it, and he also has like a persona he puts on to answer reader questions that makes him sound pervy (although I assume he's laughing at himself and playing it up there)
<GOOD> Which is why I said maybe
<GOOD> Scott had that whole charity thing which is why it's iffy
<GOOD> Definitely didn't deserve the treatment he got because of it tho
<GOOD> He donated to some v bad political parties iirc
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> He also continues to fraternise with Watsuki iirc
<GOOD> Or used to
<GOOD> I'm unsure if he still does but still a horrible look for him
<GOOD> Oh the One Piece thing again
<GOOD> 2nd character design
<GOOD> Then don't start saying stuff about One Piece {ConcernedPoliwhirl}
<GOOD> It's Big Mom from One Piece
<GOOD> OP has plenty of diverse characters
<GOOD> People just fixate on the princesses too much
<GOOD> Yeah I'm fairly sure Amande has long-neck genes or whatever
<GOOD> Most of Big Mom's family all have super unique designs
<GOOD> It's a picture of a character
<GOOD> There isn't anything going on
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> The Charlotte family is basically Big Mom getting as many genes as humanly possible
<GOOD> So her family has people of almost every race
<GOOD> Apart from like, giants and Lunarians
<GOOD> And there are good reasons for both
<GOOD> And a few other races probably
<GOOD> She basically just wants to create a diverse happy family or something like that so she collects and dumps husbands constantly to have like 50+ kids
<GOOD> Mid and midder
<GOOD> I think this story is my favourite Tomie one so far
<GOOD> Finally lmao
<GOOD> I couldn't play the first because I only had 1 move controller
<GOOD> Parts and service was a nightmare lol
<GOOD> Yeah it looks awesome
<GOOD> Oof that Ito story hit a nerve or smth
<GOOD> I feel all weird
<GOOD> Yrsh
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I just feel really icky after that story
<GOOD> Well written since it was a horror story but it makes my skin crawl
<GOOD> Ito is a good writer yes
<GOOD> Idk what to get myself for Christmas
<GOOD> I'm getting the other 2 Pimin games but like, idk what else
<GOOD> Nothing I can't get at a supermarket
<GOOD> I'll think about that because my taste feels weird recently
<GOOD> I have no idea why but in general I've felt really off the past few days and idk why
<GOOD> Is it black friday yet
<GOOD> Oh also Nancy, it has to be a thing I can ask my parents for (ik I'm 18 but they apparently like and still want to get me a few gifts)
<GOOD> But I'll think ab indie titles
<GOOD> I was thinking of getting a GBA but it's kinda a waste
<GOOD> I know this sounds dumb but what is a thing I can buy that is both actually useful and also fun
<GOOD> And won't get tiring or redundant in like 5 seconds
<GOOD> Welcome back
<GOOD> I have to wear skinny jeans because basically all jeans that fit my waist are skinny
<GOOD> And they also don't feel that tight on me
<GOOD> It's not that great I can see so many ribs
<GOOD> Would you mind picking me up some clothes from the soup store
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I don't really like this Ito series
<GOOD> I'll finish it but it's not that good imo
<GOOD> I think the series is called Souichi
<GOOD> It's more like a comedy than anything else
<GOOD> I don't mind it but like it's overstayed its welcome
<GOOD> The chapters are basically just an asshole child being an asshole
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> But yeah the child is basically just being an ass to people and sometimes getting comeuppance
<GOOD> Maybe that's the issue
<GOOD> I am tired of this child
<GOOD> Like the first story was funny because at least the comeuppance was him getting nails through his face
<GOOD> Nah but that's the one I just finished
<GOOD> The very first one is where he tries attacking a girl with nails in his teeth like a vampire and she slaps him
<GOOD> So he gets stabbed through the cheek
<GOOD> I hate this child so much
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> I'm doing research rn into old gen distributions
<GOOD> Yeah his recent Jekyll and Hyde video was great
<GOOD> stopping myself
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> Actually for the comparative price tes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Same as this dude
<GOOD> He's an AVGN clone
<GOOD> Size of an average human mother
<GOOD> Tried dripping out the fella and it failed
<GOOD> Is there something especially wrong w the mom
<GOOD> Which is why I said especially
<GOOD> Yeah but cannibalism is like a worrying concept and not just yucky
<GOOD> I thought she was a teenager tbh, they dress like they listen to Radiohead
<GOOD> Do they listen to Radiohead
<GOOD> They should know better than to eat people then smh
<GOOD> Yeah I just assumed they were all shit people because they were
<GOOD> Summoning Salt
<GOOD> I also think eating people's liver is good
<GOOD> Rule 1 of gory horror: oooooo look at all this shock value aaaaahhh oooo
<GOOD> I mean when done badly yeah
<GOOD> Because it's just like boom now there's intenstines
<GOOD> It's like analog horror where it can be done good but a lot of them just flash scary faces and ambience
<GOOD> Intestine guy
<GOOD> I hope this series of Ito stories ends soon It's just a comedy manga {PikaHat}
<GOOD> Gory horror media creators after a long day of throwing meat chunks on the ground for singular jump cuts
<GOOD> Why is this gif so funny to me
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> That's me with eyes in gore horror, or skin
<GOOD> This is not related to me reading the skin peeling Junji Ito story yesterday
<GOOD> Promise
<GOOD> But that one actually made me feel icky because of things other than that not just the parts where it was gory
<GOOD> I once felt more ill at a description of surgery in a fucking five nights at freddy's book than a dungeon in Berserk lmao
<GOOD> I can fix them
<GOOD> Is she batman
<GOOD> Batman if she killed people...
<GOOD> I can fi-
<GOOD> Unfortunately for her I'm a serial rizzler
<GOOD> Convicted of 12 counts of being too awesome and cool
<GOOD> HxH is the only one of those I care about being on there fr
<GOOD> Oh is that why bro is on there
<GOOD> He's a weirdo
<GOOD> Eepy
<GOOD> Fairly sure that SAO has weird shit but I haven't watched it so
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Watched 1 episode and realised I didn't wanna watch more
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's like if Berserk had weird scenes with children but very very often to my knowledge
<GOOD> And more graphic
<GOOD> And unnecessary
<GOOD> I heard a lot worse
<GOOD> Like, Goblin Slayer ep 1 but with children
<GOOD> If this is in reference to MiA then that doesn't really hold up
<GOOD> Like there's only so many bad things you can show happening lmao
<GOOD> Hi chat Banjo Kazooie is fun
<GOOD> Also am I meant to get a game over when I save and quit
<GOOD> Rain World is 8
<GOOD> I might
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I am going to play more Banjo today
<GOOD> The machine is already fed
<GOOD> Now it is terrorising the other lanes
<GOOD> This is the best reaction image ofc
<GOOD> WDYM I DON'T CELEBRATE IT
<GOOD> Oh I thought you meant Christmas
<GOOD> Button
<GOOD> I'm losing my shit at these Christmas gifs and edits
<GOOD> I should stop now before I deplete all of them
<GOOD> Why isn't my twitter vid downloader working
<GOOD> That's very young for an elf
<GOOD> Banjo is awesome
<GOOD> I just wish the notes stayed after you die
<GOOD> I just beat Clanker's Cavern
<GOOD> Only ~85 notes gotten tho so I'll go back later for the rest
<GOOD> I love this pair
<GOOD> Just a smartass idiot and a dumbass idiot being besties
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I sorta know about that? But when it becomes relevant I'll probably have forgotten and pull up a list of her facts
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> That sucks
<GOOD> I might buy Rain World for 8
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> I won the MK8D 96 track marathon
<GOOD> I don't have stories for my OCs but they look pretty happy
<GOOD> At least in literally every drawing I or anyone else has ever made of them
<GOOD> I have a few other drawings of them and they always look like drawing 3
<GOOD> So I have to assume they got something nice going on
<GOOD> Is this the fucking
<GOOD> I ended up buying TGAA and the regular AA trilogy for 13
<GOOD> Since apparently having the original trilogy alongside is 1 more
<GOOD> At least now I have a few more games I want later
<GOOD> I think I bought some good games
<GOOD> Gmod, Base Isaac and TGAA is a good spread
<GOOD> Yeah TGAA and AA trilogy collectively 13
<GOOD> Awesome price
<GOOD> Also what gmod workshop things should I install
<GOOD> I downloaded the FNAF mods immediately and now I feel dirty
<GOOD> Why does my brain always default to Freddy
<GOOD> I love how they just kick it lmao
<GOOD> Wha
<GOOD> Rain World is gonna be fun af hopefully
<GOOD> But rn am doing some work on my new research proposal (I'm so excited to propose this oml)
<GOOD> Actually writing about shit I like makes me so passionate
<GOOD> Not really
<GOOD> Like Elon is probably fine if basically any of his companies go under
<GOOD> Maybe even all of them
<GOOD> Yeah I'm just saying he already has the money to live the rest of his life completely comfortably
<GOOD> Like he has so much fucking money, if he couldn't earn any more starting right now he'd probably live the rest of his life completely fine
<GOOD> Bot comments are so funny
<GOOD> I hope that Rain World feels good on controller
<GOOD> Imma try it later probably
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> That's good
<GOOD> I think I made a good investment for time
<GOOD> Domain Expansion
<GOOD> I bought like a whole profile makeover for 5000
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is this multiple games byw
<GOOD> Btw
<GOOD> I didn't even check lmao
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> I don't have that much in real money
<GOOD> They leaked Dream's phone number after his address lmao
<GOOD> He got a fuckin basketball court in that place
<GOOD> And like 9 bathrooms
<GOOD> I am already not strong enough so that happens to me often
<GOOD> I love pigeons
<GOOD> Are you shitting me
<GOOD> My lecturer is saying it's my fault that the person they made me work with isn't here and that it's my responsibility to motivate them
<GOOD> Like dude, I didn't want to team with anyone
<GOOD> For this particular one it's basically just 2 separate pieces of work combined
<GOOD> So we barely communicated anyway lmao
<GOOD> It's not my fucking job to make someone else work
<GOOD> Esp not someone I don't know
<GOOD> 3 minutes to talk about 2 PowerPoint slides I don't give a fuck about
<GOOD> Great
<GOOD> That's a pretty red dress
<GOOD> I dig the hair too
<GOOD> Sorry x_x
<GOOD> I didn't pay enough attention
<GOOD> I stared out the window during the whole oral presentation lmao
<GOOD> I mean that's not their fault
<GOOD> I'm just bad at giving oral presentations
<GOOD> Giving
<GOOD> I just have a habit of pacing and gesturing when I do stuff like that
<GOOD> Keeping in mind I didn't know what I was presenting for half of it since it wasn't mine
<GOOD> I just have a silence anyway because my small talk is atrocious
<GOOD> Takes like 2 seconds for me to run out of material
<GOOD> Idk if I have ADHD but I sure as hell get distracted every 4 seconds and need multiple stimuli to focus
<GOOD> This isn't like 2018
<GOOD> I don't think a spinner would work since I need a whole ass second activity
<GOOD> Like drawing
<GOOD> Closest stimuli I'd be able to have is like a lava lamp but I'm not bringing that to class
<GOOD> They also aren't really my type of fidget item
<GOOD> Then again I've never had a fidget item so
<GOOD> I just stim with my hands
<GOOD> I probably don't have ADHD so liks
<GOOD> ~~Then again my therapist has not responded so I wouldn't know~~
<GOOD> I've never had meds for anything
<GOOD> Which may be why I'm a bit fucked up
<GOOD> I've also never been tested or diagnosed for anything mental
<GOOD> You can't cure most mental things
<GOOD> Just offset and deal with them sorta
<GOOD> I don't think I can transition because like, I'm enby but there isn't much I can do to look more androgynous
<GOOD> I don't like presenting as fem and only present as masc sometimes
<GOOD> Or intend to
<GOOD> Just changing how I dress ig
<GOOD> Wearing more awesome jackets and baggy clothes fr
<GOOD> Also considering wearing beanies
<GOOD> I should buy a big ass jacket
<GOOD> I like jackets w hoods tbh
<GOOD> Also just randomly looking at images and this one goes hard af
<GOOD> I usually wear jeans and shirts since that's what I own
<GOOD> But someday I should absolutely buy more
<GOOD> Uh
<GOOD> I don't even know how to phrase it
<GOOD> I guess I'll just say clothes that give euphoria
<GOOD> Or help a little
<GOOD> I only own jeans and shirts ffs
<GOOD> I need moooore baggy trousers
<GOOD> I just don't like how they look, basically anything that ends at my knees I dislike
<GOOD> Shorts are a no-no as well unless I'm just chilling in my house
<GOOD> Yeah but like
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> I just don't feel that way
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Idfk finding fashion I like annoys me because I have no fashion sense
<GOOD> Frustrating af to not know what I want
<GOOD> P much
<GOOD> And when I try and figure out why I wouldn't like something I can't think of a reason except it just doesn't vibe w me
<GOOD> And that's a poor excuse
<GOOD> Can you like compress that into a pastebin or smth
<GOOD> Or in  and link to it
<GOOD> I need more baggy trousers like these raaa
<GOOD> I literally have 1 pair and they're kinda mid
<GOOD> My eyes ache
<GOOD> Also NOOOOO
<GOOD> Apollo
<GOOD> I bought base Isaac
<GOOD> It was 70p
<GOOD> And Repentance was a lot more I think
<GOOD> Guy who's only played Repentance playing any other Isaac version: hmm getting a lot of Repentance vibes from this one
<GOOD> Tbf I only got base because it was crazy cheap, I bought TGAA Chronicles with most of my 20 budget
<GOOD> I got it and the AA trilogy I owned on PS for 13 as a bundle
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> Hi chat I'm starting Rain World
<GOOD> I game overed already
<GOOD> Do you actually get punished for dying apart from being sent back
<GOOD> Idk what the cycle thing ks
<GOOD> Ohhh
<GOOD> I don't like
<GOOD> Understand how I'm meant to find shelter
<GOOD> I think I'm missing something already
<GOOD> Like, I can't ever get back to my house because I'm exploring trying to find a new house
<GOOD> Ok I'm officially lost lmao
<GOOD> I don't understand at all
<GOOD> I genuinely just don't get it
<GOOD> I've explored so much of the map and have actually made it back a singular time
<GOOD> I haven't even found any shelter
<GOOD> 8
<GOOD> Nah it's decent, I just have to learn
<GOOD> Some of the stuff isn't communicated to you and it's a lot of trial and error
<GOOD> I just got to Drainage System
<GOOD> So some progress has been made
<GOOD> I've killed 1 thing so far
<GOOD> Unsure if I can even kill larger predators
<GOOD> Rain World fun
<GOOD> I just need to get way better at movements
<GOOD> I've never watched Dr Who
<GOOD> That dalek do be spitting tho
<GOOD> The lore is so fucked and then you look at them and they look like novelty phone booths or smth
<GOOD> Are they genuinely unable to climb stairs btw
<GOOD> The first thing I thought of was them helicoptering the plunger blaster part lmaooo
<GOOD> That's terrifying wtf
<GOOD> Also is Dr Who like pseudo-comedy
<GOOD> Where is Moe
<GOOD> Worst trilogy then
<GOOD> Where is Furio Tigre
<GOOD> (Peak fellow)
<GOOD> And don't tell me that they forgot about my husband Victor Kudo
<GOOD> Yeah and he's handsome frfr
<GOOD> What a scrunkly pookie bear
<GOOD> I should rlly try this
<GOOD> My friend just showed me the scene where the doctor just tells someone to kill themselves and that's all I've seen of it
<GOOD> And that clip you just sent
<GOOD> I caved and bought 3 Rayman Legends
<GOOD> I remember loving Origins on 360 so I decided why not
<GOOD> I spent 20
<GOOD> Like almost exactly which is why I bought Rayman
<GOOD> I was also recommended to play Rayman Redemption if I wanted to play the old Rayman
<GOOD> I also downloaded Redemption, N64 Rayman 2 and GC Rayman 3
<GOOD> Just in case I feel like it
<GOOD> I don't get it, how am I meant to build reputation when I have no items and they all fucking hate me
<GOOD> Ok I kinda understand it now
<GOOD> I wish I could have a holiday
<GOOD> But no job and no money for the next few years
<GOOD> I have a headache
<GOOD> When we made it public
<GOOD> Also I don't think google will help lmao
<GOOD> Well yeah lol, there's not really any issue with needing google for that part
<GOOD> Well ig I give up on Rain World for now
<GOOD> I can't make any progress and even when talking to people in the server for the game it just isn't working
<GOOD> Also I made Rain World story progress holy shit
<GOOD> Where is Handy Dan
<GOOD> Is he safe?
<GOOD> The completely unfitting random violin stings layered over the song is so funny
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Maybe that's why I was ass at compsci
<GOOD> Rain World is hard
<GOOD> I'm so cold and sleepy
<GOOD> I love Rain World raa
<GOOD> I'm officially in the midgame
<GOOD> Just buy it smh
<GOOD> It's worth
<GOOD> Skibidi dop dop dop
<GOOD> I think the new meme is that whistling one but it's more of a tiktok thing so
<GOOD> I've only seen it when it bleeds over
<GOOD> Yeah lmao
<GOOD> I saw a clip that was one of those roblox survival horror games with a png of that thing there
<GOOD> We don't have our own memes
<GOOD> Oh right
<GOOD> I don't remember big man shaq
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah that wasn't funny
<GOOD> We don't have our own often
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> They called Araki a 4 on their scale I can never forgive them
<GOOD> New promo art for OP anime raaa
<GOOD> I love the style
<GOOD> I'm almost done with Rain World I think
<GOOD> I'm at least late game
<GOOD> I mean you die if you're standing in the rain because it's so heavy
<GOOD> So yes
<GOOD> Didn't you say that earlier
<GOOD> Doctor Proboun...
<GOOD> This is the funniest shit
<GOOD> Can't believe the cult of Beep/Meep pronouns have invaded the BBC...
<GOOD> Freckles are cool
<GOOD> Then take it, hope this helps!
<GOOD> Also my hair looks awesome today
<GOOD> I wish it had a bit more lift but tbf it does sometimes
<GOOD> Plus I never have to actually do anything to it and it just does this on its own
<GOOD> My friend told me to dye it white
<GOOD> It's probably my only good feature
<GOOD> It's like 2 minutes of shampooing
<GOOD> Cool eye shadow
<GOOD> Teal is such a banger colour
<GOOD> Niiice
<GOOD> I have no freckles
<GOOD> Also I'm now considering dying my hair white at some point, no idea how it would go
<GOOD> The him in question:
<GOOD> (My hair actually looks like that when I tuck it back)
<GOOD> Um uhhh
<GOOD> I didn't know that HRT gave you freckles but that's neat
<GOOD> I have a pretty angled chin
<GOOD> I don't like it
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> I wish I had that cool hairstyle
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Apollo I have beaten Rain World so now I'm trying TGAAC later
<GOOD> They will never be Turnabout Big Top
<GOOD> My GOAT would never
<GOOD> Ignore that he did
<GOOD> I started my Hunter playthrough of Rain World
<GOOD> I beat it today, honestly Rain World can be way too unfair sometimes
<GOOD> Like I'm saying this from as objective a standpoint as I can since I play hard games often
<GOOD> But RW can get really unfair at times
<GOOD> I don't own it on PC still
<GOOD> Eepy
<GOOD> Gl
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I feel like shit again today
<GOOD> It has spinal fluid
<GOOD> Idk about marrow
<GOOD> Yummy
<GOOD> You can have all of mine I won't need it
<GOOD> I will simply drain it out into a large canister for someone else then
<GOOD> Scared of needles, I'll donate my shit when I'm dead
<GOOD> I already have my organs prepped to be donated
<GOOD> Because then I'll be too dead to think about it
<GOOD> Clocking in for my organ harvesting appointment
<GOOD> If someone bites your neck enough to draw blood changes are it's your jugular
<GOOD> *chances
<GOOD> I'd end up as a rat
<GOOD> Wererats are not tho
<GOOD> Also do you guys have any advice for like, not just snowballing from oh a single mistake to you are fucking awful do horrible things
<GOOD> I forgot to buy frozen burgers for lunch yesterday and it's been 2 hours and I now hate myself and can barely keep my head up in class lmao
<GOOD> I wish I could go home and do that
<GOOD> What the fuck is so confusing
<GOOD> My only friend isn't here
<GOOD> I can't communicate that very well I also don't have diagnosed anxiety
<GOOD> Self diagnosis is a slippery slope
<GOOD> Yeah but like it's not my professor's fault I can't pay attention
<GOOD> Something shit happened earlier in the day and like, they can't accommodate for that
<GOOD> I just
Don't know how to convey it
<GOOD> I don't have panic attacks often and do I just tell them oh I randomly just have harmful thoughts because of random small things
<GOOD> Unfortunately my therapist just hasn't responded after my last checkup so that's not great
<GOOD> Like they sent an email like how are you and I said I'd need more help and they haven't responded in a few weeks so
<GOOD> Reaching out ain't been going too well
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Mmm I love no motivation or enjoyment for weeks on end
<GOOD> Can't even email someone
<GOOD> Those are the people I just said didn't respond
<GOOD> I got given enough of a push to get therapy, then they didn't respond after my 2nd session
<GOOD> Few weeks
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> I barely had the energy to initially ask for it
<GOOD> I'm not confrontational enough to annoy people for days on end
<GOOD> I do it by accident
<GOOD> Only 11 chapters until One Piece chapter 1111
<GOOD> I don't have nitro so I can't convey it
<GOOD> I wish I was good at games
<GOOD> I can't enjoy them
<GOOD> I don't really know what other ways I can try
<GOOD> I'm barely good enough at games to do them base
<GOOD> Let alone challenges
<GOOD> Sometimes 100% things are absolutely diabolical
<GOOD> Like rain world, this game is so fucking unfair
<GOOD> I'm trying a Hunter (hard mode) run and they just started making the game straight up unfair
<GOOD> I beat Normal
<GOOD> And in the 2nd area of the game I was attacked by 5 late game enemies
<GOOD> At the same time
<GOOD> And I can't even beat 1 of them
<GOOD> Yeah but I'm fine with the odds are against you not it's fucking impossible
<GOOD> They literally gave an already difficult enemy 2 laser guided ranged attacks
<GOOD> And then threw 5 of them at mw
<GOOD> Yes, and hard mode exclusive ones that are even harder
<GOOD> These things are awful
<GOOD> Hate them
<GOOD> They're King Vultures
<GOOD> They're the same as normal vultures but stronger, more HP and 2 ranged attacks for some reason
<GOOD> Also the area you fight them in looks like this with insta death pits
<GOOD> The red thing is the bird, the black things are pipes and platforms, and the oval is you byw
<GOOD> The birds are massive and can very easily just knock you off
<GOOD> Also everything in this game kills you in 1 hit
<GOOD> It dies to being hit by a spear 12 times, in hard mode you can carry a max of 2
<GOOD> And you have to throw them, and it gets lodged in the bird so you have to jump near them to take a spear out
<GOOD> Also sometimes they just fly away after 6 hits or so
<GOOD> And take your spears
<GOOD> Also they have the laser guided ranged attacks
<GOOD> And there can be up to 4 or 5 of them at once
<GOOD> Not to mention the other types of enemies also present
<GOOD> And like
<GOOD> Oh also if you die you get sent back massively and these sort of encounters happen very often
<GOOD> Oh also the vultures will very often get pissed off and slam their body directly into you
<GOOD> Oh also this is one screen of an area that is dozens of screens long and death is actively punishing to you
<GOOD> And in the Hunter campaign you physically cannot eat anything you didn't kill yourself apart from like 1 very rare plant
<GOOD> And you'll starve if you don't collect enough food every 10 minutes or so
<GOOD> So you have to kill these enemies lmao
<GOOD> The expectation is that you catch a lizard alone and spear it to death then eat it
<GOOD> (Also some platforming in the game REQUIRES unexplained tech)
<GOOD> And they don't convey that
<GOOD> And those jumps have to be pixel perfect
<GOOD> Usually under duress because you're being attacked while doing them
<GOOD> The Leyley creator got doxxed?
<GOOD> That sucks, doxxing is ass
<GOOD> The comments section though...
<GOOD> Yucky people
<GOOD> I don't like the game but swatting/doxxing is just evil
<GOOD> Ok so like
<GOOD> Apparently Rain World's hard mode has a time limit
<GOOD> And if you exceed it your entire run of the game just like, ends
<GOOD> Should i play TGAA Chronicles
<GOOD> Also I wanna buy Rain World DLC but I'm restraining myself
<GOOD> Soyjak pointing rn
<GOOD> Yeah I love it
<GOOD> YES!
<GOOD> It's p good so far but only 5 minutes in
<GOOD> Holy shit an actual reason I have to prove someone other than the defendant guilty
<GOOD> Never thought I'd see the day
<GOOD> These names have me cackling already
<GOOD> Kyurio Kurekuta the antique salesman
<GOOD> So true
<GOOD> No fucking way man
<GOOD> This is from Twitter because I autoplay'd over the dialogue but like
<GOOD> Come the fuck on
<GOOD> This is the story of a man named Stanley
<GOOD> Doesn't he force you to wait if you rush in the boss' office
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> No idea how to do that one
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Can you play for an entire Tuesday by date skipping
<GOOD> Is this ultra deluxe or normal
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Yeah and the impossible achievement is possible
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> They have bad memory tbf
<GOOD> They aren't elephants, they never forget
<GOOD> True!
<GOOD> Many such cases!
<GOOD> The lions have the lion zone
<GOOD> Do-mane expansion
<GOOD> Ngl I don't think that Goku could beat a billion lions
<GOOD> That's too many
<GOOD> Not if it's not in his list of things
<GOOD> Maxwell can only create so many things
<GOOD> Omni man Jesus crucifix image
<GOOD> Jesus has a powerscaling wiki entry and it's so funny
<GOOD> Because they're like Jesus has the attack strength of a regular man, but he's actually Outerversal because God
<GOOD> You need at least 30 billion Spongebobs to kill 1 Goku
<GOOD> Tbf being faster than light is a standard in powerscaling which fucking sucks lmao
<GOOD> And then you have people that fast being speedblitzed
<GOOD> Dragonball and its irreparable damage to Shonen
<GOOD> Moonbusting Roshi has genuinely ruined powerscaling forever
<GOOD> I usually assume flat plane, fight to the death
<GOOD> And sometimes equipment
<GOOD> Either that or just like, Earth
<GOOD> Saitama clears
<GOOD> Goku doesn't kill his enemies immediately
<GOOD> Goku can't either what
<GOOD> Neither of them can breathe in space
<GOOD> Frieza prob clears Saitama
<GOOD> The only reason Goku/Vegeta lose is that they play with their food
<GOOD> Geno whirl kills Beerus immediately
<GOOD> Mumen Rider vs Senor Pink
<GOOD> They're a chad
<GOOD> *justice crash
<GOOD> Seen it
<GOOD> It reminds me of the Goku no ACoC??? Meme
<GOOD> Goku also loses to Luffy because he's made of rubber ofc
<GOOD> Toriko also screams Toriko punch
<GOOD> And the dragon was like
<GOOD> He used his Gold haki to Krieg diff Luffy
<GOOD> Not after the lions pull the Do-mane expansion
<GOOD> Lion Cleave
<GOOD> Also Spoon read OP 1100
<GOOD> This game
<GOOD> Yeah I'm saying TGAA is the game I sent
<GOOD> Do you know Phoenix Wright
<GOOD> Phoenix Wright is the main character of Ace Attorney
<GOOD> Ace Attorney is like, 30% point and click adventure, 70% playable visual novel
<GOOD> You play as a lawyer
<GOOD> Yeah but it's unique since you have to unravel a case with drip fed evidence in high pressure situations
<GOOD> Also it's completely off the wall
<GOOD> Literally turnabout Big Top
<GOOD> Especially the motivation lmao
<GOOD> HUH!?
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> Ykw is genuinely good
<GOOD> Yooo I'm almost there
<GOOD> The case is *almost* unravelling
<GOOD> I GOT IT
<GOOD> EUREKA
<GOOD> Nah it's also a real sound clip
<GOOD> But Edgeworth says it in a spinoff game so
<GOOD> I made the connection before the game could catch up raaagh
<GOOD> Nah I'm only 1 step ahead
<GOOD> Jeez this first case is long
<GOOD> It's very cold in Wales rn
<GOOD> Wait does that mean I'm mandated to
<GOOD> Pikmin 1 and 2 and Pikmin 3 
Pikmin new play control for the Wii
<GOOD> I want one
<GOOD> I can't stop listening to it
<GOOD> Finally finished case 1 of TGAA
<GOOD> Any defense attorney's case when a character doesn't shit themself over a single slip of the tongue
<GOOD> Pretty
<GOOD> It isn't December here yet
<GOOD> Look at me, do you really think I don't want that
<GOOD> I can't wait that long
<GOOD> It's now December here
<GOOD> So many of my Christmas gifs are borderline NSFW and I can't tell if I can send them
<GOOD> They have edits of NSFW things made SFW
<GOOD> Also I created a pfp layer
<GOOD> Oh shit
<GOOD> I really should draw a seasonal outfit for them
<GOOD> Just can't think of anything special :((
<GOOD> I downloaded Rayman Redemption
<GOOD> Apparently it's better than normal Rayman 1 so I'm trying it
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I've never watched it but yes
<GOOD> Rayman is the next franchise I'm trying, I've already beaten Origins, have Legends downloaded, and have Rayman Redemption, 2 and 3
<GOOD> Rayman is cool but I never paid attention to him
<GOOD> It seems like people never talk about him
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Probably the most based game protag yet
<GOOD> They made the boot up someone screaming opera GX for 1 day and people are being incredibly angry about it for some reason
<GOOD> But tbf the people mad about it also won't matter to the company so
<GOOD> Yeah but now ppl are like, incredibly fucking mad for some reason
<GOOD> And I have no idea why, like it's gonna scare you a little bit once ever
<GOOD> Ok but that's funny
<GOOD> Also no one losing shit over their phone screaming OPERA GX at them once, and if they were they prob should have had their volume off
<GOOD> Mild annoyance
<GOOD> People say it's spyware (what browser isn't) and it apparently has good QoL stuff that others don't
<GOOD> At least speaking in terms of GX and not normal Opera
<GOOD> Tbh my data is getting stolen literally every 5 seconds so idc if the Chinese government knows that I like Pikmin
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It also has customisable sound effects which is p neat
<GOOD> Like the UK government knows my shit already, doesn't really make a difference if the Chinese government does
<GOOD> Yeah but extensions are kinda annoying and Opera GX cuts that part
<GOOD> So it's just mildly more convenient to have that stuff built in
<GOOD> Yeah pretty much
<GOOD> But then people latched onto it collecting more user data than non-chromium based browsers
<GOOD> But like your data is being siphoned off anyway so who cares
<GOOD> Ok but like, what are they gonna do with it
<GOOD> All my data is getting stolen anyway lmao
<GOOD> Oh no, rich corporations I can't affect are making slightly more money
<GOOD> Like who cares, they're gonna take my data and they're gonna sell it so may as well just do the more fun thing
<GOOD> Good
<GOOD> HOLY FUCK WHAT
<GOOD> Waluigi's creator showed off original art for Wapeach
<GOOD> From Mario Power Tennis apparently
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> She was meant to accompany Wario and Waluigi
<GOOD> Awesome
<GOOD> Wish my face was softer
<GOOD> Also I cut myself like twice every time I shave
<GOOD> (It's not really a big deal tho)
<GOOD> Fairly sure mine is like, pretty fair and soft already but not as much
<GOOD> I should buy a leg shaver
<GOOD> Speaking of dysphoria I need to shave my face
<GOOD> I just cover my arms and legs because I'm worried about shaving them
<GOOD> Yeah but it matters like a lot to me, esp legs x_x
<GOOD> Even though I never wear shorts
<GOOD> Oh I know which is why I'm never doing electolysis
<GOOD> Too expensive
<GOOD> Currently just living with the off chance I see my own legs and have a slump in my mood instead
<GOOD> Or like, brush my face by accident and I feel my beard hair
<GOOD> I need one
<GOOD> The one I have rn has a broken piece so I can't use it
<GOOD> Unless I want every hair individually pulled out of my face
<GOOD> Oh it also gets stuck
<GOOD> I tried using it once and that's how I found out it wasn't working
<GOOD> Haven't told mine
<GOOD> Probably never will
<GOOD> How much for a laser session where I can be strapped to a metal table and the laser dramatically moves towards me, threatening to cut me in half
<GOOD> If I set myself on fire all the hair will be removed
<GOOD> Nah I'll just tell the plutonium to highly ionise deez nuts
<GOOD> Wait gamma radiation is low ionising
<GOOD> I can kinda take phone calls now
<GOOD> Still no job
<GOOD> However I might apply for a quick 10 an hour job in January
<GOOD> Literally just standing there handing out flyers for a few days
<GOOD> The thing is these are coupon flyers
<GOOD> So basically all I have to do is go do you want free shit
<GOOD> And them avoiding me is good because like, who's gonna ask me questions about fuckin Domino's vouchers lmao
<GOOD> Literally not even that
<GOOD> Do you want free pizza
If they approach me, hand them one
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> This an official model too
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Apparently they never made a design for her
<GOOD> They were discussed though
<GOOD> Wario fart
<GOOD> Wasalina would be the end for me
<GOOD> Conversely anything above a 7 is also dreadful
<GOOD> This is so truw
<GOOD> Also IGN has never rated Pikmin anything lower than a 9 lmao
<GOOD> Apart from Hey Pikmin but that isn't mainline
<GOOD> Jesus people are still complaining about the Opera thing
<GOOD> Marketing working
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Bon nuit... Bon nuit to you all
<GOOD> I now have 30 Christmas related reaction images in a folder
<GOOD> Why is this that one room from the DMC cutscene
<GOOD> Is he going to be the one to fill her dark soul with light
<GOOD> Snake and Peter Griffin are the BP
<GOOD> Good news
<GOOD> This is the only MGS media I've ever consumed
<GOOD> Apart from like, Snake in Smash
<GOOD> Guys... Psycho Mantis
<GOOD> (Scary)
<GOOD> I should actually play MGS
<GOOD> Apparently it's funny as you ssid
<GOOD> Might emulate eventually
<GOOD> I'm reading rn tho
<GOOD> I actually just main Toons in YGO
<GOOD> Toon table is fucking amazing
<GOOD> Yeah I don't like Magic Library FTK
<GOOD> I usually play Treasure Panda ftk
<GOOD> But ye Toon Table is a good milling card
<GOOD> Since you basically just reduce the amount of cards in your deck below the minimum for 1 card
<GOOD> That's what they're made for smh
<GOOD> You either Turbo Chaos MAX or die
<GOOD> They had to unfortunately
<GOOD> Apparently Bird is the Word is Peter's emote
<GOOD> So the Waluigi creator that showed off Wapeach has deleted the posts and privated his IG
<GOOD> That's just Boshi
<GOOD> If you're on a talk show(?) shouting at people over a business decision while the scrolling caption on the bottom says I am NOT an antisemite then you know you fucked up somewhere
<GOOD> Ughhh I have science block
<GOOD> I finished 1 project but my other one I don't have many ideas for
<GOOD> Hi chat playing Big Run rn
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Scary af
<GOOD> Have you heard the scream
<GOOD> It's the teeth
<GOOD> My high score is 131
<GOOD> I need that gold
<GOOD> No I just got 14 bronze
<GOOD> But I'm talking about eggs
<GOOD> Cool pfp
<GOOD> Ughhhh I can't get a win anymore to spawn the king salmonid
<GOOD> Oooo it's cute
<GOOD> I like your current more
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> We died when Mega's health was like, 2%
<GOOD> I'm mad
<GOOD> Like actually pissed
<GOOD> I hate when this happens
<GOOD> I get mad and it just ruins my day
<GOOD> Ughhhhhhhhh
<GOOD> We died to fucking flyfish man
<GOOD> I hate them sm
<GOOD> We had that shit in the bag
<GOOD> I'm slipping again it's happening :((
<GOOD> Very loud noise warning
<GOOD> I have no peers
<GOOD> I don't have it installed
<GOOD> I wanna tho for peter
<GOOD> Actually sure
<GOOD> Yeah but I gotta complete it
<GOOD> Probably what I'm gonna do
<GOOD> I've never completed one
<GOOD> Oh also if I just log in on my epic account will it give me my PS4 shit
<GOOD> PC
<GOOD> Also it keeps saying there was a timeout whenever I try and log in
<GOOD> To try and download
<GOOD> This is annoying af
<GOOD> I'M VISITING IT TOO FREQUENTLY APPARENTLY
<GOOD> FYM I WOULDN'T IF YOU WEREN'T SO SHIT
<GOOD> FUCK THIS, MAN
<GOOD> It's just such bullshit
<GOOD> Can't even install shit without a brand new installer that doesn't fucking work
<GOOD> And I have a billion accounts so I have to constantly watch out I don't accidentally erase my entire FN account
<GOOD> Because my PlayStation was where I played it, so it created an account for me there I assume
<GOOD> And that account isn't the same as the account I put my personal email into I assume
<GOOD> I have no idea
<GOOD> Because it was that long ago
<GOOD> Hey that's a great idea, I'll log into the Epic games account
<GOOD> The one I CAN'T LOG INTO BECAUSE THE SERVICE IS BEING SHIT
<GOOD> Great
<GOOD> Epic
<GOOD> I was just trying to download the game
<GOOD> Ffs this stupid gum pain is flaring up again
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> I'm upset
<GOOD> At myself and in general
<GOOD> I have no idea what's causing the pain
<GOOD> It's like a swelling in my mouth kinda near my gum
<GOOD> And it has like, a slit in it?
<GOOD> And the slit has like white on it and it doesn't rub off
<GOOD> So idk
<GOOD> It's like, running alongside them
<GOOD> Like this
<GOOD> Already have been gargling
<GOOD> Yeh
<GOOD> Hot salt water
<GOOD> Yeah I'm just concerned because there's never been like a slit with a white surface before
<GOOD> I wanna play more big run because it's fun but I'm also worried
<GOOD> Few days
<GOOD> Like, 2
<GOOD> Also a bit of swelling under my jaw where it is but that's been going down
<GOOD> It happens when I get a cold sometimes so it's nbd
<GOOD> It's been chilly the last few days but like, it happens
<GOOD> I mean the spot seemed detached before and now it feels like it's going back into place or whatever
<GOOD> God I want Rain World DLC rn
<GOOD> I wanna play the perfect specimen
<GOOD> I beat base game
<GOOD> And Hunter is too hard for me because they have a time limit where if you exceed it your save gets deleted
<GOOD> Eh it's the hard mode
<GOOD> But basically you have like, 10 minutes per cycle to find food, rest, travel and find more shelter
<GOOD> And you have like 10 cycles to beat the game
<GOOD> I only have 1 friend I see sometimes, and I haven't talked to my old friends in ages
<GOOD> And recently lots of stuff just upsets me super easily
<GOOD> Anyway I love these silly billies
<GOOD> I wanna play as all of them
<GOOD> I miss having a friend group
<GOOD> I have decided to play Gourmand first, then the spear one, then the aquatic one, Artificer and then the Saint because he sucks
<GOOD> The saint literally can't throw a spear correct
<GOOD> I might buy Downpour soon then
<GOOD> I wanna play Gourmand, the spear one and the aquatic one
<GOOD> Esp the Gourmand and spear one
<GOOD> And everything else apparently
<GOOD> Also stunned for longer by things
<GOOD> I don't think it dies to a rock tho
<GOOD> It was on sale a few days ago
<GOOD> Also Nancy do you have the DLC
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> I wanna buy the DLC and then do a Monk playthrough
<GOOD> Since it changes a lot about the game and Monk is like Surv if it was a little more chill
<GOOD> Ughhhh the boss screams in Splat 3 are so goooodddd (volume warningggg)
<GOOD> I think Megalodontia may have my new favourite
<GOOD> It reminds me of that bird gif
<GOOD> Also I feel better
<GOOD> Sorta
<GOOD> Sorry about earlier
<GOOD> Too often in my case :((
<GOOD> I haven't killed them yet :((
<GOOD> Makes me wanna start grinding SR for outfits again tho
<GOOD> I need a slopsuit
<GOOD> Yes sir/ma'am (I forgor)
<GOOD> It's my new favourite in general too
<GOOD> Also Coho is my hardest by far
<GOOD> Oh oki
<GOOD> I didn't know your gender or pronouns anyway but that's on me for not checking your profile
<GOOD> Boo womp
<GOOD> Fnaf world 2 peak
<GOOD> WOKE thief be like... PRONOUN stealing...
<GOOD> This will be burglary in 2023...
<GOOD> You can have my spare he/him I threw away
<GOOD> But the they/them is mine, BUSTER
<GOOD> I'm about to lose it
<GOOD> I think it was rigged
<GOOD> It's out there already
<GOOD> Putting this on Sasuke
<GOOD> Raaaaagh actually productive work today
<GOOD> I got like most of my 2nd project done and I have 8 days to do the rest
<GOOD> XQC
<GOOD> Oh right I've been recommended hbomberguy
<GOOD> I just didn't watch it
<GOOD> In my FNAF nostalgia era rn
<GOOD> Goes hard
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> James hasn't done much bad tho
<GOOD> Afaik AVGN hasn't had much controversy
<GOOD> I thought he wrote them himself or at least helped w them
<GOOD> His content isn't really the same content, it's more Scott the Woz esque content
<GOOD> Plagiarised from where
<GOOD> I don't understand what's being plagiarised here, like was there a Cinemassacre script he stole?
<GOOD> But James was pretty scripted from the start
<GOOD> Politics?
<GOOD> Damn I must have missed some episodes
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Oh great everyone sucks
<GOOD> I'm just pretty tired of waking up, finding out anything I like has something shit going on behind it, and giving up for the day
<GOOD> Like don't support this, also don't pirate it or talk about it or literally anything because it gives money to bad people
<GOOD> But the people telling me that are mostly white-knighting and forget about it in a week
<GOOD> Yeah but apparently the big companies profit off piracy too so
<GOOD> Now you shouldn't consume the media at all
<GOOD> I love Quora
<GOOD> Time for a bit of big run grinding
<GOOD> Yeah but it says server offline for me
<GOOD> I have it downloaded tho
<GOOD> Oh god today is doing bad
<GOOD> I'm getting so many bad waves
<GOOD> Oh my god now ppl are just leaving at the beginninggggg
<GOOD> Like cmon man
<GOOD> DUDE
<GOOD> WHY IS IT SO HARD ALL OF A SUDDEN WTF
<GOOD> OH MY GODDDD
<GOOD> I just wanna win once
<GOOD> When are thsy
<GOOD> FUCK YEAH MEGALODONTIA IS DEAD
<GOOD> I GOT 4 GOLD SCALES
<GOOD> I used them to buy a life jacket
<GOOD> Yeah but now I'm getting my ass kicked so
<GOOD> It makes me so annoyed because like, I got to them and immediately we wiped because 2 of us died at once :/
<GOOD> So I got 6 scales from that encounter
<GOOD> I'm literally pinned constantly too
<GOOD> I suck at SR
<GOOD> Sometimes you reaaaaaally get a bad experience from RNG
<GOOD> Like I had a wave where they exclusively spawned scrappers, slammin lids and flyfish with the sniper enemies too
<GOOD> And they all kept hanging back
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> Just unfortunate because I don't wanna drop from EVP
<GOOD> I mean like, slamming lids staying at the back behind waves and waves of cohocks
<GOOD> And since the slammin lids keep spawning cohocks and scrappers don't stop boxing you in you can't get anything done
<GOOD> Oh fr? That's good
<GOOD> Also I'm doing so ass when I get given bamboozlers, squiffers, and some splatlings
<GOOD> I'm waiting till later to queue login
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I also have one huge issue where I will dive stingers if no one gets them for a while
<GOOD> Yeah but on high tide on that certain back part of the map they can come out the spawner and camp the little platforms
<GOOD> And the middle part can get choked up
<GOOD> Yeah they do but as I said the middle can be choked up with Cohocks if you aren't careful
<GOOD> I haven't gotten silver scales yet in this SR lmao
<GOOD> Only bronze and 1 gold
<GOOD> *4
<GOOD> But it was 1 drop of 4
<GOOD> I love the grizz blaster raaagh
<GOOD> Ok like someone in the gaming society just keeps talking while playing, and I'm usually good with that but he keeps trying to do Marvel 1 liners over everything
<GOOD> He just said that was totally... epical 100.. yeah
<GOOD> I changed my account and I have 10 minutes left on queue
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Keep in mind I play zero build and I play to just chill and have fun
<GOOD> I won't go kill chasing unless I feel like it
<GOOD> Like, I literally just fish sometimes lmao
<GOOD> But not this time dw
<GOOD> If you want idk
<GOOD> I just gotta see if it even works first
<GOOD> how do I unlock Snake
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> My account link worked btw
<GOOD> It's like a page ON the battle pass, but separate to everything else
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh god the Peter Griffin dance is in the bonus rewards
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Page 2
<GOOD> 3
<GOOD> Also how do I screen record
<GOOD> Nvm I just opted to do this,  lmao
<GOOD> I have Green Goblin lmao one sec
<GOOD> Green Goblin after he kills Peter's entire family
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> We can play if you want but I'll be quest hunting probably
<GOOD> If we VC I may be mute btw
<GOOD> I turned it off by default
<GOOD> Does it still let me hear you if we party
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> Don't laugh
<GOOD> The_infinite_oof
<GOOD> (It was when I was 14 and I used my 1 rename)
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Wait who is this
<GOOD> What happened
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> I didn't know I could
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> How do I choose
<GOOD> Vill you're party leader now
<GOOD> Go for it
<GOOD> Why is my screen too small
<GOOD> Annoying af
<GOOD> I don't know
<GOOD> This is what I was afraid ooffffff
<GOOD> Sucking ass constantly
<GOOD> I'm taking a break for a bit or just playing solo
<GOOD> Sorry I'm just kinda annoyed and I have smth to do
<GOOD> My PC is lagging and it doesn't help that I'm just ass
<GOOD> So I may as well grind quests alone
<GOOD> I'm sorry
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> I'm dragging it down
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I can't take being this shitty mentally anymore
<GOOD> I keep making an ass out of myself in front of potential friends
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Do these even work
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ugh I'm so baaaad
<GOOD> I got to lv 5 I guess I'll stop for now
<GOOD> I'm being hard on myself over everything
<GOOD> I can't help it
<GOOD> Like genuinely I'm just afraid of underperforming
<GOOD> And like you're a new friend and I don't wanna embarrass myself
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Comparatively to my longer standing friends, you are a new friend
<GOOD> I've been trying not to stress drink
<GOOD> How do I even get this thing
<GOOD> Unless they're prescription ig
<GOOD> I think the strongest drug I've ever taken is like, a pint of beer
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> I'm only tier 5 but I've almost gotten all my weeklies done
<GOOD> Are the tiers evenly spaced
<GOOD> Fantastic
<GOOD> I wonder if I can just search up exp map
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Daily?
<GOOD> Can I ask why
<GOOD> Ok so what are examples of creative maps that give exp
<GOOD> Then what's the purpose of it
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> If it's an idle clicker game then what differentiates it from a map where you click a button over and over
<GOOD> I must grind the fortnite
<GOOD> I wish I had meow skulls as-
<GOOD> Actually I'm not gonna sabotage myself like that
<GOOD> Meow Skulls is just pretty
<GOOD> Mah waif
<GOOD> (I'm joking if that wasn't obvious)
<GOOD> Do tycoon maps give exp
<GOOD> Or at least a lot
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Idk what I'm looking for tbh
<GOOD> I'm already in
<GOOD> I just don't know what to do
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I just don't know what maps to play
<GOOD> Also can I play a private version of a public map
<GOOD> Omfg I'm not playing skibidi tycoon
<GOOD> But... why not zero build?
<GOOD> But look at this, it's Meowskulls
<GOOD> It's the thing you just referenced Vill
<GOOD> Sure but I gotta make hot chocolate and cookies first after this match
<GOOD> It won't be like 2 minutes to make
<GOOD> Laggyyyyyy
<GOOD> I just require Peter Griffin Fortnite
<GOOD> Also how hard are the Snake-like skins to get usually
<GOOD> Where they're just in a separate tab
<GOOD> Oh great
<GOOD> I really want Snake
<GOOD> Even if I haven't played Mgs
<GOOD> I forgot I missed Eren
<GOOD> I made my hot chocolate
<GOOD> Also I wanna get to level 20 ASAP for the car glider
<GOOD> It's awesome
<GOOD> FUCK
<GOOD> Like my first actual confrontation in any game and I lose it
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> The exp gain feels pretty slow already
<GOOD> I mean not really but sure
<GOOD> Where is this floating island
<GOOD> I fell to death
<GOOD> Oh immediately picked off by someone I couldn't have seen
<GOOD> That's unfortunate
<GOOD> I found the floating island
<GOOD> It spawns randomly
<GOOD> Also OML I CAME SECOND BECAUSE SOMEHOW I LOST
<GOOD> FFS
<GOOD> I can never win
<GOOD> That sentence makes no sense
<GOOD> Oh I was reading it wrong
<GOOD> Anyway yeah I've literally never won solo
<GOOD> Because I fuckin suck at games
<GOOD> They were in the storm and I still lost
<GOOD> Builds fucking sucks and my opinion on that has never changed
<GOOD> Idk it just doesn't look interesting to me
<GOOD> Like this is even more relevant now but
<GOOD> I just can't be simultaneously good at and interested in anything
<GOOD> Like even if I can be good at something (can't), I can't be interested in things long term
<GOOD> Oh I'm not rlly talking about FN here
<GOOD> I know I suck ass and it annoys me but whatever
<GOOD> I do not enjoy anything for a long time
<GOOD> Frustrated or bored, yes
<GOOD> I mean it happens every few days or even hours
<GOOD> There's only so many things I can do
<GOOD> Like in my flat it's do work (which I do), game (deciding on a game is hard) and put on youtube videos I've watched a billion times
<GOOD> Outside my flat it's like, go shopping
<GOOD> 4 options, 2 of which I don't enjoy doing
<GOOD> Well I don't dislike working
<GOOD> Good question
<GOOD> Uhhhhh don't know
<GOOD> For games it's usually like hey play Rayman that would be neat and then I play Rayman for 20 minutes and stop
<GOOD> Yeah I have a massive library
<GOOD> I feel like MGS rn
<GOOD> But I don't have em installed
<GOOD> Putting pokemon related things in here is like door breaching and flashbanging someone's home
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Btw straight As usually get turned on their head in higher education
<GOOD> Because the work itself is studying usually, and with a combination of workload and requirements it demands a different skillset
<GOOD> What the fuck are these off brand names
<GOOD> I hope I age well
<GOOD> Honestly the richer people seem to age worse
<GOOD> They either become bald or succumb to Scroogeism and there's no inbetwee
<GOOD> Ohhh
<GOOD> I'm talking like author/company rich
<GOOD> Old actors have variety but tbh plastic surgery can make you a different sort of ugly
<GOOD> Too much though can be awful
<GOOD> I'm not smart but consciousness of everything sucks
<GOOD> Yeah but smart people also overthink it seems
<GOOD> Less to think about tho
<GOOD> Like if you aren't smart enough to understand how meaningless shit is you probably aren't embracing pessimistic nihilism
<GOOD> I'm stupid
<GOOD> But in the academic sense so I still have the mindfulness to absolutely hate life
<GOOD> I have to force ignorance so I don't have constant stress that I can't handle
<GOOD> I lack both
<GOOD> I would just choose a giant fucking mech that helps literally no one
<GOOD> Even if I could be the flash I wouldn't if I had to be called Wally West
<GOOD> In the scale of this universe does it matter in the slightest
<GOOD> Why would it
<GOOD> What does this achieve though, do you actually know enough about the stuff you're seeing to tell them
<GOOD> Also just melt people with your laser eyes
<GOOD> Idk just feels like people take people's scaling way out of how much it realistically matters
<GOOD> Comics with powers like that always make me laugh because like how you gonna write an interesting story with a dude that just stops everything before it happens and can't die
<GOOD> But like, what happens
<GOOD> If they're both that fast then what's the purpose of their powers tho
<GOOD> Can't Wally just run faster than that and go back in time before it's eaten and shit
<GOOD> Then what's the point of him being that speedster {ConcernedPoliwhirl}
<GOOD> Like if your speed based character is being outsped then it's not even like, using his powers
<GOOD> Idk it just feels like you have to do a lot of gymnastics to make a challenge
<GOOD> Like oh what if he moved so fast he just put a hole through them
Oh he can't do that because um the dude is faster and he has a Flash-proof shield and speedhax resistant skin
<GOOD> No but if he's faster than the flash and you can't hurt him and also um um he can also travel through time and eats universes and and and
<GOOD> Like do you see the issue
<GOOD> He's just better flash at this point
<GOOD> I can google it
<GOOD> But then how does someone lay the paws on something that big
<GOOD> A giant baseball bat or smth?
<GOOD> That means nothing to me
<GOOD> Like what did he do
<GOOD> I understand what him is but it just isn't explanatory of what he actually did
<GOOD> Like this would suggest Superboy is even faster than the guy who is faster than the flash
<GOOD> I understand what the word means
<GOOD> It's tossed around constantly it's just a nothing phrase
<GOOD> Weakened by what, he's literally just better than them
<GOOD> Ok but like, it's bigger than universes
<GOOD> And faster than the dude who is meant to be the fastest
<GOOD> I mean yeah without that there wouldn't really be a story
<GOOD> LMAO
<GOOD> Hi Vill
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Looks like a job for me
<GOOD> Ughhh writer's block
<GOOD> My head only does that when I fuck up
<GOOD> I can't write rn aaaaaa
<GOOD> Work is hard
<GOOD> Ughhhhh I need to do work
<GOOD> SEPHIROTH!?
<GOOD> Ohio...
<GOOD> My irl friend just told me she loves talking to me
<GOOD> It's Genshin
<GOOD> Pikmin 4 is my GotY
<GOOD> Now and forever (I haven't played it yet)
<GOOD> If Pikmin loses best Strategy game to FE I'm gonna bring some bomb rock yellows and do some mischief
<GOOD> Skibidi word of the year 2024
<GOOD> I wanna cosplay them
<GOOD> I want a silly giant hat like that
<GOOD> Tbh, bigots throw around The Alphabet Mafia and ngl that goes hard as fuck
<GOOD> Where do I sign up
<GOOD> Yes.
<GOOD> can we do a test trade at some point so I can see how this works
<GOOD> Just realised I hadn't even written trade access lmao
<GOOD> *accepted
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> visible
<GOOD> I asked genchat
<GOOD> Is it meant to do that?
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> Also I'm in the ticket
<GOOD> booted out
<GOOD> I thought both of us had to press complete trade rip
<GOOD> Yeah but does this mean scammers can press close immediately
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> The trailer was pretty but like I don't think I get it
<GOOD> GTA fans just got their pikmin 4
<GOOD> Tbf the GTA fans had content to live off
<GOOD> So they aren't insane yet
<GOOD> They can't approach Pikmin our latest content was 2020 and that was just a deluxe edition
<GOOD> We needed Pik 4 to not die
<GOOD> GTA at least got heists and stuff consistently for the entire time
<GOOD> Like they got *things*, if you don't get *things* a community goes insane
<GOOD> Like Batman Arkham
<GOOD> Tell that to the Arkham fans that thought they'd get a new Batman suit a few weeks ago
<GOOD> They went feral and then 1 day later they found out they wouldn't be getting it lmao
<GOOD> Why are people flipping their shit about walmart listing this
<GOOD> Am I missing critical context
<GOOD> Why are people treating this cable like the One Ring
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> MLM cable
<GOOD> Also I assume that this cable then proceeds to kill you?
<GOOD> What if I just don't touch the end and use it to prod people
<GOOD> Can I eat it
<GOOD> Also what happens if I just connect 2 plug sockets together
<GOOD> Infinite power glitch?
<GOOD> Is this like a well known thing?
<GOOD> The plug
<GOOD> The existence of whatever this plug is
<GOOD> I mean of course, because it's fun
<GOOD> I drew 3 funny fellas to develop tomorrow
<GOOD> I took her hat off
<GOOD> No idea what race she is
<GOOD> Like we got a hobgoblin and a kobold
<GOOD> I think the party is missing someone
<GOOD> 3 members is too few
<GOOD> Especially when 1 is less combatant than the rest
<GOOD> What other things does a party of fighters nees
<GOOD> Magic ig
<GOOD> Oh damn I gotta keep on top of my dental
<GOOD> Teeth had a lil blood when I brushed today because I neglected it for a few days
<GOOD> I don't want gingivitis
<GOOD> Aaaa math is hard
<GOOD> I'm doing correlation coefficients
<GOOD> Scrambling my brain even if it's getting easier
<GOOD> I keep getting Yakuza on my Twitter TL
<GOOD> Pretty
<GOOD> Octoling stop, you ink too tough. Your swag too different. Your Grizzco rep is too bad. They'll splat you.
Octoling:
<GOOD> Ughhhhh I can't do audio input for my PC
<GOOD> It makes buzzing noises whenever I do
<GOOD> What is tokusatsu
<GOOD> Oh I love those dudes
<GOOD> I really wanted to try kamen rider tbh
<GOOD> Do we usually expect Nintendo reveals at TGA
<GOOD> I always say sorry
<GOOD> For everything even when I haven't done anything
<GOOD> Asking someone to repeat something is kowtowing?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I'm reading Goodnight Punpun rn and it's making me feel like shit lmao
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> Ruining me
<GOOD> I'm halfway through and it's fantastic
<GOOD> I hope the lego mode is fun so I can grind BP exp
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> If I finish my assignments
<GOOD> So it'll be a few days
<GOOD> Yeah, my PC is being really shit rn
<GOOD> Basically I can only record audio with my headphones, but for whatever reason it's detecting audio through the ear of the headphones and not the mic
<GOOD> So I need to buy a mic
<GOOD> I have no idea how to troubleshoot it
<GOOD> New OC new OC
<GOOD> I gotta think of one
<GOOD> Sloshing Machine since they're meant to represent me
<GOOD> I'm drawing them serving a big corporation instead
<GOOD> Truuuue
<GOOD> What else did you want
<GOOD> Like I'm confused what ppl wanted to see in a trailer at this point
<GOOD> Pokemon fans after a tera raid with legendaries that they asked for, mythical mystery gifts and a free shiny ig
<GOOD> Why would that be in a trailer
<GOOD> Um but what if they read through all the patch notes in the trailer
<GOOD> Like it's a trailer it's not just listing off things you want and that's apparently not clear t
<GOOD> Remember when like 20 seconds of this entire trailer was that
<GOOD> And it's 4 and a half minutes long
<GOOD> So... the people from the game the DLC is for?
<GOOD> How could they
<GOOD> I'm shocked and appalled that they brought back characters from the game
<GOOD> I mean you seem to be complaining that a small part of the trailer was dedicated to a very marketable concept of the DLC that they should very obviously advertise
<GOOD> Literally every time if it takes 20 seconds to convey
<GOOD> Literally just oh hey they're coming back
<GOOD> Then what wouldn't have been
<GOOD> Them telling the story of the DLC before it releases, showing off absolutely everything immediately on top of content they haven't made whilst also saying hey new pokemon and also every other one is returning
<GOOD> There are new pokemon, quests are new stuff what did you want other than that as well as the synchro machine, the room and NPC interactions, Kieran's new design, the Elite 4's theme and team
<GOOD> Then what WOULD excite you if their trailers are showing off what you wanted but oh no not that thing I wanted, something else but also the same thing!!!
<GOOD> Like you wanted new pokemon, you got new pokemon, but the new pokemon aren't the right new pokemon
<GOOD> You wanted new content, the content isn't what you wanted so you're pretending there's none at all
<GOOD> Terapagos, Archaludon, the ones that were advertised to us and compiled in this trailer because believe it or not, they have to market the game as well as reading off a list of things you want
<GOOD> This is a trailer to say hey look at what ID has to offer and in it they show off doubles, every revealed pokemon along with returning ones, multiple new mechanics, and a hint of the storyline
<GOOD> Not really because I know whatever they advertised would have the exact same reaction
<GOOD> If they dropped 50 new mons you'd ask why there weren't 60
<GOOD> So 1 drip fed mon
<GOOD> That you already know is coming
<GOOD> Wow almost like THAT'S LESS THAN 1/12TH OF THE TRAILER
<GOOD> That's how a game works yes
<GOOD> You don't spoil the entire thing before it releases in marketing
<GOOD> Unfortunately they can't have that because revealing the entire game in trailers is bad practice
<GOOD> Wanting to know or do something is the reason you buy a game
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> And it was bad practice and people didn't like it
<GOOD> And also wasn't the focus
<GOOD> This is a catch-all trailer that shows off most of what they can market about the game before it starts just spoiling the plot
<GOOD> Yeah how dare they dedicate 20 seconds to something that will get people talking
<GOOD> Lazy game devs and the actual purpose of a trailer
<GOOD> I'm mostly tired of the constant complaining I hear from everyone after the stuff that's shown isn't EXCLUSIVELY what they wanted to know or see about a game
<GOOD> Like Darkrai distribution? Where is Diancie? Shiny Lucario? Um why not a shiny mythical, stupid devs. Trailer encompassing everything revealed so far and more? They revealed something I didn't want to see marketed
<GOOD> Almost like I'm actually ok with criticism if it's not constant shitting and mockery and negativity for months and years on end
<GOOD> Yeah just like every fucking thing GF has done for the past 5 years or so, with 0 actual point because people act like it has 0 redeemable qualities, and every fucking enjoyable thing about it gets drained by the constant bitching about why the very specific thing people want aren't shown (or sometimes are ig?)
<GOOD> Not really, this is fucking everything
<GOOD> Hey wow I'm excited for {thing} and every time it's a fucking cesspit of people being absolute asshats and pretending that being incredibly negative contrarians is fun
<GOOD> This applies to every single pokemon seemingly
<GOOD> So that is a marketable point
<GOOD> This applies to everything
<GOOD> And hearing oh everything about pokemon ever actually has never had redeeming qualities??? I am very smart is starting to get annoying
<GOOD> I mean the first possible response to the trailer from everyone here was immediately shitting on it or fixating entirely on the parts they didn't like
<GOOD> Oh Lugia is back?
<GOOD> It started in gen 6
<GOOD> That's more of an internal one of constant disappointment from:
>oh hey look something neat, I wonder what people have to say about it!
>go online
<GOOD> Oh I'm absolutely hunting Kubfu if it's possible
<GOOD> Yeah but still, what
<GOOD> That response doesn't make much sense
<GOOD> Ok but like, it's shiny locked and also not relevant to this
<GOOD> Because we're talking about the DLC and not SwSh's DLCs where the featured mons were locked
<GOOD> I wonder how Larry will interact with Iono
<GOOD> I'm gonna spend so much time just like, inviting people over and being like talk
<GOOD> I wonder if it'll be faster to hunt in SwSh or SV
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> I meant for like Lugia and stuff
<GOOD> I need to hunt them still
<GOOD> I love this creature
<GOOD> Why is it .exe'd
<GOOD> I don't know if it's worse if it's neutral to everything, weak to everything offensively and strong defensively or the other way around
<GOOD> Because worst case scenario we have terapagos walling absolutely everything with a 19th type tera and being unable to do damage but being a fucking monster
<GOOD> Can I take a hiatus from my hiatus
<GOOD> Was that ball always on top of thr Zero Gate
<GOOD> I wonder if it's relevant or not
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> The creature
<GOOD> He looks like a pitbull
<GOOD> Analog horror fans when I show them a face of a person smiling with bloodshot eyes in greyscale
<GOOD> I'm so excited
<GOOD> Idk which one to buy
<GOOD> Frieza has 3 forms but Cell is awesome
<GOOD> Where's Frieza's other forms
<GOOD> Also yeah I do wish that Cell's 2nd form was there but it wouldn't fit the skeleton
<GOOD> Also THE POD IS A BACK BLING AND NOT A GLIDER I'M DONE
<GOOD> It's this but like, no one likes it
<GOOD> Well it's ok here but like usually it looks gross
<GOOD> Cell Max also looks mostly similar to this form
<GOOD> But better
<GOOD> Sounds good to me
<GOOD> I tried
<GOOD> I need it
<GOOD> I think imma buy the Cell bundle even though you get less shit
<GOOD> Unless there's an emote I haven't seen
<GOOD> I want the cell egg hammer
<GOOD> I need it
<GOOD> I'm buying Cell absolutely
<GOOD> I really want Frieza because of more stuff but like first form cell is so gross I love it
<GOOD> When does TGA happen btw
<GOOD> And the reveals and stuff
<GOOD> Dude I'm obsessed with dentman rn
<GOOD> He's so cool
<GOOD> Did anything interesting happen
<GOOD> Is Matan that dude
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> That's funny
<GOOD> Raaaaagh
<GOOD> I really wanted to play BG3 but my PC definitely can't run it for a few years lmao
<GOOD> Intel core i3 8350k CPU
8gb DDR4 RAM
256GB nvme OS drive 
512GB SSD
AMD Radeon rx6400 4gb GPU
750w platinum PSU
<GOOD> I'm saving for 16 gig but like, it can't run most things afaik lol
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is it just a software I download or is it hardware
<GOOD> Nvm found it
<GOOD> Is there a list of supported ones?
<GOOD> Also by baked in that means BG3 has it on download?
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Can't play it for like 7 years until I get a PC to run it mmmm
<GOOD> Making up fake energy is hard
<GOOD> What did paradox develop again
<GOOD> Didn't CS2 have like a really shitty release
<GOOD> I doubt you can call rigged on that then lmao
<GOOD> So what does that change about the game in this category
<GOOD> Ok ig
<GOOD> For best strategy it was, I just scrubbed out that part in the SS because it's funny
<GOOD> At least I think CS2 was nominated
<GOOD> It was like FE, Pimin, CS2 and Advance Wars
<GOOD> If CK3 is a strategy game I have bad news
<GOOD> BG3
<GOOD> And we fuckin balling with it
<GOOD> Pikmin 4 clears Spiderman 2 raaaa
<GOOD> CK3 doesn't have dandori, mid game I fear
<GOOD> Pikmin has a loving family and murder
<GOOD> I mean it was because it was in a relatively uncontested categort
<GOOD> But then again Pikmin is all about being a masterpiece in its niche
<GOOD> Very few games even attempt to muscle in on... whatever Pikmin has going on
<GOOD> Because the second it was made it just kinda carved a cool niche and stayed there
<GOOD> Specifically an RTS in which you are physically present
<GOOD> This isn't like Civ where you just get a number and click a button to invade
<GOOD> You're boots on the ground controlling this small army and every death feels painful
<GOOD> Yeah but seeing like 20 of your singing little guys get smooshed because you fucked up hurts
<GOOD> Yeah but you aren't like an omnipotent god or a commander here
<GOOD> Olimar is just a family man
<GOOD> He works for a delivery company
<GOOD> Oatchi is a dog
<GOOD> Yeah but that oh well feeling isn't felt in Pikmin
<GOOD> Like it's not oh no strong enemy, my army is gonna get smaller, it's NOOOOOOOOOOO as you watch the water wraith kill the dudes because of your negligence
<GOOD> Or panic because a bunch of them fell into water
<GOOD> It makes chaos a lot more chaotic
<GOOD> They sometimes won't save themselves
<GOOD> Also there's stuff like bomb rocks, poison etc
<GOOD> Anything like that hitting a lot of pikmin can be scary, just look at titan dweevil
<GOOD> Or lightning arcing through your pikmin and frying them in a few seconds
<GOOD> This isn't about the difficulty
<GOOD> It's about the experience
<GOOD> When things go *wrong*, it spirals
<GOOD> It's not oh click here to make your army retreat, it's Fuck I gotta whistle like 40 screaming soldiers while they burn to death but oh fuck there's bomb dweevils and bumbling snitchbugs and OH SHIT
<GOOD> There's a lot more of a human aspect to the game
<GOOD> Even then, you don't do that in other RTS games
<GOOD> That's still a fight
<GOOD> It's your first playthrough of a game, you won't know everything and stuff like Water Wraith can genuinely be suprising
<GOOD> Not really the game's fault I imagine
<GOOD> The Nintendo game for children is not incredibly difficult yes
<GOOD> OMFG SAME
<GOOD> IDK HOW TO FIX IT
<GOOD> Eh the UI is alr, this bug just sucks ass
<GOOD> I really wanna play Guilty Gear Strivw
<GOOD> Unironically just brushed my teeth because Dentman told me to
<GOOD> I love the dude sm
<GOOD> Genuinely makes me smile more than most things to see how excited other people also are about him
<GOOD> I don't like gyms
<GOOD> I only eat smoky bacon crisps lmao
<GOOD> But agreed
<GOOD> which of these hairs do you think looks better
<GOOD> If I take off some of the glow on the right ofc
<GOOD> Oh also I have no idea how to make anything else not a flat colour lmao
<GOOD> Keeping this for now
<GOOD> With obligatory Christmas filter
<GOOD> I polished it up
<GOOD> Probably the best digital drawing I've done tbh
<GOOD> I'm v happy with it
<GOOD> Idk their name tho
<GOOD> I can absolutely answer this one they play Ghoti
<GOOD> 0
<GOOD> Idk they're me so either purple, teal, their hair colour or maroon
<GOOD> Maybe from salmonids lmao
<GOOD> I wanted to play Suships ngl
<GOOD> I just didn't understand them
<GOOD> That's a fantastic concept
<GOOD> My favorite burn deck is trains
<GOOD> Idk if that even counts
<GOOD> But rail cannon my beloved
<GOOD> Idk I played Dinos and Toons when I stopped playing lol
<GOOD> And Krawlers irl because I like pissing off my friends and also nervous systems
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> I just submitted my final piece of work for the semester
<GOOD> Playing Lego Fortnite rn
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> The mode is fun
<GOOD> I also have a compatible skin (green goblin) so I'm happy
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Also do campfires not give heat?
<GOOD> You're meant to have Cuddle Team Leader spawn yes
<GOOD> Or random idk
<GOOD> Also it seems like only shelter gives me heat lmao
<GOOD> I'm standing on campfires and they don't give off heat
<GOOD> Also yay free BP levels
<GOOD> Every day I inch closer to Peter Griff
<GOOD> Yeah I had that w the free rocket league car lmao
<GOOD> Like, 11 lmao
<GOOD> It's only the first week
<GOOD> And I haven't done the 3 lego quests and my final weekly etc
<GOOD> No rush tbf, I have 2 months
<GOOD> Is there a specific thing that does it
<GOOD> The lego quests give free levels but idk
<GOOD> Gives exp
<GOOD> Frieza Fortnite will be real soon
<GOOD> (I will be buying Cell)
<GOOD> Bro the what
<GOOD> At this rate Fortnite will be the only fucking game lmao
<GOOD> They're monopolising
<GOOD> And yk, the battle royale
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> The rainbow vomit is sending me
<GOOD> I thought they drew a teardrop on the doctor for a secons
<GOOD> Idk never watched it
<GOOD> Is annoying orange also trans
<GOOD> I think my favourite fandub joke is the one where they set up a really long explanation knowing the dialogue gets cut off about 5 seconds later
<GOOD> Either that or just Eggman's VA in 06 responding to Elise with like 5 seconds of unbroken silence
<GOOD> Over halfway done with Punpun
<GOOD> It's still fantastic but god I hate him rn
<GOOD> I might save up to upgrade my RAM and buy BG3
<GOOD> 8GB lmao
<GOOD> I've been meaning to upgrade it but I haven't treated myself in a while
<GOOD> I'll copy paste my specs again Because I have no idea
<GOOD> Intel core i3 8350k CPU
8gb DDR4 RAM
256GB nvme OS drive 
512GB SSD
AMD Radeon rx6400 4gb GPU
750w platinum PSU
<GOOD> Unsure if there's any other specs you need
<GOOD> Not sure
<GOOD> I know nothing about PCs
<GOOD> Motherboard first?
<GOOD> I didn't know it had a big effect on performance
<GOOD> Also I'm ngl I have no idea how to dismantle this PC
<GOOD> Did I even say what my motherboard was I forgor
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure it says Z270 MS on it but I have no idea what that means
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Then yeah idk how to identify my motherboard
<GOOD> Oh it's M5
<GOOD> It looks like 2 RAM slots
<GOOD> Oh one sec lemme check
<GOOD> Nvm yep 4 slots
<GOOD> Narrower than I thought
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> This was just how it came
<GOOD> CPU port priority real
<GOOD> How far am I from recommended
<GOOD> Also does minimum mean bare minimum for the game running smoothly or minimum for the game to run at all
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Hopefully mine runs smooth on Low, I'll test w the demo at some point
<GOOD> Why, can't I just use the demo as a test
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ig I'll just wait a while then
<GOOD> But yeah I might invest in a larger SSD and another 8GB, then consider a motherboard after
<GOOD> I need to clean up my storage actually
<GOOD> It's just hard to organise
<GOOD> Can I borrow someone here for a FN exp glitch later if it isn't patched
<GOOD> Like, 4 hrs
<GOOD> >enter local gaming tournament
>kung fu mystery category
>it's Rayman football and I lose
<GOOD> In 4 hours btw
<GOOD> No idea how long it would take because reeheehee free exp
<GOOD> They should patch that up
<GOOD> I must finish eating so I can fortnite exp
<GOOD> Peter Griffin jumpscare
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Bird is the word goes hard as fuck
<GOOD> Either way fortnite exp raaaa

<GOOD> Maaaan my switch crashed
<GOOD> I only got to lv 60
<GOOD> Exp glitch yeah
<GOOD> It's not hard but now my switch crashed I can't do it till tomorrow
<GOOD> Do you have an alt or an idle friend
<GOOD> Also have you done the daily jam session quest
<GOOD> It's fun
<GOOD> In a sec
<GOOD> Also I don't play on Switcg
<GOOD> I'll have to add you over Epic
<GOOD> I'm talking about the game in general
<GOOD> >or an idle friend
<GOOD> Make them the leader of a party, go to Jam Session, both of you get up on the stage and jam for 20 minutes, then when the quest for doing 20 minutes is up, the friend goes COMPLETELY idle, and you leave and rejoin over and over
<GOOD> The friend has to continue jamming
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Also mmmmgf 10 more levels until Peter Griff
<GOOD> I only have a Switch alt and it crashes
<GOOD> Plus idk if it works if I've done the quest today which I have
<GOOD> I gotta do all the other quests that give levels now
<GOOD> I am doing lego fortnite
<GOOD> I only have 2 left
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> But I only have the cave one left
<GOOD> And the village level 4
<GOOD> So idk how to exploit that
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Enter a cave in survival
<GOOD> I mean do you have a world with a cave
<GOOD> I'm willing to try it
<GOOD> Alr sure
<GOOD> Am I gonna be leaving and joining or are you
<GOOD> Yeah but only 1 can get exp
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Alr so do we do cave thing
<GOOD> Ok now lemme try
<GOOD> YEAAAAAAHHHHH BABY
<GOOD> As long as ur in the world it should continue to
<GOOD> Session has expired?
<GOOD> did you leave?
<GOOD> What is happening
<GOOD> It just keeps saying it's expired
<GOOD> Uh idk
<GOOD> I just can't join back
<GOOD> Can you go back to the cave rq to check
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Glitch won't work now I don't think
<GOOD> Lemme try tho
<GOOD> Rejoining the workd
<GOOD> No idea if it wikl
<GOOD> I only have village lvl 4 now
<GOOD> Let me check but I doubt it
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Welp
<GOOD> Yeah I was checking
<GOOD> Yeah but it can't be a lvl 4 one
<GOOD> That's super expensive
<GOOD> Are you sure?
<GOOD> Also where can I build
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> If you want
<GOOD> Was waiting to see if you wanted to
<GOOD> You may need to stay in the general area if I get the quest tho
<GOOD> I have no idea how it works
<GOOD> Yeah but like you have stuff to do
<GOOD> And that's just an inconvenience
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> This is funny
<GOOD> Uhh
<GOOD> It got worse
<GOOD> got to lv 4
<GOOD> Just need granite and planks now
<GOOD> Then it can begin
<GOOD> I'll wait till you come back
<GOOD> Yeah bc I need to upgrade it
<GOOD> Then leave
<GOOD> Now let's test
<GOOD> Time to continue
<GOOD> Raaaagh tysm Vill
<GOOD> 1 level until Peter Griff
<GOOD> I will continue as long as Vill permits
<GOOD> 8
<GOOD> For the battle pass
<GOOD> It refunds itself if you complete it though
<GOOD> There are a few you can just get
<GOOD> I forget which tho
<GOOD> There's one rn that has a few quests tied to it iirc
<GOOD> Nah that free pack in the shop too
<GOOD> I forgot what it was
<GOOD> It was 0 and it gave me a few quests
<GOOD> And the reward is a skin
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Someone gifted me Among Us Backbling and the BTS emotes once
<GOOD> I think you can only gift them on purchase
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yeah you can gift the battle pass for 950
<GOOD> Almost level 80
<GOOD> I'll do that tomorrow bc rn I'm doing the glitch thing
<GOOD> And it's volatile af it seems
<GOOD> Oh real?
<GOOD> I might make one later then
<GOOD> Also I haven't found them
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> For now I will power up
<GOOD> And reach my final form
<GOOD> No idea what level is what
<GOOD> So I'm just continuing as far as I can
<GOOD> Isn't 200 the max or smth, idk I'm only fixated on bird is the word and top hat Peter
<GOOD> Oh yeah that lmao
<GOOD> I wanna try the FNAF maps lmao
<GOOD> They seem funny
<GOOD> Yrah
<GOOD> It really sucks
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> I think there's occasional crashing too
<GOOD> But not a huge amount
<GOOD> Why won't Discord open on my PC lmao
<GOOD> Tf
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> I'm doing it constantly lol
<GOOD> Almost at 90
<GOOD> I have Fortnite in a window while I watch YT
<GOOD> Rubber band frfr
<GOOD> Perfect
<GOOD> You can get decently cheap ones sometimes
<GOOD> Almost tier 100
<GOOD> And this is to go... EVEN FURTHER BEYOND
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Almost at 110
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I think they moved some to the extra track tho
<GOOD> So you gotta grind ~~or cheat~~
<GOOD> Almost at 120
<GOOD> 50 levels since we started
<GOOD> I'm going as long as Vill permits which I doubt is that long lmao
<GOOD> It would be like another hour at least
<GOOD> I'm happy with stopping any time but I'm being greedy
<GOOD> I'm mostly gunning for Top Hat Peter now
<GOOD> What does the current content let you get to
<GOOD> Like there are some locked pages
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I am at lv 120.
<GOOD> GIVE IT UP FOR HOUR 4
<GOOD> I hear Epic doesn't really punish shit like this so here's hoping
<GOOD> That's what I thought
<GOOD> Yeah this is just their mistake lol
<GOOD> I can do it tomorrow if it isn't patched
<GOOD> Because then my jam quest will be reset
<GOOD> I don't think it would work w the creative sandbox one
<GOOD> Oh,  I think it stopped doing it
<GOOD> 121
<GOOD> That's p good
<GOOD> I don't think it'll work w the creative sandbox bc you have to make it
<GOOD> We can try it if you want
<GOOD> I have to host tho
<GOOD> Lemme claim stuff rq
<GOOD> I am 5 tiers away from Peter's other styles which is hype
<GOOD> Yes, and I will idle
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Oh actually
<GOOD> Vill you just have to see the quest complete
<GOOD> Oh here we go
<GOOD> Ready when you are Vill
<GOOD> Follow me
<GOOD> Wait wha
<GOOD> I think it crashed one sec
<GOOD> I need to restart
<GOOD> Basically just follow me to the stage
<GOOD> Then we jam on it
<GOOD> You gotta quit out
<GOOD> I'm not here rn
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Then idk
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> It's 9pm rn
<GOOD> I recommend we do it now bc I sleep around midnight
<GOOD> You'll get a good few hours of grinding in
<GOOD> You sure?
<GOOD> Okie then
<GOOD> Apparently
<GOOD> Does Peter Griffin look better on car glider, shenron or Goblin Glider
<GOOD> Can't unlock it for a while rip
<GOOD> It's locked behind quests that come later
<GOOD> At least I have Butt Scratcher pickaxe
<GOOD> WOAAAAAAAHHHHHH
<GOOD> Woooaaaaaahhhh, woooaahh, story of Undertale
<GOOD> Vill
<GOOD> I like Fortnite festival
<GOOD> RAAAAAAAAAAGH THANK YOU MEOW SKULLS
<GOOD> He is truly majestic
<GOOD> Mine stopped at 121
<GOOD> I will have to grind more fortnite festival then
<GOOD> Keyboard is working well for me
<GOOD> I have an issue
<GOOD> I can literally only play vocals on Bad Romance and literally no other songs or instruments help
<GOOD> Same but unfortunately incapable of that so boo womp
<GOOD> If my body did not throw a tantrum and freeze up when it's sad that would be cool I think
<GOOD> Also RIP E3
<GOOD> Should have been game awards anyway
<GOOD> Award shows suck ass
<GOOD> Same it has Peter Griffin
<GOOD> That always makes me laugh when ppl say this, like
<GOOD> It's very obvious who It's for
<GOOD> I'm not acting like that, I'm saying that going who is this movie FOR? Can often be easily answered with small children and people that will watch it because they liked the other ones
<GOOD> Yeah the first movie created a bit of an uproar
<GOOD> Not saying this is a good thing, it's just a very clear answer
<GOOD> That's what I said ye
<GOOD> I'm watching Scott Pilgrim movie for the first time
<GOOD> Yeah but they're in the spirit realm which was an established thing in 3
<GOOD> The bull guy came back from the spirit realm so presumably the others can
<GOOD> Idk I didn't watch the show
<GOOD> Idk this dude is like green
<GOOD> And he has 2 glaives on chains
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> My friend liked her gift and gave me a hug and then listened to me rant about rubberhose cartoons and One Piece for like an hour
<GOOD> She's too good for me
<GOOD> Oh also this new random ass Ryan Reynolds movie actually created a non-uncanny live action cartoon
<GOOD> And I love them
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> I feel like saying japanese game is a bit of a wide net there
<GOOD> Fortnite waterboarding
<GOOD> My flatmates have designated me unanimously as both their favourite flatmate and the mascot of the flat despite me literally never doing anything
<GOOD> They said that if any of the flat members picked beef with me the rest would deck them so like
<GOOD> That's good to know
<GOOD> Defense form W
<GOOD> Oh my god Chrono Trigger is so good already
<GOOD> The courtroom scene made me love it
<GOOD> I was talking to my friend and apparently I did literally everything wrong in the courtroom
<GOOD> I like Frog rn
<GOOD> I haven't met Robo
<GOOD> Do I have to do a playthrough for every ending?
<GOOD> Also how many
<GOOD> I did spoil but oh my god that's such an amazing idea wtf
<GOOD> How long would the max ending take, about 25 hrs?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I overestimated lol
<GOOD> O damn
<GOOD> I love how the spacing system works
<GOOD> It's so dynamic
<GOOD> I'm playing the Steam remaster thing btw
<GOOD> So the active combat is rlly stressful but fun
<GOOD> ~~the first boss was somehow close it was embarrassing~~
<GOOD> I've only ever seen Chrono Trigger comapared to DQ because Toriyama, and then people call it the best RPG ever made
<GOOD> So like, that's exciting
<GOOD> What's the best RPG you've played?
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> Is Xenogears related to Xenoblade in any way or is it just a name coincidence
<GOOD> Yeah Square is the big boy of JRPGs
<GOOD> Ah ok
<GOOD> Is it similar or is it a more traditional RPG
<GOOD> Ah ok
<GOOD> Probably good for me, I didn't see the appeal of XBC but I'll put Gears on the list
<GOOD> Is ATB active turn basedM
<GOOD> Wait, that's a genre of RPG?
<GOOD> I thought this was just a Chrono Trigger mechanic
<GOOD> Yeah I've tried FF7 Remaster, FF14 (for like half an hour), FF15 and that's about it
<GOOD> I didn't get too far in any of them
<GOOD> I vaguely remember that
<GOOD> The spacing based gameplay is already getting underwhelming
<GOOD> *overwhelming
<GOOD> But it's fun
<GOOD> Idk how I mixed those up
<GOOD> I'm very prone to panicking when the meter fills
<GOOD> I keep using fire spin and that keeps working though so
<GOOD> Because MP
<GOOD> Yeah I've been nuking groups w it
<GOOD> Then I killed the boss w Flamethrower and X slash
<GOOD> Is that Frog and uhhh
<GOOD> The mechanic girl
<GOOD> I haven't used it but it's like X-slurp or whatever
<GOOD> Oh since it was a 10 gift card and Chrono Trigger was 6 I also bought base Vampire Survivors
<GOOD> Because my friend said it was good
<GOOD> Is Chrono Cross related to Trigger
<GOOD> Or is Trigger a 1 and done game
<GOOD> Most people know me as Inigo Montoya
<GOOD> Goku why did you sing this
<GOOD> I really wanna buy this song since I have 1500 vbucks lmao
<GOOD> Chrono Trigger is so cool
<GOOD> Oh my god yes I hate that
<GOOD> Also I just got Robo
<GOOD> He's cool
<GOOD> I am so lost rn
<GOOD> I figured it out
<GOOD> Ok enough Chrono Trigger rn
<GOOD> I'm like lv 16 now
<GOOD> And I did the dinosaur area but all I got was armour and a third eye
<GOOD> My game lags when people are near
<GOOD> It's like prophetic visions that I can't do anything about
<GOOD> Pikmin 18 billion and 11 leak
<GOOD> Also this reminds me I'm getting 3 DX and 4 for Christmas
<GOOD> Summoning Salt is bad for my heart man this documentary is awesome
<GOOD> The SM speedrunning community when Shivering King Banana comes into the speedrunning scene
<GOOD> This reminds me I haven't watched the jimmypoopins video yst
<GOOD> Yet
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Eepy
<GOOD> Almost done with Nichijou
<GOOD> It keeps making me smile and laugh
<GOOD> Yeah I needed it after finishing Punpun yesterday
<GOOD> Absolutely crushed me mentally
<GOOD> Eh it felt refreshing aftsr
<GOOD> It was just a new feeling for me because of how unique the feeling is
<GOOD> Having relatability to a character turned on its head was really upsetting
<GOOD> I thought you could local play for them
<GOOD> So it's not locked
<GOOD> Why did you jump to a second switch immediately instead of having a friend
<GOOD> Mean when THIS FRANCHISE CAN HAVE SELF CONTAINED ENTRIES BECAUSE IT'S FOR CHILDREN THAT DON'T GET THOSE GAMES
<GOOD> Already was in ORAS, it's in every fame
<GOOD> Game
<GOOD> Like, why SV getting flak for something that has been the standard for over 7 years
<GOOD> Is it that suprising
<GOOD> It's the exact same as the last 9 years
<GOOD> So like eventually you just have to be like ok it exists
<GOOD> That is catching pokemon in general
<GOOD> Like, the legendaries existing and not existing in the game makes 0 diff
<GOOD> So why not ig, don't really care if they're shovelled in
<GOOD> I mean if you're talking comp then having them accessible every game is great because it allows potential pruning of mons that have issues
<GOOD> While allowing you to catch most legendaries usable in the game in 1 entry
<GOOD> Eh, market it or not it's still inconsequential
<GOOD> The dev time of what
<GOOD> Like that's just a nonsensical jab for no reason
<GOOD> It takes 5 seconds to import the legendaries
<GOOD> However their new models look neat
<GOOD> Yay a separate issue
<GOOD> That is completely irrelevant to what you were talking about
<GOOD> Like Gamefreak is lazy, and adding legendaries is a lazy and easy way to market, which means it doesn't take away dev time from anything
<GOOD> It's just goalpost moving
<GOOD> And ORAS
<GOOD> As I said, the standard for almost 10 years
<GOOD> It's not gonna change and there's nothing inherently harmful in doing it
<GOOD> Better than them being wholly inaccessible
<GOOD> Remember the Enamorous issue and then they made the genies accessible in this game
<GOOD> It's a larger term but the issue of needing other games to obtain pokemon to use in this one in comp
<GOOD> Meaning that a lot of viable mons required ownership of a different game if you didn't want the risk of genned mons getting you DQ'd
<GOOD> Yes Eiscue is very comparable to Urshifu Rapid
<GOOD> Something that previously required 2 games and DLC for one to obtain in SV is now just the DLC for the game
<GOOD> Also they haven't fixed it because it's free money
<GOOD> I mean no, they don't do that
<GOOD> They just verify it with their shitty checks
<GOOD> Why tho
<GOOD> Does it detract from the experience to have more legendaries
<GOOD> Is it actively harmful to include these legendaries
<GOOD> Why does it bother you that they are present and why is it an issue
<GOOD> It's a lazy band aid fix to having them in the game but like, what does it actually do
<GOOD> It makes them accessible
<GOOD> But they already are
<GOOD> Heatran was in Unova for no reason, the Regis were in Unova for no reason
<GOOD> The Latis were in the Dreamyard because uhhhh
<GOOD> The Regis were in Hoenn and Sinnoh because uhhh
<GOOD> If you're arguing lore, then the regis have no place there
<GOOD> As they are in Hoenn
<GOOD> And Galar
<GOOD> And Unova
<GOOD> Like, don't act like it wasn't already a thing for Pokemon to be inconsistent
<GOOD> This wasn't my point
<GOOD> Someone else made this point
<GOOD> There was already never a why
<GOOD> In HGSS you play music to summon pokemon out of nowhere
<GOOD> That's a convenience thing
<GOOD> Convenience takes precedence over lore accuracy in pokemon and that has been clear since the start
<GOOD> And a lot don't
<GOOD> And it doesn't hurt the people that already have them to give them to people who don't
<GOOD> Like how dare other people get Articuno and I get a 2nd one
<GOOD> Sir a STAB blizzard has hit gen 1 OU
<GOOD> Then don't catch one lol
<GOOD> I mean no this isn't applicable, it's the equivalent of me saying everyone should get more money and you saying nah I already have money, no one should get more
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Reminder that SV is a first pokemon game for many children
<GOOD> Like my family could barely get me Black 2 as a kid there's no way I would have asked them for HGSS too because I wanted the legendary dogs
<GOOD> + the other option would be to give the games the gen 3/4 structure where you can ONLY get some specific mons from owning 3-4 games or more
<GOOD> >gen 3/4
>apparently 1 gen
<GOOD> In gen 4 you require some gen 3 games for specific mons
<GOOD> In gen 3 you required an entirely different console for some mons
<GOOD> And more than 1 game
<GOOD> Like say what you want about returning legendaries but it's not oh you want Lugia in Ruby? Enjoy buying a gamecube, link cable, and XD
<GOOD> Forgetting that things cost money ig
<GOOD> Like why are you complaining about getting the content locked away? It means if you want it you get to buy a really fun game and a console and accessory!!!
<GOOD> Dude
<GOOD> I genuinely don't understand what point you're making
<GOOD> Lugia in XD only is good because instead of like 25 legendaries in a 30 purchase, you get to pay upwards of 150 for something you might use later?
<GOOD> If you wanted Ho Oh you needed to 100% Colo
<GOOD> 2nd game for the 2nd console
<GOOD> 1 gamecube is more than 1 pokemon DLC
<GOOD> And 1 gamecube and 1 game for 1 legendary vs 1 dlc for 25
<GOOD> I still don't understand the point you're trying to make
<GOOD> Before Emerald basically all the gen 2 mons were Colo/XD only and this partially continued after which sucks sm
<GOOD> They also had the DP thing where if you wanted some mons you had to own the GBA games as well
<GOOD> Also Slowpoke being Leafgreen exclusive across every gen 3 entry and no other mon doing so is funny af
<GOOD> To Leafgreen yes
<GOOD> And if you didn't have LG you couldn't catch it in literally any other game
<GOOD> Afaik at least
<GOOD> Gamefreak used to have soul mfs when they paygate gen 2 mons behind owning multiple games and systems
<GOOD> Like 20 years ago
<GOOD> Only 5 games and 2 systems and a link cable
<GOOD> Replays because the first playthrough isn't a replay I assume
<GOOD> Oh also don't even start on the mythicals in gen 3
<GOOD> At least later gens had wifi events
<GOOD> To get Celebi in the modern day you need a Japanese Colosseum and the Bonus disk
<GOOD> And if you want Jirachi you either need a whole different game or Colo bonus
<GOOD> And if you want Deoxys you need to do manipulation of the game's code by corrupting your save because um uh
<GOOD> So glad that ORAS made all the legendaries accessible right
<GOOD> Ehhh I prefer 2 games to like 7 to get all legendaries
<GOOD> Not half but they had a weird system where you needed a member of a trio from the other game to get the 3rd one
<GOOD> Like I think you needed Zekrom and Reshiram or smth for Kyurem
<GOOD> I forget
<GOOD> Gen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
<GOOD> I'm so glad I won't have to deal with Yveltal and Xerneas in SV for a while
<GOOD> So did SwSh
<GOOD> The DAs are version exclusive
<GOOD> Yes but that's in the same way as just trade for them
<GOOD> If you don't have friends/online you can't get those raids
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> It's a standard as I said, nothing really wrong w having it
<GOOD> It's lazy and fast to implement
<GOOD> I'm just glad to see the updated models
<GOOD> New Ho Oh looks awesome
<GOOD> It's not just textures
<GOOD> Took a sec to compile what I had
<GOOD> Ho oh is the most noticeable but they polished most of them
<GOOD> Also these
<GOOD> Lunala's starry texture looks cool in SV too
<GOOD> Yeah like, the texture/pattern on Lunala
<GOOD> The stars
<GOOD> Oh shit misremembered the stars, it was only on the head
<GOOD> The wings still look so much better
<GOOD> They made it more muted
<GOOD> Ugh I can't find good images because it's only been out a few days
<GOOD> I need more images of Terapagos to make a pfp
<GOOD> Spoiler policy still exists for things we didn't already know before it released
<GOOD> Oh also I think the birbs have slightly altered models
<GOOD> Though I don't remember
<GOOD> Entei got a fairly big change as well
<GOOD> Like, a bit more than Suicune
<GOOD> No, Suicune also has slight model changes
<GOOD> It's more slender and the face is changed
<GOOD> Depends, a lot of the models are small changes that lead to them looking way better overall
<GOOD> They all look way more like their illustrations now
<GOOD> That's moreso texture than models but that helps yeah
<GOOD> Found em
<GOOD> Entei is the most changed of the beast trio
<GOOD> And the crest is metallic
<GOOD> And it's wider
<GOOD> I mean they all do
<GOOD> They were updated to look sharper and more accurate to their anime/original designs
<GOOD> Because some didn't need much
<GOOD> Fuck I'm so excited
<GOOD> I really hope this ends up being funded so much it just adapts all of OP
<GOOD> Luffy vs Rob Lucci reanimated by fucking Wit Studios would go hard as fuck
<GOOD> Drip
<GOOD> Eh, I had a problem in the sense I was like oh I don't like this song then never talked about it again
<GOOD> I didn't say that tho
<GOOD> Problem  having a problem with something
<GOOD> I doubt he's coming back for that response
<GOOD> He was meant to today and then 24 pages of evidence dropped
<GOOD> So like
<GOOD> Even if he was planning to that mf can't say anything anymore
<GOOD> Didn't say the song was bad or annoying, I just don't like the song or sometimes Jocat
<GOOD> And I left it alone and then today I was like oh that sucks they got bullied
<GOOD> Wasn't her post just I made this
<GOOD> >AMAB
>play Super Meat Boy
>become enby
>play Celeste
<GOOD> Good conversations in this server
<GOOD> Excusez moi, I am v scary
<GOOD> Yeah definitely I'm gonna uhhh scare you or smth
<GOOD> I think it's made by LG
<GOOD> Shieldon
<GOOD> Even tagged spoilers, yes
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> It's a weird line
<GOOD> You can talk about officially shown mons and some updates to things like movesets
<GOOD> But it's hard to determine
<GOOD> Boo
<GOOD> Also there is no way he put this in a monetised video about these allegations
<GOOD> It's animated like game theory
<GOOD> Grok is so fucking funny
<GOOD> And community notes
<GOOD> Because like Elon is denying they work correctly when they're correct
<GOOD> I want it
<GOOD> I wanna be someone's Kazooie to their Banjo frfr
<GOOD> 5 days
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> I'm a lilllll drunk
<GOOD> Cider yummyyy
<GOOD> Might not mod much today
<GOOD> Also  my mom forgot the 1 gift I asked for rip
<GOOD> Damn Mitten Squad died :((
<GOOD> Dude is this the fucking worst day of the year or what
<GOOD> It's chaos out there
<GOOD> Well not worst but strangest
<GOOD> Dream shit, FNF shit, FNAF Roblox game, Banban 6, that Blizzard dude
<GOOD> It's like a fucking blender of the weirdest bingo draws ever
<GOOD> Willow
<GOOD> You have summoned the jolly one
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> This is the lamest attack name I've seen lmao
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Watching Better Call Saul
<GOOD> It is quite good
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Ok so
<GOOD> Apparently the Roblox FNAF game was released by accident
<GOOD> The company heard this skin is good from Scott, and then turned that into release the game
<GOOD> I mean Scott has a reputation for hiring awfully incompetent people usually lmao
<GOOD> How hard is it to dismantle a PC and build it again
<GOOD> I may wanna use Christmas money to upgrade my shit which may require dismantling everything
<GOOD> I wish I could properly upgrade but I'm rlly stingy
<GOOD> I just haven't spent my loan money on anything except food yet
<GOOD> Oh and a deposit for next year's accommodation
<GOOD> I wanna treat myself mannnn
<GOOD> I just don't have the money
<GOOD> Oh my fucking god people are defending the Rockstar hacker
<GOOD> No they're saying it's unethical to put someone in indefinite hospital and trying to say he's being imprisoned for being autistic
<GOOD> Fuck out of here with that
<GOOD> Am I going crazy
<GOOD> Or are people genuinely calling hacking the Ministry of Health in Brazil among dozens of others excusable because they're 18 and autistic
<GOOD> And being in the majority because hurr durr dismantle society
<GOOD> They're also twisting it as a life of torture for leaking GTA 6
<GOOD> Like dude it's a fucking hospital and they're there because they hacked something while on probation for hacking things
<GOOD> Oh but ofc Insomniac getting hacked is also horrible (it is but yahoo double standards)
<GOOD> Oooo new splatfest
<GOOD> Scott is so bad at hiring people istg
<GOOD> Hired that shit person with ass art to draw the comic versions of his books, hired Steel Wool for SB despite them obviously being far better suited for VR, and now this
<GOOD> Like I can barely even blame Steel Wool for Security Breach because like, HW1 and 2 are both awesome
<GOOD> But Scott was like yeh massive scale 3D non-VR project
<GOOD> I mean it led to a better end product
<GOOD> I couldn't play HW1 because I only had the PS4 controller for motion track
<GOOD> The dualshock only has light on the front so if you turn at all it freaks out
<GOOD> Also it means you have 1 hand and the sensor bar on the front is also just kinda inconsistent
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> But it's awful
<GOOD> I don't know if it released when I bought it for VR
<GOOD> My brother is getting an Oculus quest 2 for Crimis
<GOOD> Idk what he's gonna buy tbh
<GOOD> Hell, idek what I'm gonna buy myself for Christmas
<GOOD> I might try Sam and Max at some point
<GOOD> But rn I'm probably gonna buy Metroid Prime remastered and whatever Pikmin games I don't get
<GOOD> Dota
<GOOD> This is a funny image
<GOOD> Tbf I've seen Smite skins cost over 1000
<GOOD> In the sense that you had to donate 1000 to a charity stream to get it
<GOOD> Worth it for Poolseidon...
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> It was like a beta only skin so they made it a charity goal thing
<GOOD> I mean since that stream you've never been able to get it again
<GOOD> But nah it's just you want it? A shitton of money
<GOOD> You got a choice between 2 skins with Poolseidon being the worse one in the sense it doesn't have revamped animations
<GOOD> We all know the real best of the 2 tho
<GOOD> Absolutely
<GOOD> Oop-
<GOOD> Tbf I probably do have disposable money I just constantly act like I have to survive lmao
<GOOD> Tbf it's only like 500 of cushion money
<GOOD> That's not realistically that much
<GOOD> Disposable income isn't rlly disposable if some unexpected expenses happen
<GOOD> I want new clothes
<GOOD> Just wish I knew what to look for or what I like
<GOOD> Already wear that
<GOOD> But I want a big coat or jacket :((
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> Nah I like baggy clothes
<GOOD> I just wear T shirts/polos and joggers/jeans since that's all I own
<GOOD> Usually just covered up by the giant fleece weatherproof coat I wear
<GOOD> I don't like showing my legs at all
<GOOD> My belly has fuzz on it and I also dislike showing it in general
<GOOD> Same, big burn scar on my back :/
<GOOD> I love jackets
<GOOD> And yeah I might
<GOOD> Idk why but I always feel so pressured in public spaces
<GOOD> Yeah but it's frustrating for things like the opticians where everyone is being patient and I still feel annoying for not being able to decide
<GOOD> My cheek hurts so much mannnn
<GOOD> Why can't I go a day without some sort of soreness or illness
<GOOD> Only thing I'm buying
<GOOD> I will when I get back to my PC
<GOOD> But yeah I treated myself bc it's 2
<GOOD> I think I have a wisdom tooth coming
<GOOD> It hurts sm
<GOOD> Either that or the most inconveniently placed ulcer I've ever seen
<GOOD> Because it's at the back of my gums and fucking awful
<GOOD> Also I think I have sores on the inside of my cheek idk
<GOOD> It's starting to hurt
<GOOD> It's been 1 day
<GOOD> No, I have had the pain for 1 day
<GOOD> I don't remember
<GOOD> I just don't know because ulcers fucking suck and I've had a few over the last few weeks
<GOOD> Despite brushing
<GOOD> I'll try mouthwash later
<GOOD> You look cool
<GOOD> I like the little chain
<GOOD> I want a trench coat
<GOOD> It would go kind of hard
<GOOD> Prime video is so ass
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I neeeeeeed to do some research into awesome clothss
<GOOD> Navy maybe
<GOOD> I don't like warm colours usually
<GOOD> Maybe I'd look good in a hat
<GOOD> Honestly I wouldn't even be confident saying that considering how JRPGs are
<GOOD> Ok on an exam
<GOOD> 60% or so
<GOOD> And then I aced some coursework across the semester to drag it over the line
<GOOD> NOOOOOOO
<GOOD> Nintendo tried to seal it away and warn us
<GOOD> But the retro was too powerful
<GOOD> If Mario, then only bros...
<GOOD> It's kinda rigged towards Frye with the age range of Splatoon
<GOOD> TIL the first ever YTP is older than I am
<GOOD> 19 years ago today
<GOOD> The first YTP
<GOOD> And apparently
<GOOD> My gf doesn't exist
<GOOD> Doubt it
<GOOD> Ok but I haven't gotten close
<GOOD> Like ever
<GOOD> Can't do that because I don't understand the difference between courtesy and flirting
<GOOD> So I just don't bother
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> Oh no
<GOOD> I mean they'll definitely get struck down but like
<GOOD> Never stopped other R4 cards
<GOOD> I don't have a good singing voice I'm afraid
<GOOD> Yeah but this is a hardware bypass, afaik it's not patchable
<GOOD> And doesnt require solder or however you hack a Switch
<GOOD> Mine has like a 50/50 chance of being hackable and I don't wanna take the risk of bricking my 300 console
<GOOD> I already checked
<GOOD> It said maybe
<GOOD> Oh my god that thing
<GOOD> I've seen it done w Pikmin
<GOOD> Yoi, sry about that but it did get managed
<GOOD> I just had to delegate it because I was putting ice on my face
<GOOD> I have a wisdom tooth growing
<GOOD> I asked ppl to not and then had to leave
<GOOD> Mine is just growing in
<GOOD> Apparently it lasts for months?
<GOOD> I can't stand this pain for nonths
<GOOD> I don't think age plays into it but yes it's shitty
<GOOD> Unless you're calling like, an 8 year old annoying because like ofc they are give them a break they're annoying
<GOOD> Me and my friends seem to be joining team Friends
<GOOD> The original image says Family yes
<GOOD> I can't get over this video
<GOOD> They even added the tiny echo
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I honestly have no clue what I'm getting
<GOOD> I asked for Pikmin but my mom just like, forgot I asked for it despite it being my only gift I asked for
<GOOD> So let's see what happens
<GOOD> I saw that earlier today
<GOOD> It's ironic but funny af
<GOOD> Remembering I grew up with this game lmao
<GOOD> What was Square's deal why does this game exist
<GOOD> WHEN ARE WE GETTING THE DLC
<GOOD> Pikmin 4 is epic
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> P good so far
<GOOD> Family game night is going ok
<GOOD> Trying to decide between DK Tropical Freeze and Metroid Prime Remastered rn
<GOOD> Ok I think I'm quitting this gacha
<GOOD> That's the last one I had and it almost made me bruise my leg so
<GOOD> I've never spent on it
<GOOD> No, I've just never spent on gacha games
<GOOD> Because their offers are ass
<GOOD> We dealt my dog into blackjack
<GOOD> Dipper
<GOOD> Pimin 4
<GOOD> She sat there completely stone faced for multiple minutes so I'm inclined to agree
<GOOD> I watched the Ghosts Crimis special
<GOOD> I like Ghosts it's pretty funni
<GOOD> Maybe this is my fashion frfr
<GOOD> He's built like my grandpa (neutral statement)
<GOOD> I've noticed a pattern in my twitter feed where every post about the FGC is made by NB people and the only NB people on there are those people lmao
<GOOD> Is there something I'm missing
<GOOD> Dandoriing out rn
<GOOD> I need to get better at Dandori battles tho
<GOOD> Couldn't be me, I'm all out of gender
<GOOD> Fudge is mid
<GOOD> First RBY team done
<GOOD> I may have cooked
<GOOD> Tbf it does look goofier
<GOOD> 100%'d 3 areas in Pik 4 now
<GOOD> I must continue onto the 4th area
<GOOD> What is Oneshot
<GOOD> And who is Niko Oneshot and why is their design so gas
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I've drank like 2 cups of cider and nothing else, my dad is making fun of me for not drinking more
<GOOD> I haven't tried it
<GOOD> I've wanted to try a starter wine
<GOOD> But like idk what type of wine is a bit more fruity
<GOOD> Where you can actually taste the fruit flavour
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> I had some blueberry cider
<GOOD> Hour and 6 here
<GOOD> Yeah my dog is going through it rn
<GOOD> Over multiple years of this she's learned to mellow out more tho
<GOOD> Rn she's sleeping
<GOOD> My mom gave me some sort of winey drink with a lemonade mixer and it was nice
<GOOD> I feel so sad I didn't cop this earlier
<GOOD> I decided not to
<GOOD> Is that where the Queen Elizabeth Reboot Card image is coming from
<GOOD> I honestly don't know what Pikmin merch to try and get
<GOOD> Pikmin actually has my favourite official plushie ever made
<GOOD> I really want it
<GOOD> I love Olimar because he isn't some scrunkly baby
<GOOD> He's a 40 year old husband and father with a gambling addict wife and father issues
<GOOD> Yeah lmao
<GOOD> It reminds me of when people call Bob Odenkirk scrunkly
<GOOD> Olimar is the most oddly introspective and interesting Nintendo protagonist imo
<GOOD> He's so weird I love him
<GOOD> Also how did I not know there is an official pikmin manga
<GOOD> I love this
<GOOD> The style is adorable
<GOOD> Oatchi fucking killing Pikmin being the punchline is so funny
<GOOD> Also Pikmin 4 has dialogue where a scientist dude says he knows certain pikmin are immune to certain things by implying he experimented on them by setting them on fire and shit
<GOOD> And gassing them with toxic gas
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> Mildly buzzed
<GOOD> But depressed
<GOOD> This unit art is so funny
<GOOD> Vegeta is so short it's funny af
<GOOD> Sans with a Gun now
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> 2024 is going badly already
<GOOD> Not like, personally tho
<GOOD> Earthquake and also the Square Enix thing
<GOOD> They sent out like an email saying they are going to use AI aggressively
<GOOD> Use it a lot
<GOOD> At least there's the Midjourney scandal to balance it out
<GOOD> Could reach an endpoint eventually
<GOOD> Yeah but it's a matter of time
<GOOD> Eventually that feedback loop won't matter unfortunately
<GOOD> Pikmin gave me a headache
<GOOD> So I had to stop
<GOOD> I own a Gardevoir fit I paid for in Unite once
<GOOD> Barista outfit
<GOOD> But that's the only time I ever spent money on Unite because first purchase is half off
<GOOD> And it was already exorbitantly priced
<GOOD> Raaaagh I love pikmin images creating genetic links based on phylogeny
<GOOD> Grubdog lore
<GOOD> Past the credits, I'm in Giant's Hearth rn
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I am chasing him
<GOOD> I laughed
<GOOD> I didn't expect to see him
<GOOD> But rn I have a headache so I'm not playing
<GOOD> Because the genetics in Pikmin are a big part
<GOOD> Pikmin is meant to emulate a real ecosystem partly
<GOOD> They're closer to carrots
<GOOD> Their closest in game base is that they look like pikpik carrots
<GOOD> Which is why they're called pikmin
<GOOD> Nah that's Louie
<GOOD> I bought Sam and Max hit the road and that's about it
<GOOD> Haven't played it yet though
<GOOD> Oh and Chrono Trigger
<GOOD> When a pikcel says something so grubdogphobic you have to hit them with the Oatchi Rush stare
<GOOD> I never noticed
<GOOD> I like Sandslash
<GOOD> What is it called
<GOOD> It is Yellow
<GOOD> Also the copyright thing was dumb af, I hope Toby Fox blows up at the asshole in that music company
<GOOD> Pretty
<GOOD> I like the plaid
<GOOD> Very cool tho
<GOOD> I saw this earlier lmao
<GOOD> I wanna see ppl use Oswald and Willie or Mickey together
<GOOD> I can't believe that you can now name a character mickey mouse and actually make it look like a mouse
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> Pretty women
<GOOD> I told my irl friend ily and she didn't mind :DD
<GOOD> Granted I was tipsy but oh well
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> I thought it was just a skirt with the black pattern on top tbh
<GOOD> She didn't say it back but she said I'm good and she doesn't mind if I say it so
<GOOD> It's so funny that this design and name are usable by anyone now but if you make his gloves white it oversteps
<GOOD> Idk could have fooled me, I just thought it was a pretty plaid skirt
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I still haven't figured out my style
<GOOD> I wanna wear so many baggy clothes
<GOOD> Wearing those giant ass trousers
<GOOD> Giant jacket too
<GOOD> I love big jackets and coats
<GOOD> I was thinking it but like, does it look weird to just wear a trench coat
<GOOD> I'm talking about just wear a trench coat as in I don't see people wear them
<GOOD> Like people just don't do that so it makes me nervous
<GOOD> I would love one of those
<GOOD> And a cool hat
<GOOD> Professor Layton type fit
<GOOD> I don't like tight shirts
<GOOD> I don't even mind how I'm built i just do not like showing how I look
<GOOD> I wanna cover my form as much as possible
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> I NEED
<GOOD> Also it makes me sad that when I look at trench coats there isn't a single masc model or anything, it kinda makes me feel weird and idk why
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> All women's trench coats whatever that means
<GOOD> Idk it's mostly for the longer/less fitting ones which I like
<GOOD> I'm NB but I'm masc leaning
<GOOD> Sometimes
<GOOD> I don't like skirts/dresses I'm saying that rn
<GOOD> Haven't had a chance
<GOOD> Omg with a hood that could look awesome
<GOOD> I NEEED
<GOOD> I WANT
<GOOD> One on the front one on the back
<GOOD> So I can wrap my head up like a cocoon
<GOOD> I wear skinny jeans rn anyway because I don't own others
<GOOD> I have literally just jeans and like 2 pairs of joggers it sucks
<GOOD> Ooooo
<GOOD> Beige feels like my type
<GOOD> Goddd I want to buy clothes now
<GOOD> I mostly wear like, hiking boots lmao (I also need to buy other shoes but I do have other options dw)
<GOOD> I mostly just dress in whatever I can be bothered to put on rn
<GOOD> Because they're comfy
<GOOD> And they repel water
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I have One Piece Vans and regular Vans
<GOOD> So I will go with regular
<GOOD> Need to wear this more fr
<GOOD> These are the One Piece vans lmao
<GOOD> Good for summer
<GOOD> Collab
<GOOD> My dad does too, my first conversation with him when I came back from uni started with don't let them push the woke agenda on you
<GOOD> Like, he said that word for word
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> My dad is also a bald white bearded man
<GOOD> My dad has started pissing me off more and more tbh
<GOOD> He said he doesn't mind people selling dangerous/illegal vapes to kids because the police are trying to keep the public down by stopping their income
<GOOD> My dad yells at me for going to the bathroom lmao
<GOOD> Worst take ever???
<GOOD> Like I don't see where that conclusion even comes from
<GOOD> Ancient Aliens
<GOOD> I have to assume my dad believes in at least a few conspiracies
<GOOD> I just don't know which
<GOOD> Too obsessed with the woke agenda
<GOOD> I mean I learned how developed the Aztecs(?) Were yesterday, that was interesting
<GOOD> I was misinformed before, apparently they had whole sewage systems and proper hygiene
<GOOD> I may
<GOOD> Also my mom tries to be open to stuff she doesn't know but her calling trans people woke people because she thinks trans is an offensive word makes me have to stifle a laugh
<GOOD> If only my parents knew I was trans
<GOOD> Jk they'll never know
<GOOD> Yeah and she is
<GOOD> My mom is lovely
<GOOD> She just has that ingrained offensive term thing that some older people have that sucks :/
<GOOD> I wish she'd kick it but oh well
<GOOD> Better than my dad
<GOOD> Idk anything about politics I ignore it
<GOOD> Like that's bad for me but I genuinely just don't know
<GOOD> Plus my therapist said I should be less concerned with global issues
<GOOD> I mean my existence is I just acknowledge people want me to not exist and go yeah fuck those people
<GOOD> I'll learn when I have to vote
<GOOD> Which is probably soon
<GOOD> Pimin 4 progress raaaa
<GOOD> Only 50% of the last area to go
<GOOD> I love Moss
<GOOD> Moss
<GOOD> Louie is the right person
<GOOD> He's cracked as fuck at Dandori he almost beat me
<GOOD> I did that too I just didn't realise he was gonna make Moss swallow the sneak bomb
<GOOD> So I couldn't stop him
<GOOD> Yeah I just didn't know Moss ate it
<GOOD> This is the fire one
<GOOD> Where you have red Piks and carry the fire thing around
<GOOD> I didn't lose it was just close
<GOOD> Yeah I'm 50% done w the woods now
<GOOD> Primordial Thicket I think it's called
<GOOD> I like them
<GOOD> I've done everything except the last area's night missions
<GOOD> Nor the 2 Emperor Bulblaxes
<GOOD> look at these awesome fits I'm checking out
<GOOD> They're so cool
<GOOD> It's tragic what happened to him, I don't even like the dude all that much but that girl video was the most inoffensive stuff possible
<GOOD> Same I'm tired of a shirt and jeans
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> I wanna complete a fit
<GOOD> Yes I love them
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Hallooo
<GOOD> Tired
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> I woke up an hour ago
<GOOD> I wish
<GOOD> Piccolo in item shop
<GOOD> May have to treat myself
<GOOD> I crumbled
<GOOD> I sang Weezer at someone and they shot me
<GOOD> I love him
<GOOD> I couldn't resist piccolo
<GOOD> I got his bundle and that's all I need
<GOOD> I now own Gojo, Sasuke and Piccolo
<GOOD> Orange piccolo is beasthan if he was good
<GOOD> I like him being an uncle to Pan
<GOOD> I think Gromit, Olimar and Piccolo are my comfort characters tbh
<GOOD> I'm in a dilemma
<GOOD> I could refund Gojo rn and buy Frieza, Cell, Beerus or Goku Black
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Raaaa final boss and dungeon beaten first try
<GOOD> Ok I guess I have my new favourite Nintendo boss of all time
<GOOD> Fucking amazing
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> Sirehound
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> What romhack is this
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> Interesting
<GOOD> Godddd it was such a good boss
<GOOD> I love the design
<GOOD> I brought mostly purples with no elemental pikmin
<GOOD> So fun as fuck
<GOOD> Mhm, I'm only 1 treasure away now anyway
<GOOD> And then platinum dandori medals, louie quests, and Olimar's thing
<GOOD> Are they the flower and bloom ones
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> Which ones
<GOOD> Because I have all of the science lab and Oatchi ones
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Nah idm
<GOOD> Is it 1000 weight swallow
<GOOD> I already have those
<GOOD> I've been 100%ing absolutely everything as I went along
<GOOD> So by the time I was halfway through the primordial thicket I was done
<GOOD> I also need 100 purples for the stupid ass gold bar
<GOOD> I know there are purple and white onions I just don't know how to get em
<GOOD> I'll find out eventually
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> Harder than Cavern for a king?
<GOOD> Damn and I struggled there
<GOOD> I only finished with 6 pikmin
<GOOD> The true Dandori trial...
<GOOD> Do you need to plat them
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Do you need to plat them all in sequence
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Also he is my new favourite nintendo boss
<GOOD> The electric phase was so stressful without yellows
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I did use bombs on the empress bulblax tho
<GOOD> That was kinda cheaty
<GOOD> The water man at legs level was annoying af
<GOOD> I had 20 water pikmin and he shot 13 of them because I didn't realise shaking them off made them idle
<GOOD> Hop off
<GOOD> Almost as if you need 50 fucking ice pikmin for that
<GOOD> It isn't easy if you don't know what's coming
<GOOD> Didn't wanna use items unless I was desperate
<GOOD> So like
<GOOD> Why was Louie kidnapping people
<GOOD> Like he mentions that he stole the Koppaites' juice and they passed out from starvation
<GOOD> But why did he steal them
<GOOD> I love how people say shit like this and this is the mf we're talking about
<GOOD> Pimin is awesome
<GOOD> You will be taken to the onion
<GOOD> For your crimes
<GOOD> You will be turned into a Leafling to learn Dandori
<GOOD> I honestly forgot Louie's thing was that he was told to do what Olimar does by Shacho
<GOOD> Tbf he does show some agency over his own actions
<GOOD> Both of the times he does he tames a giant fuckoff weaponised animal tho
<GOOD> I still have no idea how he even went about making the titan dweevil
<GOOD> Like he just got a bunch of war crime causing weapons
<GOOD> He's better at Dandori than Olimar and forcefully fused technology into a super robot
<GOOD> But it's suggested the Dweevil was not already like that
<GOOD> I would believe fully that Louie was planning to eat Brittany tbh
<GOOD> I'm gonna headcanon that he was trying to turn Brittany and the other pikmin 3 dudes into leaflings so he could see how they taste
<GOOD> Bring back Shacho
<GOOD> After I beat 4 I'm buying 3
<GOOD> SHACHO RAAAA
<GOOD> Also is it bad that Louie is one of my favourite nintendo villains
<GOOD> He's just so strange I love him
<GOOD> Also I didn't realise there were planets other than Hocotate
<GOOD> Like Koppai and a bunch of other random planets and races are brought up and not rlly touched on
<GOOD> Except that Koppaites are smart apparently
<GOOD> There's a good reason they were in debt
<GOOD> Also i assumed it wouldn't be all of the people on every planet are the same
<GOOD> I thought by other planets we'd have aliens and stuff
<GOOD> It smushes every game together
<GOOD> I must pick men
<GOOD> Also in 4 is it Olimar's 3rd crash
<GOOD> But Louie is there
<GOOD> So 2 never happened?
<GOOD> Thank fuck
<GOOD> Who up pluckin they purples rn
<GOOD> Flying pikmin are so weird why don't they just fly at night to not die on the ground
<GOOD> I love strong women
<GOOD> Wait what 2 was actually a dream what
<GOOD> I use them for ferrying stuff over swamps and annoying shit
<GOOD> Pikmin ball
<GOOD> Shacho Rocket!?!?
<GOOD> Trying not to talk about how the bad emding continues
<GOOD> Does that mean Shacho isn't real
<GOOD> That fucking floor on the final dungeon in 4 with 2 water wraiths lmao
<GOOD> Also I do have a good use for flying pikmin in 4
<GOOD> Killing those long leg enemies, I forgot the name of the green one
<GOOD> Damn this tweet doing numbers
<GOOD> That Olimar is financially stable
<GOOD> He has to to keep his head above the water
<GOOD> His wife spends all his spare income on gambling
<GOOD> Amnesia
<GOOD> No proof
<GOOD> Eepy
<GOOD> I'm eepy because I'm tired
<GOOD> Also Olimar is my favourite Nintendo protag he's awesome
<GOOD> He's just a middle aged balding man
<GOOD> With a loving wife and kids and he works for fed-ex
<GOOD> Doesn't Olimar appear in Pikmin 3 as well
<GOOD> I forgot
<GOOD> Wouldn't that not make sense because he would have already been leafed by then
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> So it goes 1, 4, 3
<GOOD> And 2 is just in the aether
<GOOD> Yeah but 4 flashes back to 1
<GOOD> It retcons it but chronologically still happens first
<GOOD> Pikmin 1 WHAT
<GOOD> Movies?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Also doesn't the ending of Pikmin 4 suggest that Pikmin will become the apex predators on Hocotate forever now
<GOOD> Sorry right
<GOOD> 404
<GOOD> I'm tired ok
<GOOD> But like yeah Moss existing now means that the Pikmin become self sufficient
<GOOD> Yeah they're fucking idiots and forget the near death experience they have 5 seconds before they carry raw materials across the exact same path they came
<GOOD> I mean they partially do but only in the sense that the ones under Oleafmar's control know what to do
<GOOD> Idk how pik 1's ending translated to the entire species knowing how to defend itself tho
<GOOD> Yeah but the whole species?
<GOOD> Onion
<GOOD> They reproduce via onion
<GOOD> All of the onions
<GOOD> It sucks up corpses and pellet posies and shits out Pikmin
<GOOD> They are also spaceships
<GOOD> Didn't even tell you about leaflings
<GOOD> Or the fact that if something gains a pikmin sprout it gets terminally ill when it leaves PNF-404's atmosphere
<GOOD> Idk, it's not really like anything
<GOOD> Like what do you even compare this to
<GOOD> It is a leafling
<GOOD> If unconscious people get carried into the onion, they turn into these things
<GOOD> And they become obsessed with Dandori and literally nothing else
<GOOD> Pikmin are suggested to be a partially parasitic species
<GOOD> Because they are a means to an end in Pikmin
<GOOD> You aren't strong enough to do the things you need to, the Pikmin are
<GOOD> Plus Pikmin aren't like, hostile
<GOOD> They don't carry unconscious people to the onion just because
<GOOD> They only do it in Pikmin 1's bad ending because Olimar would have died without it
<GOOD> I mean he still hasn't
<GOOD> In the current canon Olimar almost choked on toxic oxygen and died in Pikmin 1
<GOOD> And being turned into a leafling allowed him to live
<GOOD> He has a wife and kids
<GOOD> They can't financially survive without him
<GOOD> Where is the Shacho version
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I would call him a villain
<GOOD> In Pikmin 2 maybe not but in 4 he causes people to starve almost to death, kidnaps them, tries to turn them into leaflings etc
<GOOD> Also apparently in Pikmin 3 he steals juice from the S.S Drake
<GOOD> Which is something I'm barely aware of
<GOOD> Yeah but like, following orders can only be not villainous up to a point
<GOOD> If you kill someone and in your mind you were following orders, you were still evil for it
<GOOD> It strips them of their consciousness
<GOOD> Also he caused starvation
<GOOD> Yes, because he himself was a leafling
<GOOD> Leafling Olimar is not normal Olimar
<GOOD> They are different peoole
<GOOD> Yeah but I think louie is really pushing it
<GOOD> I thought he was the reason that Alph's brother and stuff were stranded and unconscious
<GOOD> So he didn't raid them for juice as they crashed and carry them off
<GOOD> I think Louie is unhinged enough to be a villain
<GOOD> Oh also, does the Sirehound get tamed after Moss leaves Louie in 4 or does he have both tamed
<GOOD> Because they mention a giant dog but idk if that dog is ever identified as Moss or if Louie just had the Sirehound
<GOOD> Then was the original dog Moss?
<GOOD> I'm so curious as to how Louie even tamed the Sirehound
<GOOD> Like it seems fairly agreeable once Louie is taken away but come on
<GOOD> Also can I just say how cool it is that the Sirehound has narrow early windows where you can throw purples onto its tail
<GOOD> My new favourite nintendo boss
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> Like, there aren't all that many contenders for amazing Nintendo bosses
<GOOD> Idk about 3D Mario
<GOOD> I never felt it
<GOOD> Yeah but even then
<GOOD> Bouldergeist is the one I remember most tbh
<GOOD> Bowser's final fight is a really cool spectacle but the actual gameplay of it is just good
<GOOD> Zelda bosses I have no idea about, and Kirby I'm iffy on
<GOOD> Xenoblade I guarantee I would like less than Sirehound
<GOOD> I've played the open world ones and Link Between Worlds
<GOOD> I can't get a hang of OoT's controls
<GOOD> Because I've played a few entries and they just weren't that good as bosses
<GOOD> Triple DX, Epic Yarn, original Kirby and uhhh
<GOOD> Most of Robobot
<GOOD> I am aware
<GOOD> I vaguely remember Void Termina I have played that like once
<GOOD> Magolor is my favourite kirby character but I do not put his boss above Sirehound
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I just didn't enjoy it as much
<GOOD> I honestly just lost interest in Kirby
<GOOD> Also I believe I have played the Wii version of Return to Dream Land idk
<GOOD> Yeah then I did
<GOOD> I have played a few Kirby games but I was young when I played them
<GOOD> And they were still very easy
<GOOD> Like I understand it's made for everyone but dude
<GOOD> I get that but it's so uninteresting to me as that
<GOOD> I enjoyed them kinda but they just aren't fun if I play them a lot
<GOOD> I beat most of Robobot in 1 sitting
<GOOD> Because I was just walking through levels
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> And then Zelda is like
<GOOD> I've literally never been interested in Zelda, despite playing the games and liking them
<GOOD> My brain has never suggested to me to play Zelda, I just kinda got the games and played them and they were good
<GOOD> And then when I tried OoT I just couldn't be bothered
<GOOD> I didn't get far, I didn't do much, I just didn't like how it controlled
<GOOD> Wind Waker is one I want to go back to though
<GOOD> Idk I just didn't get the appeal of Zelda
<GOOD> The epic stories I have experienced were TotK so that doesn't exactly convince me
<GOOD> I don't remember the plot of Link Between Worlds but I imagine it is very similar to most other Zelda stories
<GOOD> Yeah because Skyward Sword happens before the whole reviving Link and Ganon thing
<GOOD> Apparently
<GOOD> So it is the game where Link and Ganon don't fight every reincarnation
<GOOD> I've had Zelda lore explained to me before and it still just doesn't seem interesting
<GOOD> Like some parts do and then it's like, apparently they can just break the triforce and they have done so
<GOOD> Maybe I just can't digest longer games like I used to
<GOOD> I haven't been engaged in many games' plots
<GOOD> Like, it's incredibly hard to even hook me on a game on story
<GOOD> Oh I also played like an hour of Amazing Mirror and iirc I got nowhere
<GOOD> And didn't understand a thing about the game
<GOOD> I just walked around for an hour then quit
<GOOD> I just have bad taste
<GOOD> No but like, I don't like good things apparently
<GOOD> I do not mind things being story heavy I mind them being story heavy while also being boring
<GOOD> If I'm gonna be dragged out of gameplay for story it better be good
<GOOD> Though considering my experience with Persona 5 the masterpiece in narrative storytelling or something, maybe I just don't like stories
<GOOD> People never hop off Persona 5
<GOOD> Not even Atlus
<GOOD> Yeah but I don't like, get it
<GOOD> I once had someone tell me that the first like, 5 palaces are not that great
<GOOD> I've also heard 3
<GOOD> But like, that's so many fucking hours
<GOOD> I did not even get to the palace itself
<GOOD> I got to the planning for the palace, and gave up
<GOOD> By that point I'd spent like 9 hours in the game and I hadn't gotten to play, and then when I do the tutorial on the menus and submenus and confidants or whatever was so wordy and complicated
<GOOD> Like for all the hands-on long drawn out tutorials they did, the most complicated part of the game so far was just a couple slides of text to click through
<GOOD> I gave up because the story was dragging so much and Kamoshida did not interest me
<GOOD> Like they could have tipped me off the first time I met the dude that Kamoshida was an asshole and a creep, but then they spend so so so much more time driving home how annoying and awful and creepy he is
<GOOD> Like yes I get it he is an abuser he fucking sucks
<GOOD> And his arc is probably I was that and now I'm not
<GOOD> It just doesn't seem like a compelling arc to have a character be forced into being like oh I feel bad now
<GOOD> If there is a suprising twist to this character with the nuance of a bucket of cement being thrown at my head then I will be suprised
<GOOD> So like, what's compelling
<GOOD> He regrets it, he probably admits it, he goes to jail
<GOOD> All of these just seem like natural and fairly reasonable and predictable things to happen tho
<GOOD> So what I already knew in the first few hours of the game is exactly what happens for the rest of it
<GOOD> Yeah, but this dude abused my friend, so I want to get revenge isn't some huge unexpected thing it's very clear that Kamoshida is an awful person that will get comeuppance immediately and Anne wanting to help isn't some groundbreaking thing
<GOOD> It also just doesn't make me feel... anything?
<GOOD> Like I've just met these people I don't care about them yet pulling these cards isn't really gonna make me shocked
<GOOD> Something that interested me
<GOOD> I kinda got that with the first accidental palace visit and the velvet room but then they make you revisit the palace again for no reason other than a tutorial and hey Kamoshida is still an awful person
<GOOD> Like yes I get it he is 1 dimensional he is the first antagonist can we move on
<GOOD> I know nothing about the other Personas
<GOOD> I do not expect an arc from him
<GOOD> I already said, it was clear upon meeting him literally one time that he is an awful creepy asshole and the student with the bruises shows he's abusive, and that's his character
<GOOD> They did not need to drag their feet on him, he is an asshole and it didn't need to be driven home more
<GOOD> This is also interesting and fucked up, but instead of any nuance it's hey let's visit the palace and see that Kamoshida is extra extra fucked up and creepy
<GOOD> I do not mind that I just didn't like having to go back to the palace for no reason
<GOOD> Could the fucked up treadmill stuff not just have been part of the actual palace heist
<GOOD> Like, the game railroads you and holds your hand right up until the heist planning, where they give you all of that as a lump of text and drop you
<GOOD> The 2nd visit lends literally nothing to the game
<GOOD> It's just like, the most boring game that I've played some amount of time playing waiting for it to get good
<GOOD> I kinda liked Morgana for a bit because he was a cat
<GOOD> I literally only liked him because he was a cat
<GOOD> The rest didn't make an impression because the game didn't make me wanna see more of em so
<GOOD> Boo womp
<GOOD> And I only wanted to see more of Morgana because he looked like that and I was just like lmao
<GOOD> Is that her phantom thief outfit
<GOOD> Because like my only memory of Ann was the fucked up one that Kamoshida had in his palace and her phantom thief outfit which is a kinda mid impression to leave
<GOOD> Idk design just plays a lot into my interest in a character
<GOOD> I do not like Joker's design, Anne's is ok, Ryuji I have 0 opinion on
<GOOD> Like I saw this design and was like this certainly is a person
<GOOD> Maybe I should stick to games with creatures in the main cast
<GOOD> That aren't also pervs
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> Starting to sink back into my depression methinks
<GOOD> Because rn I just feel like a hateful PoS that doesn't like anything
<GOOD> Teehee
<GOOD> I should stick to Donkey Kong or smth
<GOOD> Ok so Xenoblade's token creatura looks kinda ugly ngl
<GOOD> What the fuck is this
<GOOD> I've been recommended SMT
<GOOD> And it has a funny fellow in it so I am inclined to want to try it
<GOOD> See that sounds amazing
<GOOD> I do not want indigestible stories
<GOOD> Because then I wouldn't know what the fuck is happening
<GOOD> I'm playing Chrono Trigger rn but after that it's probably SMTV and 4
<GOOD> Why do people want more
<GOOD> Don't they have like 3 Persona 5 games that are not Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal
<GOOD> Morgana {landotraisedeyebrow}
<GOOD> Idk a loud pervy mascot type character sounds not great
<GOOD> Just because I remember something it doesn't make it good
<GOOD> I don't really see what's getting people so divisive over Morgana
<GOOD> Yeah because the cast and story weren't anything
<GOOD> Also that sounds like a non-divisive character arc
<GOOD> Know is an overstatement
<GOOD> Idk p5 is just the game I had the least takeaway from ever from trying it
<GOOD> Like I've played many games but P5 stuck with me as the one where I spent 10 hours playing it and there was no takeaway from it or understanding of anything about why ppl like it
<GOOD> It's the only game where I've ever been that confused
<GOOD> ~~then again usually when I spend 50 on a game I don't quit it~~
<GOOD> Wait fuck now I'm trying to think of games I've actually not finished after playing a few hours
<GOOD> I don't think Pushmo for the 3DS counts
<GOOD> I thought that orb thing was from a different franchise
<GOOD> Reeheeehee being smothered under depression and self loathing again
<GOOD> Did not even last a month
<GOOD> And now I'm in pain because I'm upset
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Still shitty from yesterday
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> I splurged and spent 35
<GOOD> I bought gunpla and an Ito novel yahoo
<GOOD> I unlocked trial of the sage leaf
<GOOD> Did 2 floors and am taking a break since I did Olimar before in 1 sitting
<GOOD> Gold and Plat
<GOOD> I failed the 3rd one once and decided I needed to relax a lil
<GOOD> 2 hours and done
<GOOD> Not too hard but fun
<GOOD> What are those devices that like, are apparently very painful but cut your hair down
<GOOD> No I just remember there's some device
<GOOD> Yep that's the one you rung a bell
<GOOD> Ok so an epilator sounds agonising
<GOOD> It's like a razor but it tears the hairs from the roots
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I just fucking hate my body hair ngl
<GOOD> I need to shave it
<GOOD> I have leg hair
<GOOD> I hate it
<GOOD> Also I think I'm gonna cop one of these hats
<GOOD> I could pull one off maybe
<GOOD> Idk I just want this hair gone
<GOOD> I really can't but I guess I should just buy a better electric shaver
<GOOD> Damn this book good af so far
<GOOD> Unfortunately just very time consuming because every few days imma have to do that as well as my face
<GOOD> No one ever sees my legs and I'm still v v self conscious about them
<GOOD> I don't take em so yahoo must do often
<GOOD> Better than looking at myself and being like ew
<GOOD> Constantly
<GOOD> Jumpscare
<GOOD> Finding a list of NB characters rn and people are just arguing over whether they are or aren't
<GOOD> Someone said Pitou under this but like it was the other way around too lmao
<GOOD> Also I didn't know Pitou was Agender because the translations I read gendered them
<GOOD> But the translation team couldn't make up their mind so every time the chapter changed Pitou would change pronouns
<GOOD> Wokegeta
<GOOD> Also it's funny af that all of the NB characters being talked about are either multiple people, robots or that one NB guilty gear character
<GOOD> Gogeta is they
<GOOD> Erm I said wokegeta
<GOOD> Apparently in japanese Frieza uses gender neutral pronouns
<GOOD> That's neat
<GOOD> Does this mean NB people get Frieza
<GOOD> This reply is so funny to me because it categorises almost every NB character I've seen
<GOOD> Either fem leaning humans, fusions of multiple people or masc leaning/fully androgynous robots
<GOOD> My GOAT
<GOOD> (Frieza is he/they NB I love them)
<GOOD> Fart
<GOOD> Why are all of the DBZ villains after Saiyan saga either robots, more than 1 person or Frieza
<GOOD> More than 1 person
<GOOD> He is also an android but not in the same sense
<GOOD> I would say that absorbing someone counts as being 2 people
<GOOD> Erm
<GOOD> Cell is a flesh robot end of story
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> He/they
<GOOD> However fusion warriors are my GOAT NBs
<GOOD> They are also he/they (apart from Kefla but who cares about Kefla)
<GOOD> But this time the being 2 people is a mutual understanding
<GOOD> And not just eating them or being made of the DNA of a bunch of people at once (Cell)
<GOOD> She does but it's depressing that she does
<GOOD> Doesn't understand gender because they spend all their time screaming and murdering people
<GOOD> So probably agender (yahoo another agender rep)
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It's an animal
<GOOD> Gender was invented by bathroom companies
<GOOD> Do not let Big Toilet boss you around
<GOOD> Kid named boo
<GOOD> Also I'm saving the rest of my Vbucks until ballin emote comes back
<GOOD> Unless I decide to buy Party Rock Anthem
<GOOD> why did someone say this person was NB
<GOOD> Isn't this the strong cleave guy
<GOOD> They make Goku give birth
<GOOD> Goku rn:
<GOOD> Dandori...
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> This book is very strange
<GOOD> It's not a scary concept really but it got made into one
<GOOD> Just read Gyo by Junji Ito
<GOOD> Rlly good it made me feel sick
<GOOD> Main character
<GOOD> Fiddlebert
<GOOD> Yeah it's rlly good
<GOOD> Solid af body horror and terrifying concept
<GOOD> I just wanna read more Ito
<GOOD> Already becoming one of my favourite authors
<GOOD> I have almost done everything in Pikmin
<GOOD> Pikmin 4 at least
<GOOD> The last few things are hell tho
<GOOD> My family is watching FNAF movie rn and my mom foolishly asked what happened in the games compared to the movie
<GOOD> I'm getting to the part with the death robot that Henry builds to die to
<GOOD> Only Sage Leaf trials remain and then I have 100%'d Pikmin 4 truly
<GOOD> I have to Platinum medal them
<GOOD> Yeah, I can't believe a pokemon could OHKO Sewaddle with 0 IVs
<GOOD> Only if it doesn't tera
<GOOD> LOUIE
<GOOD> YOU FUCK
<GOOD> HE'S TRAILING LIKE 90 POINTS BEHIND BUT WON'T LET ME DECIMATE HIM
<GOOD> I need to beat this Dandori battle but Louie isn't shit enough to lose completely but he's shit enough to lose every time by a significant amount of points
<GOOD> I think the range is percentile
<GOOD> It does anywhere from like 80 to 100% of the damage it's meant to
<GOOD> Why did they rename it here
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I live in the UK, which is why I said why did they rename it here (the UK)
<GOOD> But the game isn't called Mario Soccer
<GOOD> Yeah but like, Mario Strikers is the name originally
<GOOD> Mario does in fact smash football
<GOOD> Maybe we wouldn't get it if it was called Mario Strikers
<GOOD> Fuck I wish this game was good this is like the most appealing cover art for a game I've ever seen
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> WHY ARE THE COVER ARTS FOR MARIO STRIKERS SO RAW
<GOOD> DAMN
<GOOD> My perception of Mario Strikers has forever been ruined by the nintendo youtube shorts tho lmao
<GOOD> What's the issue with that one
<GOOD> There's a ton of these
<GOOD> They're selling to 5 year olds this will work
<GOOD> Wdym this is literally me
<GOOD> It's very relatable
<GOOD> Olimar: EEEEEYIKES! I have to 'pick' these 'men' or I'll die of oxygen poisoning!
Pikmin 1 Smoky Progg:
<GOOD> Smoky Progg is the only enemy in the franchise that actively goes after the Onion in Pikmin
<GOOD> Wario really said grahahaha *slap* GROAAAAAHHHHH
<GOOD> I mean it's fun af to fight him usually
<GOOD> Apart from when like 30 pikmin get a whiff of its gloom gas and die instantly
<GOOD> Smoky Progg and Water Wraith are the 2 most infamous enemies
<GOOD> Idk if 3 and 4 actually have any that are like them
<GOOD> Why would it be called Pikmin
<GOOD> Louie
<GOOD> Gatling groinks....
<GOOD> Why did you make me remember that pikmin 2 exists
<GOOD> What the fuck is this
<GOOD> Is this a groink blowhog
<GOOD> With snitchbug arms
<GOOD> What are the other appendages from
<GOOD> Mamuta?
<GOOD> I love Mamuta
<GOOD> I try to not kill them
<GOOD> Also that's a cool prerelease image where it has green eyes
<GOOD> I plan to buy every variation of every Pikmin
<GOOD> It goes to the onion to murder them
<GOOD> Pik 2 is like 50 it seems
<GOOD> Not too bad
<GOOD> Japanese pik 2
<GOOD> So I can use those awesome e reader perks
<GOOD> Nah I'm kidding
<GOOD> Tho I really wanna play the GBA Pikmin ereader puzzles
<GOOD> They seem fun
<GOOD> I plan to
<GOOD> I just gotta get back to my PC
<GOOD> And decide which to start on
<GOOD> That sounds not interesting ngl
<GOOD> Idk I don't like randomisers
<GOOD> It's just like yeah fuck off, smoky progg
<GOOD> Yeah I'm gonna try that or the big cave ones
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> I only have 8GB
<GOOD> I need to buy more dediddadaded Wam
<GOOD> Also need to upgrade my fucking storage
<GOOD> Adds Oatchi
<GOOD> Oh also Vill I did every sage trial
<GOOD> And then got every plat in dandori challenge and battle minus 1
<GOOD> Easy enough but platting is gonna be a nightmare
<GOOD> Probably the white pikmin one
<GOOD> Or the raw material transport
<GOOD> Dreading platting the 99 enemy one because it seems almost wholly random
<GOOD> Oh and the water wraith one
<GOOD> Because I tell Oatchi to move faster and deliver the fucking purple onion and he's like
<GOOD> It's just annoying because their pathing is random
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I ignore the first hydro jelly, knock down the purple onion, kill the jelly with the ice piks inside and break the hydro jelly, get the bomb, use both candypops, break the wall and play linearly after that
<GOOD> Idk whether to take the path with the dried leaf enemies or the path with the fake poison frog thing
<GOOD> I forget the name
<GOOD> Just down to optimisation ig
<GOOD> Based universe
<GOOD> We love chaos!!! (Volume warning)
<GOOD> WoU is awesome
<GOOD> Is there a reward for all platinum medals on everything
<GOOD> This is funny af who made this
<GOOD> Hmmmm
<GOOD> Creature
<GOOD> SIX WHAT!?
<GOOD> Have you not seen the image
<GOOD> Jesus was from Nazareth hope this helps!!!
<GOOD> Perfect
<GOOD> I assume so considering the character they are based on is an adult
<GOOD> I'm jumbo josh bruh
<GOOD> All some people need is just one piece
<GOOD> Having a conversation in a different server for the first time in ages rn and I feel so refreshed
<GOOD> Did you know this is the only server I've ever been properly active in
<GOOD> Other servers are so nice
<GOOD> I've been sealed in this server for 3 years
<GOOD> May be time for me to unchain myself
<GOOD> Depends on how I feel
<GOOD> This server is starting to feel more stagnant to me and while I'm gonna try and hold and improve the server
<GOOD> Idrk how to finish that sentence
<GOOD> Korewa
<GOOD> Marcel why isn't he blue
<GOOD> This is a grave mistake
<GOOD> Louie: EEEEYIKES! Where did that sneak bomb go!? I need to protect' my 'dandoriums'!
Oatchi walking up to his onion:
<GOOD> I'm trying to think of anything vaguely feline
<GOOD> What kind of blast are you gonna fire from that
<GOOD> The shitty rotoscoping over dragonball really makes this gif
<GOOD> Torkoal bros on top
<GOOD> Idk which Pikmin is my favourite so far with 2 entries  left to play
<GOOD> I'm inclined to say 4 tho considering all the postgame stuff
<GOOD> 3 and Hey
<GOOD> You can't beat Bloom
<GOOD> And like
<GOOD> I already play it and it's not great
<GOOD> All I've heard about 3 from people is that the motion controls saved their marriage, erased their debt and cured world hunger or something
<GOOD> My expectations for these motion controls are through the roof
<GOOD> I'm also glad to have another entry without autolock
<GOOD> But not as glad to have an entry without the cool thing 4 does where it caps your throwing for a second when you throw the right amount of pikmin
<GOOD> Ting Lu is awesome
<GOOD> I wanna read Uzamaki by Ito now
<GOOD> Gyo was so good
<GOOD> I love scorching sands until I try to ever use it and I never burn the opponent
<GOOD> And it hits like a pool noodle
<GOOD> Anyway gn it's 1am
<GOOD> More Dandori tomorrow
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> I have become a Dandori sage
<GOOD> Headache
<GOOD> I need to build the last structure and do the Louie quests
<GOOD> I'm missing 1 structure in the whole game
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> Haiiiii
<GOOD> This is a yo kai watch character you can't convince me otherwise
<GOOD> So stressful
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Drawing is hard
<GOOD> Talking to PVK about this hack is cool
<GOOD> And the spriters
<GOOD> I've been following it for months
<GOOD> I need to play it when I'm back at uni
<GOOD> She's v friendly
<GOOD> She helped teach me a bit of Welsh
<GOOD> I wanna use almost exclusively new mons tbh
<GOOD> I wanna use mostly beta mons tbh
<GOOD> Like that Pinsir one
<GOOD> Ugh the sprites are so goooood
<GOOD> I might also want that robot dude
<GOOD> And the beetle
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> It's unfortunate that PVK wouldn't ever do a gen 2 hack
<GOOD> But her adding a battle facility (apparently) is cool af
<GOOD> I'm unsure if they coded this in Assembly tbh
<GOOD> Or if they used a different method
<GOOD> They didn't expand the pokemon limit for this one tbf
<GOOD> They just cut the baby mons which is based
<GOOD> So does Zubat have a 4 stage line?
<GOOD> Wait Magnemite has a prevo?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is Magnetite just 2 Magnemite
<GOOD> How hungry...
<GOOD> I don't remember them saying that
<GOOD> Idk tho
<GOOD> I want ppl to make a real cart of it tbh
<GOOD> PVK doesn't endorse it obviously but it would be cool
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I can throw down on the modded showdown client too raaaagh
<GOOD> Mewtwo after Lickilicky in Ubers connects a single attack
<GOOD> Lickitung is so close to being broken already with the moves it has in RBY
<GOOD> Lickilicky has SD STAB Hyper Beam and body slam + good coverage off good stats
<GOOD> Probably but thanks for sharing Cell eating Android with his tail gif
<GOOD> Also has wrap Probably
<GOOD> All Ubers mons
<GOOD> Kanto expansion pak yeah
<GOOD> Didn't expect Pory 2 in Ubers
<GOOD> My GOAT
<GOOD> The awesome sprites
<GOOD> SD, STAB Hyper Beam and Body Slam, Wrap and the regular RBY normal type coverage
<GOOD> I have no idea where the monkey is from btw
<GOOD> I've never seen it before
<GOOD> And its tiering in KEP is new
<GOOD> And it's the only mon in New
<GOOD> Fanboying over Porygon 2 rn
<GOOD> I love it so much
<GOOD> They are both in Ubers and it's funny to say that
<GOOD> Very suprised that Melm isn't Ubers
<GOOD> Yeah but it has like a billion attack lmao
<GOOD> Ngl KEP UU sounds more fun than OU
<GOOD> Oh my fucking god lmao
<GOOD> I love how wonky they look
<GOOD> Also this isn't all the UU mons but this lineup looks cool
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> Tauros hyper beam
<GOOD> They also added my NB GOAT Nidoreign
<GOOD> Me after going for my 3rd Twave into the paralysed Gengar
<GOOD> I forgot how ass Wugtrio is
<GOOD> Oh my god this sprite
<GOOD> I love how they made the Slowbro tail a pokemon
<GOOD> It isn't gen 5 OU yet
<GOOD> Banned from LC
<GOOD> Creature
<GOOD> Lost media found!?!?!
<GOOD> FUCK YEAH NIDOREIIIIIGN
<GOOD> Does anyone know about Splatoon
<GOOD> It's hard to find out what inklings eat
<GOOD> Like I can't draw them making juice
<GOOD> I did do some yesterday but I've been busy on Pikmin instead
<GOOD> No more pikmin 2 for a while
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Horrible
<GOOD> 0 death Pileated Snagret is hell
<GOOD> You don't have to get every treasure
<GOOD> Just deathless
<GOOD> So some of these (only a handful) don't have every treasure
<GOOD> The only prerequisite is that you finish with 0 deaths
<GOOD> I never have to play pikmin 2 again
<GOOD> It's satisfying
<GOOD> It is goofy
<GOOD> That's funny as fuck why are their eyes so high in the 2nd row
<GOOD> I wish he made that face after losing in dandori
<GOOD> Why are they so funny
<GOOD> Smiling Olimar is cursed
<GOOD> Also the bedroom eyes 3rd image
<GOOD> Matthew Patthew has died
<GOOD> Haiiii
<GOOD> I wonder how hard it is to 100% pikmin 3 deluxe
<GOOD> I also wonder if I've done everything I can in pik 1 minus the challenge mofe
<GOOD> Mode
<GOOD> That doesn't sound believable after playing 4
<GOOD> Doesn't have the lock on tho
<GOOD> So hopefully the gyro feels good so I can learn to use it
<GOOD> Challenge mode sounds fun
<GOOD> Also is ultra spicy mode something you can pick immediately
<GOOD> Bitter spray
<GOOD> Pikmin 2 is everything dies to 20 purples being thrown
<GOOD> Jk I never used purples
<GOOD> 30 REDS!?
<GOOD> I heard rocks are the broken ones in 3
<GOOD> It goes reds purples rock ice in series order
<GOOD> That's like saying bulbmin are the best ones in 2
<GOOD> They're busted They're meant to be
<GOOD> They limit your availability to them so you don't break the game in half
<GOOD> I never ended up using any
<GOOD> Plus it's still only in caves
<GOOD> Dandori battles are inside caves
<GOOD> That's why they are usable there
<GOOD> I will take that surgery also
<GOOD> I'm not tall I would just be shorter
<GOOD> Easy, remove 1 of your feet
<GOOD> Shrink ray pew pew
<GOOD> Me flexing my knee toes
<GOOD> I think that surgery also has significant health risks
<GOOD> Like the metal rod one
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> I didn't get to look at all the clothes I wanted
<GOOD> I got some tho
<GOOD> In a vit
<GOOD> Bit
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> I went shopping but didn't get to look at most of what I wanted because it was in the women's section :((
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> In a bit
<GOOD> And my mom just took me to the men's section so I tried and found a few ok things
<GOOD> Ugh my hair looks awful
<GOOD> I don't know what it is tbh
<GOOD> It doesn't have a hood
<GOOD> I just like it
<GOOD> The first one?
<GOOD> Yeah I wanted to look at long coats and different trousers but yk, they were in the girl section so my mom steered me away
<GOOD> Was a shame because I found a really cool long puffy coat
<GOOD> And oversized cardigans and trench coats and everything
<GOOD> These should be ok tho, especially for 20
<GOOD> Idk what other trousers to look at
<GOOD> It's messy :((
<GOOD> Yeah but that was just ew and greasy and yucky
<GOOD> So I took a bath
<GOOD> I should get contacts
<GOOD> I'm just afraid of touching my eyes constantly
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I don't speak for transfems ofc but I wear some stuff I don't like too
<GOOD> This me rn
<GOOD> Let's fight spoon
<GOOD> I am they/them
<GOOD> Also yeah I do this often
<GOOD> I don't think I'll ever try E
<GOOD> Me huffing Estrogen (idk how you take it)
<GOOD> Isn't there a patch
<GOOD> Oh wait that's nicotine
<GOOD> Can I smoke Estrogen
<GOOD> Eat the cigarette
<GOOD> I just said I was gonna eat it instead smh
<GOOD> Scroll up
<GOOD> Never
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> It seems like an amazing hack
<GOOD> My dad refuses to use self checkout at the supermarket or pay using his card lmao
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure the first one is just because he thinks the workers need more work
<GOOD> The only thing I agree with old people on is digital menus
<GOOD> Because they seem rlly pointless
<GOOD> Well exclusively digital menus
<GOOD> That's relatively understandable tbh
<GOOD> I mean my dad is only 40 and thinks supermarket chains are gonna steal his credit card details and commit fraud
<GOOD> He also only tops up his Xbox wallet with cards
<GOOD> Like, the ones you buy that give codes
<GOOD> Because he doesn't trust Xbox either
<GOOD> Going to the gaming cafe to sell my organs
<GOOD> My dad did that too but now it's just like
<GOOD> Who cares, if I die I die lmao
<GOOD> Hasn't happened yet
<GOOD> If it does I'll let you know
<GOOD> I just couldn't
<GOOD> If I went to someone's house it had to be planned like weeks in advance
<GOOD> I've never had that
<GOOD> I'm glad my uni's gaming club has been alr for that
<GOOD> I've made a few friends that I talk to there, one is trans but we just make WOKE liberal agenda jokes while playing Mario Kart so
<GOOD> That sounds about right
<GOOD> My local cafe has one of those generic machines but it has a ton of games and runs well so idm
<GOOD> I wouldn't expect them to buy a HTTF arcade cabinet lmao
<GOOD> They also have a Wii and a PS3 which is fun for Warioware
<GOOD> I have 1 irl close friend
<GOOD> I love D&D
<GOOD> I am now on season 3 episode 5 of Better Call Saul
<GOOD> Surely this episode will not stand out in any fashion
<GOOD> It's Chicanery
<GOOD> Hooooly shit
<GOOD> You think this is bad?
<GOOD> This? This chicanery?
<GOOD> HE DEFECATED THROUGH A SUNROOF
<GOOD> Idk I never liked how Dorkly looks even with high quality
<GOOD> The movement just doesn't mesh with the things moving
<GOOD> It reminds me of some death battle animations
<GOOD> Dumb ppl
<GOOD> Hazbin hotel
<GOOD> I wonder why
<GOOD> This could never be because she spent all of it on hiring famous people
<GOOD> Nyan neko sugar girls
<GOOD> Character design if it was written by Vivziepop
<GOOD> Well at least she wasn't racist against
Freddy Fazbear
<GOOD> Also I'm sending this here now as well
<GOOD> This is the only sonic prime media I've ever seen btw
<GOOD> Secret base is now Retro base...
<GOOD> Sorry marcel
<GOOD> I love how little cohesion there is in the scene
<GOOD> It's just a soup of assets
<GOOD> I need to see the other one
<GOOD> If Chaos, then only Emeralds!
<GOOD> Is this to do with that card we saw the other week
<GOOD> Jail
<GOOD> Jail
<GOOD> I can't believe I finally got here
<GOOD> I genuinely couldn't take the scene seriously
<GOOD> Also the whole scene felt like an Ace Attorney thing so that also helped
<GOOD> Chuck when I turn a light on near him
<GOOD> It's an uncomfortably long scene
<GOOD> Like I like Better Call Saul but some scenes are so fucking long
<GOOD> There's a few scenes where literally nothing is said and nothing happens
<GOOD> Like, there's multiple minutes of Mike going to get food and then moving his chair to face a window and then he sits down and eats food
<GOOD> And like 10 minutes of Mike taking apart a car that literally leads to nothing
<GOOD> And no words are spoken during the scenes
<GOOD> Dude it shows him just taking apart a car in excruciating detail looking for a tracker
<GOOD> And then it just doesn't go anywhere because he doesn't find it until after the car is dismantled
<GOOD> And the scene where he takes apart a tracker that is also completely silent
<GOOD> Or where he goes to shoot someone but then he just lies in the dirt silently for multiple minutes then leaves
<GOOD> I just realised a lot of Mike's scenes are silent
<GOOD> Like 0 dialogue
<GOOD> There's also a scene where Saul tracks some guy, follows him into a restaurant to watch him and he literally just sits there orders food and then eats it in its entirety, and sees nothing out of the ordinary
<GOOD> And that's the scene
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Game theory making a theory about Chuck's allergy is so funny
<GOOD> Chuck's allergy is all in his mind well no shit
<GOOD> That's what like half of the show is about
<GOOD> Idk what Alan Wake is about but I hope it's that
<GOOD> No it's about some old dude that's allergic to electricity
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> Good day
<GOOD> It's the sequel to Smite 1 hope this helps
<GOOD> Also if you want a real reason It's probably new engine
<GOOD> I haven't played Smite in a while tho
<GOOD> Hopefully they remodel alllll of the crusty ones
<GOOD> But still allow classic skins
<GOOD> Hello chat
<GOOD> I am smitten and idk what to do about it
<GOOD> I have a crush
<GOOD> I just like the word smitten
<GOOD> I doubt it, my sensors for whether this person is attracted to me at all is completely broken
<GOOD> So I'm gonna leave it a while
<GOOD> If a friend likes hugs and likes me sleeping on them and wants me to be more physically affectionate with them but says she loves affection from her bestie (me) is that signals or just being a rlly good friend
<GOOD> My brain is fried
<GOOD> I literally don't know
<GOOD> I should mention that by sleeping on I mean like, leaning and hugging her while sleeping
<GOOD> Idk she's pretty up front
<GOOD> I am afraid rn yes
<GOOD> I'll try
<GOOD> Maybe it's just because I've never had platonic intimacy that isn't just like, hugging my parents or whatever
<GOOD> Things becoming awkward
<GOOD> I'll work from there
<GOOD> No it would become awkward if she thought I thought it was going that way
<GOOD> Yeah but asking is already meaning I think that way
<GOOD> I've GYATT to finish this gunpla kit!!!
<GOOD> Smite 2 looks good
<GOOD> I need to link my PS account to my PC
<GOOD> Getting into warhammer a bit but is this that faction of biological weapons
<GOOD> I forget their names
<GOOD> Tyranids
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Oooo
<GOOD> Me apologising for messaging my friend too much then being unable to not message her too much
<GOOD> (She is perfectly fine with it I just can't not apologise)
<GOOD> Every 2 to 3 hours or so I'll send a few messages about some random thing
<GOOD> Like how I'm feeling or what I've been up to
<GOOD> Or literally something completely out of the blue
<GOOD> She doesn't respond so it looks like a lot
<GOOD> I have decided to try sailor moon
<GOOD> I saw
<GOOD> I want
<GOOD> Today we Dandori, tomorrow we practice Dandori, and the day after we Dandori more
<GOOD> I think the issue was that apparently the transphobia was presented as a result of his autism which is like
<GOOD> Problematic at best
<GOOD> I don't like my voice ffs
<GOOD> It's too gravelly and annoying
<GOOD> I just don't like it
<GOOD> Idk the thing is I don't want fem voice training I just want a less masc one
<GOOD> Lumi after achieving complete women
<GOOD> Buy money on amazon
<GOOD> Erm why does the exchange system exist, I can just exchange money for more money???
<GOOD> This is an infinite money glitch
<GOOD> Nah just exchange for a lot of a very not valuable currency, then exchange it back at a 1:1 ratio
<GOOD> Venezuala dolar
<GOOD> 1
<GOOD> The unpleasant gradient appears
<GOOD> Why are Krillin and Trunks' punches missing Cell in this scene? Are they blind?
<GOOD> The actual reason is just that it isn't affecting him
<GOOD> I just like shitposting
<GOOD> He can't taunt either I think Cell is blind also
<GOOD> Like who is he punching at here?
<GOOD> Is he hallucinating?
<GOOD> Super Hero Pan
<GOOD> Also I have watched 2 episodes of Sailor Moon and the fights have been awesome
<GOOD> So like first she's like I can't do it
And then she throws her crown at them and they die instantly
<GOOD> I've only watched 2 episodes
<GOOD> I really hope the episodes do not all end with her just immediately killing the threat
<GOOD> I mean I like her character
<GOOD> She's funny because she fucking sucks in school and in general
<GOOD> I like the pink
<GOOD> I wonder if Usagi feels guilt for murdering people as the first option
<GOOD> I haven't seen her actually attempt to do anything else other than immediately turn them into ash baby jpeg 5 seconds after they meet
<GOOD> It looks awesome tbg
<GOOD> Thh
<GOOD> Like is she just a psychopath that feels no empathy for killing ppl
<GOOD> I know they're like demons but like
<GOOD> Surely disintegrating someone would make you feel a little guilty
<GOOD> Games
<GOOD> She's like Goku if he wasn't fucking around on Namek or smth
<GOOD> Like 0 damn mercy
<GOOD> First episode she cried which caused an earthquake or something then she immediately turned someone to dust
<GOOD> Every time someone says something like that my head is flooded with Nah, I'd win
<GOOD> I just learned that one of my favourite DB characters' most iconic attack never even happens in the anime
<GOOD> I need a minute
<GOOD> Why did they give Gogeta a move in a game that looks almost identical to the one in the anime but make it different and also the most iconic one
<GOOD> Like what
<GOOD> This never happens in the show
<GOOD> I mean he just went for the same attack again
<GOOD> I don't know why he didn't just fire the fucking attack instead of whatever the ki wave thing was
<GOOD> Also spends most of his fusion time doing close up magic
<GOOD> That's what I mean by game exclusive tho
<GOOD> 100x Big Bang Kamehameha never happens
<GOOD> It's so odd
<GOOD> He has the confetti attack it makes it worth it
<GOOD> Peak
<GOOD> I still don't know how he did that
<GOOD> Like he just manifested a party popper
<GOOD> He shouldn't know how to do that is Whis watching this
<GOOD> Is the supreme kai seeing this shit Gogeta 4 is magic
<GOOD> Omega Shenron after Gogeta pretends to remove his thumb
<GOOD> I think Gogeta 4 had the funniest fusion time wasting in the series
<GOOD> And there's a lot of competition
<GOOD> Isn't ion just a word
<GOOD> In a gen where the story is based on power
<GOOD> Triangle strategy trying to not be Octopath Traveler 1.5 in my mind:
<GOOD> I hate that I ugly laughed at it
<GOOD> My brain is so fucked man
<GOOD> Like cackling etc
<GOOD> When you just can't control yourself and your laugh sounds awful
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> It's been like 2 days and I'm already bad mentally
<GOOD> Playing Sam and Max hit the road
<GOOD> It's already funny af
<GOOD> Nuh uh
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Oh?
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> Getting demoted for saying you are old
<GOOD> Okie
<GOOD> I haven't left bed today except to get food
<GOOD> I've felt like such shit mentally the last few days
<GOOD> I love sam and max
<GOOD> They're awesome
<GOOD> I'm bad at point and click tho
<GOOD> I mean patience + reasoning
<GOOD> Or just patience because some old point and clicks are so cryptic
<GOOD> Also can we just agree the despicable me theme has no right going as hard as it does
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Despicable me was released 13 years ago
<GOOD> The last time I committed to watching a bunch of movies ended with Multiverse of Madness
<GOOD> Now I just watch them every few months
<GOOD> I'm havin a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrollin whatever I see
Ugh, Despicable Me
<GOOD> At least you aren't 
Freddy Fazbear
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> I mostly watch FNAF stuff as background audio
<GOOD> Doodling
<GOOD> I also added a shell to their back
<GOOD> Idk what else they would have
<GOOD> Maybe make their body more bulky?
<GOOD> I hear you queer my fellow secret base member I hear you like finding slash commands and talking about final fantasy my fellow secret base member
<GOOD> Just use queer tbf
<GOOD> It's a helpful word
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> It sounds like it's still offensive but like, very affirming
<GOOD> And inclusive
<GOOD> What reclaiming insensitivity does to a mf
<GOOD> Hey baby, lemme make it clear my fellow queer, I think we should get together ya hear?
<GOOD> How do you think this would work with my crush
<GOOD> She has told me she is pan so I have a chance
<GOOD> We can bond over women
<GOOD> This is the official changelog for Sam and Max Save the World remastered lmao
<GOOD> I love this series already
<GOOD> You better have driving and shooting when I get there
My gaming ass:
<GOOD> Bobobo is awesome
<GOOD> We're running out of people
<GOOD> Eventually content will cease to exist
<GOOD> I don't think feet is the issue
<GOOD> I think that hey aren't you that guy that harassed someone for foot RP is the issue for him
<GOOD> As gross as it is it makes it stick in the public eye because people like memeing the shit out of creeps
<GOOD> Fair enough but this also isn't that because Pyro didn't harass anyone, nothing criminal will come of it but in the public eye he's cooked
<GOOD> And he defused those allegations, if Chuggaconroy can also prove he didn't harass someone then fair to him
<GOOD> As I said, weird shit like this sticks
<GOOD> Welp imma wait and see
<GOOD> But it's unfortunate to see this happen
<GOOD> I've never watched him but whatever
<GOOD> That image lives rent free in my head it's so funny
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure he's owning it nkw
<GOOD> He made a joke about it a few weeks back
<GOOD> Yeah he posted this
<GOOD> Good on him
<GOOD> For bouncing bacj
<GOOD> Back
<GOOD> Also I just saw the BT Yamcha video again and it keeps making me laugh
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It worked for Goku
<GOOD> I haven't played a BT game
<GOOD> I wish One Piece had good games
<GOOD> We only have Pirate Warriors and Burning Blood which are both mildly fun but not amazing
<GOOD> And the one 3ds arcsys game
<GOOD> But that doesn't really
<GOOD> Count
<GOOD> He's so whimsical
<GOOD> I love his stupid fucking bouncing animation
<GOOD> They have used it in both his game appearances so far
<GOOD> The caption
<GOOD> I love that image
<GOOD> So apparently you can capture, butcher and sell humans in Palworld
<GOOD> I mean it seems funny
<GOOD> And apparently humans are ass statwise
<GOOD> Sam and Max is a hard game
<GOOD> I need a cork or something and I can't find one
<GOOD> I got Wario gold mine ultra shortcut
<GOOD> I feel awesome
<GOOD> THIS IS A REAL PALWORLD CREATURE!?
<GOOD> This is literally just Goodra and Meganium dude
<GOOD> I used a free costa code but they didn't tell me how big Large was
<GOOD> Holy fuck lmao
<GOOD> Like my hand is average sized
<GOOD> It's hot chocolate
<GOOD> I like coffee but prefer hot chocolate
<GOOD> Then I'm gonna try a new hobby store
<GOOD> But I'm nervous
<GOOD> Yeah like warhammer and model kits and stuff
<GOOD> I've had pretty nerve wracking and awkward experiences in some before
<GOOD> Yah but it rarely goes well
<GOOD> Last time the dude literally followed me around the store
<GOOD> Like just walking behind me and talking about allllll the products
<GOOD> And then I felt pressured into buying some paint so I bought a pot and left
<GOOD> It's apparently warhammer mainly so I hope they don't trap me on that because I don't know much about it
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> I walked past on the way here and they were bantering
<GOOD> So I hope it goes ok
<GOOD> Yeah but even if I say what I'm there for they're gonna tell me stuff I mostly already know and it's aaa
<GOOD> Probably gunpla or just scouting out for later
<GOOD> Installing this when I get home
<GOOD> Bear5
<GOOD> This was made before Bear5 was a thing
<GOOD> I have no idea why they made it
<GOOD> Someone just woke up and was like what if Withered Freddy was blue
<GOOD> I haven't played any
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Actually I've played FNAF 1 and 4 on 3DS
<GOOD> I shaved today so I feel awesome
<GOOD> I have my oversized jumper too
<GOOD> I bought a 11 model
<GOOD> Which isn't too expensive and I actually wanted it so
<GOOD> Great start
<GOOD> I wish I could just like, astral project to a store and look at the stock
<GOOD> Ig
<GOOD> They have a lot of warhammer idk if the prices are good
<GOOD> The kits had good prices
<GOOD> I'm tired of feeling lonely
<GOOD> New main acquired
<GOOD> Level 9s are so stressful to fight
<GOOD> I saw Palworld was like ark and immediately lost interest
<GOOD> If I liked Ark, I would probably play Ark
<GOOD> But I don't like Ark so I don't think Ark but worse would be very appealing
<GOOD> Yea it looks too been there done that
<GOOD> That's not exactly irregular
<GOOD> Anyone have any FNAF fangame recommendations
<GOOD> Same but I'm trying to narrow it down
<GOOD> I don't wanna play FNAC rlly
<GOOD> Flumpty's could be fun
<GOOD> I love looking at basic best FNAF fangame lists
<GOOD> Because they're like holy shit Jolly 1 is so peak
<GOOD> Guys I should play FNAC 2 it's so fun
<GOOD> Mid
<GOOD> Oh I know about Tyke and Son's, just didn't consider it
<GOOD> I should get that and FNAF Bloody Nights
<GOOD> Popgoes 1 is iffy
<GOOD> I forget if there are others
<GOOD> Wait
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> I mixed up Jolly 1 and Popgoes 1
<GOOD> The mechanics at least
<GOOD> Jolly 1 is the one with the wires right
<GOOD> Where you just spend the entire time repairing wires
<GOOD> ~~Post shift 2~~
<GOOD> I AM reading allat
<GOOD> Minater Freddy
<GOOD> Oh shit right
<GOOD> I hope my PC can run these
<GOOD> 8GB recommended for bite at Freddy's
<GOOD> Lucky Me
<GOOD> Night 1 of Bite at Freddy's is already so stressful lmao
<GOOD> I died to a misconception but I'm ok
<GOOD> This is hard af
<GOOD> I'm only on course 2
<GOOD> All 3 are active on course 2
<GOOD> Yrs
<GOOD> Wait, only 3 nights?
<GOOD> I know but I'm on the 3rd course
<GOOD> Not the 3rd order
<GOOD> Meaning I'm on the 3rd course and apparently that means foxy is active
<GOOD> Also ugh I didn't know Foxy didn't get closer to that vent
<GOOD> Foxy feels so hard tho
<GOOD> It's like dealing with 8 animatronics
<GOOD> Yeah but I'm not on night 1
<GOOD> I'm on Course 3
<GOOD> You aren't understanding
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> They are called Courses
<GOOD> I am on Course 3, meaning that Foxy, Freddy, Bonnie and Chica are all active
<GOOD> Which means about 6 different cameras to manage
<GOOD> As well as 2 or 3 office things
<GOOD> I had issues with him going to a vent
<GOOD> Because it didn't look like he was there yet
<GOOD> And I don't think he showed up on the conveyor
<GOOD> Unless he moves absurdly fast
<GOOD> What sound cue
<GOOD> Why would I do that
<GOOD> It takes significantly less time to close the door on them
<GOOD> Cute
<GOOD> Unfortunately vent usually seems to mean death
<GOOD> Because the power load is incredibly strict
<GOOD> Bonnie is probably the biggest issue by far
<GOOD> I know but it's spotting him in the first place
<GOOD> Since he can appear in 3 different places and I'm managing the 5 vent cams and 3 other animatronics that have 2 functions each
<GOOD> Sending order 2
<GOOD> I thought there was like 4 orders this night
<GOOD> That's not good
<GOOD> I rlly doubt I can do another night after this
<GOOD> Without it taking an absurd amount of tries
<GOOD> Because if they're even a little more aggressive I'm not gonna be able to keep track
<GOOD> I mean AI levels increase across nights anyway
<GOOD> So night 4 is gonna be awful if this is night 3
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> Oh course 3 was the last ond
<GOOD> That makes sense
<GOOD> Oh nvm final course
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> FIRSTVTRY
<GOOD> I overloaded literally right at the end
<GOOD> That was a good af fangame
<GOOD> Ughhhh
<GOOD> I spent about 10 minutes on 1 basket hunt and didn't get it
<GOOD> I just said that
<GOOD> And I doubt it if I suck this bad
<GOOD> No fuck off w that, custom nights are just
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> They just aren't interesting
<GOOD> It was 4 nights
<GOOD> Finding the baskets was genuinely just too hard
<GOOD> I got to order 4 but literally spent 10 minutes looking for 1 basket then lost
<GOOD> Oh damn
<GOOD> No one told me Digimon were so cool
<GOOD> I've only watched 1 series of Digimon and it was pretty good
<GOOD> Its grey forms look cool
<GOOD> Fusion
<GOOD> I watched it as a kid
<GOOD> And a little bit of original series I think?
<GOOD> It was just called digimon fusion
<GOOD> I remember Shoutmon was the protagonist digimon if that helps
<GOOD> I remember a digimon that was like a ferret scarf thing
<GOOD> Or was that a different series
<GOOD> I could have sworn that was digimon
<GOOD> Nvm I found it
<GOOD> I think it was this
<GOOD> I heard Cyber Sleuth is great
<GOOD> How long is this
<GOOD> Also is it just called Digimon Tamers
<GOOD> Not too bad
<GOOD> Why is that dude on the right yellow tho
<GOOD> Are they ill?
<GOOD> Girl on the left got the trim that looks like bowtie pasta
<GOOD> I've seen that big eared digimon a few times tbf
<GOOD> I only remember Agumon, Gaumon, Greymon an-
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I feel stupid now
<GOOD> The far left one
<GOOD> A lot of digimon seem to like guns
<GOOD> This goes absurdly hard
<GOOD> I remember this dude a lot
<GOOD> From the series I watched
<GOOD> Apparently his name is Tactimon and Lord Bagra is someone else
<GOOD> I forgot Apparently
<GOOD> You have no idea how funny I find this
<GOOD> They turned the comments off too
<GOOD> From my understanding he likes feet and someone tried to get him cancelled for that after she told him it was fine to do
<GOOD> So like in the end who cares
<GOOD> It just seems really fucking strange
<GOOD> I'm pissed at like 2 other pointless discourses rn I'll let Chugga handle this bc I'm fairly sure he already apologised
<GOOD> Plus like I don't know the dude
<GOOD> *3 other pointless discourses
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> Mentally tired
<GOOD> The apology was like, alright
<GOOD> I just explained why
<GOOD> Fairly by the numbers but he seems sorry so
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> Apologies where people actually apologise are immediately like B tier
<GOOD> He didn't apologise for that
<GOOD> And tbf he didn't need to
<GOOD> Used to be a transphobe
<GOOD> Or at least that's what the apology is about
<GOOD> He did clarify what the apology was for tho
<GOOD> *the video
<GOOD> Not the apology
<GOOD> Fuck I'm fried
<GOOD> It's very by the numbers but not bad
<GOOD> This year has been dogshit so far
<GOOD> I hate it
<GOOD> I love my mom
<GOOD> This feels like one of those videos you pitch down to have great king of evil Ganondorf tilt at Sonic
<GOOD> Super Metroid review clears
<GOOD> That's a concerning amount of ref
<GOOD> Red
<GOOD> Does that mean teachers get to hit kids
<GOOD> Hello chat
<GOOD> I told my friend all of my worries about her and my self esteem and she completely put them all down
<GOOD> I feel awesome
<GOOD> She put them down as in killed them off
<GOOD> Put them to rest
<GOOD> Basically told me she will never drop me as a friend
<GOOD> She basically sat me down and told me to tell my brain to fuck off while forcefully being like you ARE my friend I DO like you
<GOOD> Apparently they got an experienced guy in to help but he only knew Unreal, so they had to scrap the entire Unity build of the game and start over
<GOOD> With the guy teaching them Unreal
<GOOD> You can't make this up
<GOOD> It's very Nintendo hire this man coded
<GOOD> Yeah bro they made the BotW killer too
<GOOD> Can't come up with an idea for a full roster of unique designs
<GOOD> The fucking ear ripping chime is so funny
<GOOD> Why is it so loud
<GOOD> It sounds like that notification meme with the skeleton
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Your character's brow protrudes so far that it casts a shadow
<GOOD> Literal sexual harassment in this case
<GOOD> The fact that they made this pokemon entry number 69 because some random twitter dude suggested it tells me a fair amount
<GOOD> It feels like a concept Elon Musk would come up with
<GOOD> What is that, a tree?
<GOOD> Bro why are Digimon so cool
<GOOD> I really wanna get into it
<GOOD> I watched Fusion and a bit of the original
<GOOD> As a kid
<GOOD> Dude the first and main selling point of the game was pokemon but violent and guns
<GOOD> I think they ran out fairly early
<GOOD> Someone asked their 13 year old kid why they quit pokemon and were like eureka
<GOOD> Nono, they want to be different from pokemon apparently
<GOOD> They've gone on record saying it lmao
<GOOD> Worst entry ever btw
<GOOD> I don't think Palworld understands the pokemon philosophy of having random accidental implied weird shit
<GOOD> Best selling game on steam or smth apparently btw
<GOOD> Or like, it broke some record
<GOOD> Most concurrent players maybe
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I'm reaaaaally sad to see that this is the opening of the gates
<GOOD> I expected it but it's happening
<GOOD> Tbf I don't think it'll keep going
<GOOD> It'll balloon then pop
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> They make abandonware
<GOOD> Highest all time peak is so concerning
<GOOD> Why is it so expensive too
<GOOD> Like this is an alpha early access unity asset flip why does it have so much traction
<GOOD> Would it help to know about the AI game or did you already hear
<GOOD> Also cr1tikal is gassing up this game apparently because ofc lmao
<GOOD> I don't think people understand that this game selling well isn't threatening pokemon in any way
<GOOD> Presumably while palworld 1 is still in early access
<GOOD> The craftopia mobs are so funny bc like
<GOOD> You could have made them look like anything else
<GOOD> Buying peak...
<GOOD> Why is their face so devious
<GOOD> When money
<GOOD> I need to beat Sam and Max first
<GOOD> Also idk Popgoes Arcade isn't that appealing to me despite it having a kickass aesthetic
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> Just not an RPG person usually
<GOOD> However that Like a Dragon game looks fun af
<GOOD> That's turn based
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> PUBG evangelion cosplay saving the gaming franchise
<GOOD> It frustrates me most to see people saying it's ok to steal designs from big companies
<GOOD> Like, artists still made the designs
<GOOD> You only hurting the artists
<GOOD> They have a history of making abandonware just like this game lmao
<GOOD> It's so funny
<GOOD> Like their previous game is still being updated
<GOOD> I guess it's really true about people and games with guns and balls
<GOOD> You could buy 3 copies of Sam and Max hit the road for below the price of Palworld
<GOOD> This is the society we live in
<GOOD> Is it alarmist to say this is like a rlly critical point in gaming as a whole
<GOOD> And it's failing
<GOOD> Like this could warp a lot of indie games forever
<GOOD> Being told to my face that stealing from artists is ok is like
<GOOD> Rlly deflating as an artist
<GOOD> And I don't even do that shit for money
<GOOD> I feel like if I worked for a commission I'd be cooked rn
<GOOD> And everyone is talking about legality and how it's legally ok to do so like
<GOOD> Dude did you forget morals exist or what
<GOOD> At least that one died off
<GOOD> This one has proven it's successful to plagiarise and make slop for moolah
<GOOD> Which is true of pokemon but at least they don't steal shit
<GOOD> (If I see the dragon quest image one more time)
<GOOD> I'm gonna get on a high ledge istg
<GOOD> Pikmin...
<GOOD> You said Goolix right
<GOOD> Marcel did you see this interview
<GOOD> Teehee
<GOOD> I'm gonna stop talking about palworld because it's genuinely almost been my breaking point to quit the mod team and leave the server
<GOOD> I don't know what that is
<GOOD> I have a DST account to link to my PC too
<GOOD> Unfortunately for palworld I'm not gonna have a sexual harassment lizard be my breaking point
<GOOD> Salazzle if she was writt-
<GOOD> Also I saw my first actual helluva boss songs and oh my god
<GOOD> One had like a really clashy harmony for some reason
<GOOD> And the other was someone singing about NSFW or smth so I didn't listen
<GOOD> Whatever Viv writes
<GOOD> Give me a sec
<GOOD> Wrapping my head around it
<GOOD> I can't find that one gif of the spongebob people
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> I like drawing things I'm looking for
<GOOD> It's funny
<GOOD> Is that where Kommo'o is also based on
<GOOD> Or at least their naming
<GOOD> My Pikmin folder is filling up yay
<GOOD> I wanna do that art trend of I think we're gonna have to kill this guy with your 2 comfort characters but I only have 1
<GOOD> Not how it works
<GOOD> Olimar is like a rlly special character to me
<GOOD> I don't have another like it yet
<GOOD> I wonder what the comments will be
<GOOD> Surely it won't be that one fucking gif
<GOOD> At least you can create more content of them
<GOOD> It could be worse tbf
<GOOD> Olimar is the protagonist at least
<GOOD> At least I don't have Shacho as my comfort character
<GOOD> Yea but it's not dependent on other ppl
<GOOD> Like I have to wait for Nintendo to make more Pikmin content
<GOOD> Honestly sam and max have pretty big potential to become a comfort character rn
<GOOD> I just don't know which one I love both
<GOOD> But like surely I like one mor
<GOOD> I love them
<GOOD> I like Max's design more and he's more unhinged but Sam is a different kind of unhinged and his voice and personality are great
<GOOD> I cut our brake lines
Well I was already planning on slowing down by hitting other motorists, little buddy
<GOOD> I love them
<GOOD> Point and click game by lucasarts that became a franchise and cartoon
<GOOD> That alsp
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> They're just rlly fucking unhinged
<GOOD> Like, it may seem like Sam is the voice of reason but he really isn't
<GOOD> They beat up a liquor store owner at the start of the game for no reason
<GOOD> This intro makes me laugh idk why
<GOOD> (Skip most of the opening credits part after the first intro)
<GOOD> The first introduction to them just being hello after they accidentally stumble onto the scene is so funny to me
<GOOD> Also around 4 minutes the intro starts
<GOOD> Like the post opening credit intro
<GOOD> Where should I put this bomb so it doesn't hurt anyone we love or care about?
Out the window Sam, there's nothing but strangers out there
<GOOD> I genuinely think this game is gonna break me mentally what do you mean people were gassing up this game and it got any attention before its release
<GOOD> Gaslit by pocketpair inc
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Good
<GOOD> They also forgot the beads on  the hair not realising it looks dogshit when you do that
<GOOD> Yeah but it also looks like rlly bad when you take them out
<GOOD> Also this is the most Nintendo hire this man game I've ever seen
<GOOD> It's finally here
<GOOD> I love bringing this video out
<GOOD> They hired this man...
<GOOD> Idk where it is
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Doodling a fakemon
<GOOD> I think imma call it Dreadsnort
<GOOD> Hmmm I wonder if there was any possibility the people gassing up this game had no clue what they're talking about
<GOOD> How could this have possibly blown up in their faces
<GOOD> It's fairly obvious they stole now
<GOOD> But like they're still trying to be entirely different from pokemon or whatever
<GOOD> That's the cope other ppl have been using
<GOOD> Like oh they just HAPPEN to look like pokemon *dragon quest image*
<GOOD> They caused someone criticising Palworld to recieve death threats so
<GOOD> I really shouldn't have opened a thread about enby people
<GOOD> Apparently masc NB people are a lot smaller in the NB umbrella that I thought
<GOOD> Also I had never seen the apparent large quantity of posts from people like glad I'm AFAB enby idk what I'd do if I was AMAB like :/
<GOOD> I think I've been sobered a bit
<GOOD> It's just a bit rough to realise that people see NB ppl as mostly just fem apparently
<GOOD> I wasn't aware this was a thing
<GOOD> It's just annoying to see the women lite thing get thrown around
<GOOD> I know it isn't true but idk
<GOOD> There's something amiss rn
<GOOD> The slurs don't feel nearly as bad as this
<GOOD> Yea it's taken me months to get in an ok spot
<GOOD> I'm not fem but I'm leaning less and less masc
<GOOD> At least I'm starting to be happy w my hair
<GOOD> Thank you
<GOOD> I think I need to look into skincare for my face
<GOOD> Currently it's a bit rough and marked because I had breakouts up to a year or so ago
<GOOD> Yea ik
<GOOD> I'm just naturally drifting that way
<GOOD> I don't necessarily wanna be fem, but I do wanna be fairly androgynous
<GOOD> Just a teensy bit masc leaning ig
<GOOD> Nah I don't rlly get them anymore, it's just red splotches from when I did
<GOOD> ~~And a bit of dead skin issue I should rlly buy exfoliation stuff~~
<GOOD> Rn I have a bit of a uni issue but when that's sorted I'll look into expanding a bit of my self care stuff
<GOOD> That's only bc the uni thing is fairly urgent
<GOOD> I don't rlly want E, it's something I've thought about a bit and might consider again in future but like
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Same goes
<GOOD> I still have a bit of a built in stigma around messing with my hormones and I don't know why, I'm worried about health issues ig
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah no thanks then
<GOOD> I'm good
<GOOD> I'm already frail and sickly
<GOOD> I may consider it eventually
<GOOD> Oh dear
<GOOD> I hate needles
<GOOD> But as I said I'll consider it I'm not gonna jump in bc of smth I can fix with skincare maybe
<GOOD> Thank you to everyone here for talking to me about something that should have beem blatant already
<GOOD> Apologies for being a bit slow to the punch on realising shitty stuff happening and I'm glad I could talk about it
<GOOD> I should sleep I have to be up in 6 hours for a 6 hour uni day
<GOOD> Stick shift skull bad to the bone
<GOOD> Need this with a harder skeleton image
<GOOD> And the word anxiety in flames
<GOOD> Splitting myself up like Exodia and giving parts to different relatives
<GOOD> Get this man a redbubble
<GOOD> Ooooo
<GOOD> Pre
<GOOD> Pretty
<GOOD> Dying at basic a level chem rn
<GOOD> What the fuck is an orbital
<GOOD> I get the cloud thing I was just struggling on notation
<GOOD> I understand now
<GOOD> I rlly should learn a fighting game
<GOOD> Oh that's people defending whatever this is
<GOOD> People are defending this game's existence
<GOOD> And saying MrBeast was never good or whatever the fuck
<GOOD> This is hell
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> He signed a deal with Amazon that was probably already in motion months ago and this makes him a zionist and nullifies absolutely everything else he ever did
<GOOD> So ppl are basically just bandwagoning and saying that he's never done good
<GOOD> Oh I'm aware but people have so much vitriol towards pokemon that people are defending this game too
<GOOD> Tbf it's succeeding because it's a blatant ripoff
<GOOD> People want to stick it to big corporations without knowing what they're doing ig
<GOOD> 2 hours of MGS and I quit
<GOOD> Dude it's so frustrating
<GOOD> Metal Gear Solid
<GOOD> I spent forever in a boss fight, then a bunch of bullshit happened consecutively ending with me entering an area and immediately exploding then getting forced into a boss fight
<GOOD> Tank
<GOOD> Oh you mean the first boss
<GOOD> Revolver Ocelot because the aiming is ass
<GOOD> I didn't get the call until I started moving in the area
<GOOD> And by the time I moved I stepped on a landmine
<GOOD> And then I fought the boss like twice, realised throwing grenades is like rlly bad and stopped
<GOOD> Because I didn't know how to not get immediately blown up and then spend a minute circling around a tank missing grenades before dying
<GOOD> As much as I propogate the discussion when it comes up, same
<GOOD> Was there even a gimmick to his boss because like I never found it out
<GOOD> Yea I don't get why ppl have to justify buying slop
<GOOD> I bought Jump Force deluxe edition on release for 80
<GOOD> And ngl I got my money's worth
<GOOD> To this day the most expensive game I've ever bought
<GOOD> If we're talking total it's Smite for me
<GOOD> Definitely
<GOOD> I spent 50 on 1 event once because it was insane value
<GOOD> I don't actually regret that one
<GOOD> It gave me 40 skins that were probably gonna be like 5 a pop anyway
<GOOD> As well as a skin that had the model, animation and effect efforts of developing a whole new god
<GOOD> And free gems etcetc
<GOOD> Decent value if you rlly like Smite
<GOOD> I need to draw them on my drawing tablet
<GOOD> Ok Metal Gear Solid is awesome I was completely wrong
<GOOD> I beat Psycho Mantis
<GOOD> I almost quit at the first and second bosses
<GOOD> Actually the Ninja has been my favourite fight so far
<GOOD> Or at least equal with Mantis
<GOOD> I'm taking a break for the night but I think I'm getting close to the wmd
<GOOD> End
<GOOD> Can we have another, larger wall
<GOOD> And then trap everyone in this chat within those walls
<GOOD> Connection terminated
<GOOD> May be permanent
<GOOD> I will say SwSh looks good in every area except wild
<GOOD> Yea p much
<GOOD> Did you not hear what I said or are you just saying something different
<GOOD> I can't tell
<GOOD> Ok ig
<GOOD> I'm bored of the blah blah Pokemon lazy crap anyway
<GOOD> Idk what colour to make my OC
<GOOD> I've already heard it for years and years and years lmao
<GOOD> Idk what to actually spend money on tbh
<GOOD> I'll probably just keep saving
<GOOD> I still really couldn't care less
<GOOD> Beating a dead horse doesn't kill it again
<GOOD> Already own it
<GOOD> Tbf it's not like Pokemon ever slowed down with too many games
<GOOD> Ever
<GOOD> Like literally never there are so many pokemon games
<GOOD> Talking ab spinoffs too
<GOOD> Also they had 3rd games up until gen 5
<GOOD> Still more
<GOOD> I assume something to do with Sun Wukong
<GOOD> NEW FNAF GAME!?
<GOOD> It's an Into the Pit game, surely the fandom will take this well
<GOOD> The trailer looks great
<GOOD> Someone is building fucking springlocks and then wearing them
<GOOD> I'm dying
<GOOD> Spoontrap
<GOOD> Also Spoon
<GOOD> I have a MGS question
<GOOD> Does the Ninja's slow walk phase require chaff or do I just suck
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> Kinda mid
<GOOD> Wbu
<GOOD> God this looks cool
<GOOD> I fw this Springtrap
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It looks cool but the new Springtrap's body looks odd
<GOOD> More or less
<GOOD> I've never read it but I sorta get it
<GOOD> Then I used 9 chaff grenades for nothing
<GOOD> Tbf I have barely used them so
<GOOD> I loved the fight tho
<GOOD> Minus some fucky hitboxes on the kicks
<GOOD> I rlly don't think that Nintendo will ever care about this game
<GOOD> Like if it doesn't flame out, it won't be a competitor
<GOOD> Them saying that just opens them up to not being parody
<GOOD> Genetically engineered hit indie game
<GOOD> RETROTRAP IS CANON
<GOOD> GRAAAAAHHHHHH
<GOOD> NUMBER 1 CRATE
<GOOD> Is that a croquet mallet
<GOOD> Springbonnie is a high society fellow
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> We hear him in SL
<GOOD> Pittrap raaaaa
<GOOD> Playing Olimar at my local gaming society
<GOOD> So Olimar
<GOOD> At the local gaming society
<GOOD> Purple F smash...
<GOOD> Guys, hot take but Sonic had a rough transition into 3D and kissed a human!,!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!
<GOOD> the curse
<GOOD> Mario cannot ride horses anymore
<GOOD> The brainrot has spread
<GOOD> The 2 mario sports final fantasy crossover games went crazy
<GOOD> The only sonic games I had on DS were rush and the turn based RPG
<GOOD> What if it was Wario tho
<GOOD> Why does pittrap look like this
<GOOD> William GYATTon
<GOOD> First recorded springlock failure
<GOOD> I have almost finished MGS
<GOOD> I will finish it tomorrow
<GOOD> It seems today
<GOOD> That all you see
<GOOD> Is violence in
<GOOD> Using a sniper rifle in MGS was so janky wtf
<GOOD> I wonder how much of it is intentional
<GOOD> It's 11pm here
<GOOD> Still losing it over this image
<GOOD> How did they prove this was non canon
<GOOD> Furthermore what effect would the canonicity of Bingo Battle have on Pikmin lore
<GOOD> I wonder if Pikmin 2 challenge mode is canon
<GOOD> Louie always does that
<GOOD> Well Pikmin are in Mario
<GOOD> Don't know about Kirby and Mario
<GOOD> Samus herself also appears in SMRPG
<GOOD> Also what why does Samus' airship appear in DKC lmao
<GOOD> But yea through the magic of easter eggs all of them exist together
<GOOD> Unless you somehow think Mario Golf isn't canon
<GOOD> I'm honestly inclined to believe Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games is canon
<GOOD> Death for killing 36 people doesn't
<GOOD> This was the incident with the studio that made Dragonmaid/Nichijou right
<GOOD> Or was that a different thing
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Also Palworld has officially made the big time
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> Says a fair amount how this has literally never been suspect to investigation with any other monster catcher beforehand
<GOOD> Yeah but the ppl saying oh they didn't infringe on anything these designs are wholly unique and now TPC are looking into copyright infringement lmao
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> It's also pogaming, other games and secret base because of yours truly
<GOOD> Mfs defending Asmongold now???
<GOOD> This tool
<GOOD> Oh boy this image
<GOOD> Big corporation vs small indie devs means that indie devs are always in the right
<GOOD> Also small indie devs vs smaller indie devs apparently
<GOOD> It's crazy how people completely discredited the model argument that one time because they said they scaled the models and have no idea what that means
<GOOD> Yeah but apparently changing the size of a model is simply too much and is obvious rigging of the argument
<GOOD> Anyway yeah why are people defending Asmongold for being the biggest consoomer possible
<GOOD> He literally makes a living profiting off other people's art
<GOOD> I feel so cynical after all this bullshit
<GOOD> I rlly shouldn't have bothered making art
<GOOD> I feel like people also forget that art doesn't have to just be drawing
<GOOD> Like seeing games as a product first is kinda :/
<GOOD> It's everything
<GOOD> People will defend that art doesn't matter, and that legality is morality, and that everything against a big company will inherently be good despite not understanding that artists work for companies
<GOOD> It just feels so pointless
<GOOD> Like what am I gonna gain by creating art if people think of art as a product first
<GOOD> Hell I don't even wanna gain from art
<GOOD> I just wanna create it without being told my hobby is pointless because a robot makes better art as if that's a thing
<GOOD> That enjoyment is drained when sharing your art leads to nothing but being told your art is shitty and invalid
<GOOD> It's anything, all art I share is met with indifference or obnoxiousness
<GOOD> I really should, but it feels like admitting that nobody actually cares about it
<GOOD> Like if I create art and can't share it because I think I'm gonna get shit on for it not being good art, it feels horribly cynical
<GOOD> And at the same time it's exactly correct
<GOOD> Wait, people say this game isn't political?
<GOOD> How the fuck is metal gear not political
<GOOD> Oh sniper wolf is not fucking around wtf
<GOOD> FUCK YEAH
<GOOD> Aaaaa I'm so worried
<GOOD> I'm so fucked
<GOOD> Basically I may have pigeonholed myself into a hypothesis I can't prove for a project I have to do
<GOOD> Since the hypothesis is proven by data that doesn't yet exist
<GOOD> Is it just finding the data
<GOOD> Data as in results of research
<GOOD> Such as migration patterns and invasion success of a species
<GOOD> This is so funny
<GOOD> Dude this game is
<GOOD> AGH
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> The areas are so big and crowded and this is the first area
<GOOD> MGS2 is fun
<GOOD> But why is Raiden so fruity
<GOOD> I saw so many damn posts about Raiden coming from the Fortnite shit and then I get to the game and he leads by doing a backflip while fucking doves fly around him?
<GOOD> Also I did Tanker and took a break after slipping in bird shit in Plant a few times
<GOOD> Snake in MGS1 was so awkward around women I swear, I get he's meant to be suave but the dialogue felt so stilted
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> He's like if a man and a woman had a baby
<GOOD> BI BOSS!?
<GOOD> Also I haven't seen that between Snake and Otacon yet apart from like, just Otacon being awesome in 1
<GOOD> Also why is Ocelot possessed that's so random and funny
<GOOD> Ocelot fighting off the men kissing thoughts
<GOOD> Ocelot likes men too?
<GOOD> Meryl, I'm gay
What?
Meryl, I'm gay too
Is there anyone here who likes women?
<GOOD> I should buy the AA Apollo Justice trilogy
<GOOD> ~~you could say that about MGS1 with the fake chemistry Meryl and Snake have~~
<GOOD> I still haven't seen the other ending because I suck at this game
<GOOD> And I didn't submit to torture
<GOOD> Mortal Kombat is so mid ngl
<GOOD> I don't get how it's such a big franchise alongside like SF and Tekken
<GOOD> Because those games look sick
<GOOD> I wish I could play new Tekken but I'm bad at Tekken
<GOOD> I feel like it's fragile if you playing Mortal Kombat
<GOOD> It feels so comically masculine but it's just like
<GOOD> The fatalities are ok and that's it
<GOOD> A friend I used to have sweated MK and loves Terminator and Predator and Arnold and blood and gore and For Honor
<GOOD> Mortal Kombat movie...
<GOOD> Tekken 8 looks awesome
<GOOD> I've seen 1 clip from it and it's just someone loading in and the opponent is dressed like Drake
<GOOD> I'm waiting on Apollo Justice collection
<GOOD> Is the appeal just like, people exploding
<GOOD> I have played MK a fair amount and it feels very unsatisfying unless you're doing a fatality
<GOOD> I should play it then frfr
<GOOD> I suck so bad at FGs
<GOOD> Can't do inputs
<GOOD> I own that and it took me over an hour to do the tutorial
<GOOD> Like just basic attack chain-->support-->another attack
<GOOD> Ig press square then do that more
<GOOD> Janemba and all GT characters are DLC
<GOOD> Dying
<GOOD> Also is there like, content that isn't online
<GOOD> I've only done the tutorial
<GOOD> And I don't want to play online yet
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> BASE VEGETA AND GOKU ARE DLC!?
<GOOD> Spopovich DLC
<GOOD> IT'S HAPPENING
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> THESE MAPS AREN'T IN THE GAME
<GOOD> Unless they modded an existing map to have these treasures which feels pretty pointless
<GOOD> Is CDkeys a safe site to use
<GOOD> Nah I just want a Minecraft Key
<GOOD> Will I be a victim of credit card fraud
<GOOD> It is on this one
<GOOD> Just gonna take a few days to top up my paypal
<GOOD> Paypal is a precaution tbf
<GOOD> I'm just very suspicious of non-steam game sources
<GOOD> Guess who went nonverbal from a nervous/stress episode today
<GOOD> For the first time ever
<GOOD> I think I may be getting worse overall
<GOOD> That's a bit scary
<GOOD> Trying to play MGS2 but Raiden gives me gender envy
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I still can't believe they added him
<GOOD> I assume Peter would be even fatter if he was a skin
<GOOD> And this skin is already huge
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> Mew literally just exists and that's its story
<GOOD> Not rlly
<GOOD> Yes, it exists
<GOOD> Having a power is not a story
<GOOD> Yea, and it exists
<GOOD> That's not like a story
<GOOD> Like if I say I'm a shoemaker, that's not a story
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Pecharunt story clears
<GOOD> Is this not the case for every mythical
<GOOD> Who would tell that story no one knew about Pecharunt
<GOOD> Their lore is dropped in about 1 minute of dialogue
<GOOD> Because mythicals just kinda exist
<GOOD> And they made the biggest one yet for Pecharunt
<GOOD> Usually they're reduced to 1 scene or 1 battle
<GOOD> Arceus is literally 1 staircase, no?
<GOOD> That isn't a mythical event..
<GOOD> Also Arceus is only in it for a bit and he barely actually gets anything added
<GOOD> We already knew everything about Arceus that we were given in PLA
<GOOD> 1 cutscene and a staircase
<GOOD> Yeah maybe in 15 years we'll get a Pecharunt game that adds absolutely nothing and restates what we already knew
<GOOD> That would be so peak
<GOOD> Also PLA is a gen 8 game
<GOOD> It does have a whole story tho
<GOOD> That's what they did for Arceus!!!
<GOOD> It's ok
<GOOD> Also we've known this mythical has existed for 2 weeks
<GOOD> Surely Pokemon would release more Pecharunt content based on datamined shit
<GOOD> Pokemon revealed Pecharunt 2 weeks ago and we've already gotten more lore (THAT ISN'T RESTATING THE 2 PIECES OF LORE IT HAS) than any mythical
<GOOD> Arceus is genuinely so vanilla as a mythical that in its own game it got overshadowed since all it did was create shit and then fight you
<GOOD> >one of 1000 hands
>made shit
>doesn't like Giratina
<GOOD> That is literally Arceus' lore
<GOOD> It has always been that
<GOOD> It existed, it made shit, the one we know is probably some projection
<GOOD> Missed out the pact stuff, its origin, the fact they robbed some dude
<GOOD> The islands in gen 3 kinda mid
<GOOD> He kinda is tho
<GOOD> The gen 4 event is literally that he just decided to bully some child
<GOOD> Wasn't he just in a haunted house in gen 5
<GOOD> It's never been shown that much
<GOOD> Cresselia can purify whatever the fuck Darkrai does but they've never been at odds
<GOOD> Played PMD, do spinoffs now count as gospel
<GOOD> Because like, in Ranger Darkrai is pure fucking evil for no reason
<GOOD> He just starts consuming shit and killing people
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> If I clog my drain and buy drain cleaner, the shit in my drain and the drain cleaner aren't enemies
<GOOD> Like Darkrai kinda just does shit and Cresselia does shit and sometimes purifies whatever Darkrai is up to
<GOOD> Since they're living things wouldn't Cresselia do it herself then-
<GOOD> Rather than just coexisting
<GOOD> If they hated each other they'd probably interact
<GOOD> The assistance of Cresselia's wing
<GOOD> Being able to stop what Darkrai does doesn't mean she does do so
<GOOD> Pokmon company also says otherwise
<GOOD> Considering they have been portrayed as allies in the anime
<GOOD> Spinoff Darkrai is tweaking or smth
<GOOD> Genuinely have no clue why he's so evil in the spinoffs
<GOOD> Like he does that shit in Pokepark too
<GOOD> Because he's not been shown to be especially malicious in the games
<GOOD> If he was then he'd probably be blowing shit up and putting whole towns to sleep to siphon off their life
<GOOD> Do you think people in the pokemon world noticed Dark Void nerfs
<GOOD> Better than nuking them with a shadow ball
<GOOD> If it was actually malicious they'd probably just put them to sleep and eat them
<GOOD> It's possible it needs to feed off dreams or whatever
<GOOD> And main series games
<GOOD> I would call indifference cordial
<GOOD> I haven't done my laundry yet so I'm wearing these pajamas that say gamers never sleep all over them
<GOOD> I wish I wasn't wearing them
<GOOD> Tf going on in America
<GOOD> Government transcript
<GOOD> Oooo
<GOOD> Fancy
<GOOD> Believe me there are worse
<GOOD> Realising how many carbs I eat
<GOOD> My meal for tonight is sweetcorn, pasta, breaded chicken and a small mildly stale bun
<GOOD> I gotta start burning it off
<GOOD> Not quite as skinny rn
<GOOD> I should continue in Chrono Trigger
<GOOD> But I have so many games to play and irl things to do
<GOOD> This Miku horror trend is so damn cool
<GOOD> I should get into Miku
<GOOD> I meant like her game
<GOOD> My favorite is Waterpon
<GOOD> Yea but her music is p good
<GOOD> I just like Waterpon bc it's adorable
<GOOD> This Miku trend is so damn cooooool
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> One is just a bear creepypasta, one is that peaceful drive video, one is the Ring and one is scary maze
<GOOD> The bear creepypasta is just oooo evil scary bear
<GOOD> And a mildly unsettling bear
<GOOD> More beef in the flat that I'm not involved in
<GOOD> Feeling this rn
<GOOD> I'm not good at fighting games which is the issue
<GOOD> Yea but the initial curve to actually allow you to play the game is steep
<GOOD> My motor skills seem pretty dogshit
<GOOD> I struggle partly with even FighterZ
<GOOD> Especially the long ass 70% combos
<GOOD> Like I can't chain shit together
<GOOD> I still do not understand that
<GOOD> Like that's even more advanced than what I'm thinking about
<GOOD> I understand what neutral is
<GOOD> I don't understand how it works in traditional fighting games
<GOOD> I know how disadvantage and advantage works from smash
<GOOD> But what you described with Sol just went right through my skull
<GOOD> What would be safe on block
<GOOD> Fast moves with low amounts of recovery frames?
<GOOD> Or moves that push you a sufficient distance away to be in your effective range
<GOOD> Does this mean Sol Badguy just gets to throw this move out safely from neutral
<GOOD> Ok so in neutral I throw my big dumb safe attacks
<GOOD> So it circles back around to doing wild unpredictable shit in neutral
<GOOD> Because I'm ngl I'm really good at making the stupidest decisions possible
<GOOD> That is a half second free window wtf
<GOOD> I literally always do that but tbh my default is to lead with the worst possible opener because no one is stupid enough to think I'd do it
<GOOD> This is where I struggle
<GOOD> Because usually it ends with me just getting my shit pushed in for a million years before the combo drops
<GOOD> Yeah but don't those attacks still come out fast
<GOOD> Is standing block always able to block aerials
<GOOD> So throwing a mid as a starter out of neutral is usually bad?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I feel like if I got Strive I would start on May
<GOOD> Because I was heavily advised to not start with Potemkin
<GOOD> I know about wakeup I think
<GOOD> I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself
<GOOD> It's starting to not make sense anymore
<GOOD> The only comparable thing I can think of is ledge in Smash
<GOOD> Why would you stand up, is it punishable to whiff a wakeup attack
<GOOD> Is there a strive character that has the euphoria I felt earlier landing big dumb Kazuya punches
<GOOD> Big dumb as in the impact
<GOOD> I like characters that have oomph
<GOOD> Doesn't matter if they're good, they have to feeeeel good
<GOOD> Why does it exist
<GOOD> But that seems like a very strong pressure tool
<GOOD> +11 even if the pressure doesn't actually work?
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> So is that the big dumb move I throw out on neutral
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Why is he a badguy
<GOOD> I wanted to try both Nagoryuki and Pot but I was told they can't move forward for shit
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ngl I think of the whole roster May still looks the most appealing
<GOOD> Big anchor + dolphin
<GOOD> Holy shit I literally don't care about any of the things in her avoid section
<GOOD> Hell I literally prefer simple openers to mix ups
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I have switched to whole wheat pasta in an attempt to be more healthy
<GOOD> Idk what else to change about my diet except eating less and not having snacks
<GOOD> Nah mine is brown
<GOOD> Yeah, about this raw
<GOOD> It feels like they tried to make it rhyme for no reason
<GOOD> And it doesn't even rhyme so
<GOOD> Hoooooly shit I found a small speedrunning server w good resources
<GOOD> And they're friendly
<GOOD> I may need to draw a chart
<GOOD> For this speedrun
<GOOD> Remembering is hard
<GOOD> Doing random work at midnight despite doing none all weekend
<GOOD> It's not even urgent I just felt like it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Ok so I've learned like 5 minutes of a Pikmin speedrun but haven't tried it
<GOOD> A typical run is like an hour long
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Gamecube NTSC
<GOOD> All Parts
<GOOD> Pikmin 2 speedrunners watching the ship do the announcement for the billionth time
<GOOD> Or the treasure counter
<GOOD> The tutorial day in 1 can be over in like 3 minutes
<GOOD> If not less
<GOOD> You just grow pikmin, push a box, grow more pikmin and carry the thing back
<GOOD> Same but like, replaying Pikmin 2 sounds awful I'm ngl
<GOOD> Unless I'm not paying attention and can mash through dialogue
<GOOD> God this route is hard to remember
<GOOD> 2nd area of the game and 1st proper area and I am *struggling*
<GOOD> Oh shit that was 2 years ago
<GOOD> I don't have a friend group
<GOOD> I have friends, not a friend group
<GOOD> You are my friend, you don't interact with my other friends, you are incompatible friends and therefore it's not a friend group
<GOOD> I *did* have a friend group, but I ruined both of them
<GOOD> Well 1 may have been because I was gaslit into believing I was the problem and tanking my mental health-
<GOOD> And then the second one I was genuinely the problem because I came off the tail end of that last friend group
<GOOD> They never end up staying long
<GOOD> They join that funny graveyard image like they're martyrs for being bigoted
<GOOD> Mh, it's getting harder and harder to believe this server is fixable
<GOOD> Yea the great filter catches everyone
<GOOD> I wasn't here pre pandemic
<GOOD> I wish I could name characters
<GOOD> Yea but I'm always poor w names
<GOOD> My OC is named nothing because I can't think of a name
<GOOD> Oh damn these pimin tricks seem hard
<GOOD> You need to use the c stick and A button at the same time which is quite annoying
<GOOD> Like what finger does what
<GOOD> So far the tricks I know are directional dismissing, deloading, c stick throw and long throw
<GOOD> It's a stock image I assume bluetooth
<GOOD> Unless they chopped it off
<GOOD> I think they did but if not there's unlicensed ones
<GOOD> For Pikmin it's perfect
<GOOD> Unless you prefer New Play Controls which I haven't fully tried
<GOOD> It's also p good for Melee
<GOOD> For Melee it is
<GOOD> The notches are v helpful, the c stick has less distance to travel for inputs, the bumper is rlly sensitive
<GOOD> Just saying no proves nothing
<GOOD> Then why bring it up
<GOOD> Oh also the buttons are more central and easier to press
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> The face buttons are closer to one another
<GOOD> And yet the face buttons on GC usually feel better based on what they're assigned to
<GOOD> Having the A button be so large on a GC controller with the whistle being slightly off to the side is so helpful for Pikmin
<GOOD> As well as C stick trumpet
<GOOD> Don't need em
<GOOD> With your thumb pushing the c stick it's rlly easy to use the face buttons
<GOOD> Yea because I'm used to the Switch controls
<GOOD> Which kinda suck because they're halfway between new play gyro and no gyro
<GOOD> And without gyro they're worse than GC controls
<GOOD> Believe me I know Pikmin
<GOOD> I even have a conspiracy that the gamecube controller was made for it
<GOOD> Also just realised with a pinching motion you can c stick throw fairly easily with practice
<GOOD> Very helpful
<GOOD> The bumpers are so frail
<GOOD> Canada twitter account learns how seeing works
<GOOD> Yeah but they aren't actually blue is just false
<GOOD> I am aware of this
<GOOD> But the method by which it's blue doesn't matter bc it's blue
<GOOD> Being an optical illusion does not make it not blue
<GOOD> I understand how it works, I simply am saying it is still blue
<GOOD> Yum
<GOOD> I love this trend
<GOOD> Ik I keep saying it
<GOOD> Mimiku
<GOOD> I didn't even realise that was found in 2023
<GOOD> It was lost media till then
<GOOD> I stopped watching him ages ago because he scared me as a kid
<GOOD> King Kong: Story Mode
<GOOD> Sobbing
<GOOD> Fuck you mean JRPG dialogue THAT'S FROM CHARLES DICKENS
<GOOD> I'm watching a Ghibli movie in a cinema later this week
<GOOD> Boy and the Heron
<GOOD> Probably sub because apparently both dub and sub are stellar
<GOOD> I've never watched Ghibli in a theatre before
<GOOD> I know nothing about it except apparently it's an allegory for Miyazaki disapproving of his son yet again
<GOOD> Mochi
<GOOD> This lesson is terrible
<GOOD> Talking about how much of my diet can fuck me over despite me trying not to
<GOOD> They don't give alternatives
<GOOD> Just things that are less shitty
<GOOD> Aaaa I hate talking about healthcare
<GOOD> And disease
<GOOD> Talking about aneurysms is terrifying
<GOOD> Spopovich...
<GOOD> They should buff Spop then
<GOOD> Perhaps to his initial.state
<GOOD> Devs making a whole ass Goku Black future
<GOOD> I love facing my own mortality
<GOOD> It's only 11am bro
<GOOD> I'm on 6 hours of sleep I'm not gonna ponder the concept I could be struck at any moment in my life
<GOOD> I still can never tell if this is true or not
<GOOD> I feel like I'm being gaslit
<GOOD> Yea but I'm in a lesson telling me how awesome and common coronaries are before explaining a heart attack in excruciating detail
<GOOD> As well as aneurysm
<GOOD> And thrombosis
<GOOD> And this was after 2 hours of telling us that what we eat increases this massively
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I've switched to whole wheat pasta and wheat shreddies but there's still too many carbs in my diet
<GOOD> And chicken is healthy but not healthy enough
<GOOD> Especially when I'm lazy and buy processed
<GOOD> I might just cut coffee or biscuits out of my diet altogether if I can
<GOOD> I eat like, shredded wheat in milk for breakfast w some coffee, a frozen chicken burger in a white bun for dinner, and usually like pasta and chicken for tea
<GOOD> I also buy frozen wedges or smth that I use but I really shouldn't
<GOOD> Oh and cucumber or steamed broccoli w the pasta
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Then what do I do lmao
<GOOD> I can't not have milk unless I want cereal in water
<GOOD> Well ofc I should
<GOOD> Coffee is bad for you
<GOOD> And I can't rlly justify having snacks
<GOOD> And I accidentally bought frosted shreddies this week so I feel bad
<GOOD> But covered in sugar
<GOOD> Possible new doodle idea
<GOOD> I love Beerus!!!
<GOOD> Mine is this dog what noe
<GOOD> My teacher was talking about fats and she mentioned the golden arches and I thought she meant heaven
<GOOD> I brush well enough
<GOOD> I don't think even a nail through my skull would put me off sugar
<GOOD> Curse of binding
<GOOD> I haven't had braces
<GOOD> I have 2 large front teeth I hate tho
<GOOD> Which is awesome
<GOOD> I wanna be able to look at things without my intrusive thoughts making me think uncomfortable shit
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> How would I
<GOOD> And no I haven't considered
<GOOD> Don't have a GP here
<GOOD> Probably the same, I just haven't found a practice here yet
<GOOD> Wonder why
<GOOD> I don't understand what neuralink like
<GOOD> Phone....
<GOOD> I keep thinking of that stupid phone = bad animation
<GOOD> First result lmao
<GOOD> Why did God make Noah put 2 of every fish on the ark? Is he stupid?
<GOOD> How did Noah get 2 each of the millions of insect species
<GOOD> My honest reaction
<GOOD> Me in 2024 as the only cishet person left............. the WOKE killed everyone else
<GOOD> (Jk the WOKE got to me I'm not cis)
<GOOD> Who would win
<GOOD> Famously apolitical movie Godzilla crushes the woke I fear
<GOOD> Bringing my goat back
<GOOD> Very sugoi
<GOOD> Wasn't it because the Mario VA had their pronouns in bio
<GOOD> Idek if they're queer
<GOOD> Shigeru WiyaWOKEo...
<GOOD> Nintendo has fallen
<GOOD> That's the confusion I had
<GOOD> I thought the Mario VA was NB
<GOOD> I misremembered
<GOOD> Idk how to voice train but I will learn to sound like Perfect Cell
<GOOD> (Definitely what it's for)
<GOOD> Or Beerus so I could say this
<GOOD> Probably the closest voice I could get ngl
<GOOD> My voice is too deep for Frieza
<GOOD> It's also not nasally enough
<GOOD> Me when a group of people sit directly behind me in a room with ample seating and then talk in a low voice that isn't actually low and super loud the whole lecture
<GOOD> It's fuckin awesome when people never shut up that's so cool
<GOOD> Thank you Sakurai
<GOOD> Tbf I'm not gonna give into the FOMO
<GOOD> I doubt the price of keys for the game will spike
<GOOD> Well there's always piracy
<GOOD> So yippe
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I don't think people really wanna talk about DC rn lmao
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> But it's genuinely that bad it seems
<GOOD> Also it's WOKE game (it has a pride flag in it)
<GOOD> So not even the woke triggered crowd wants the game
<GOOD> No angry bald men
<GOOD> The sonic leaks are so funny
<GOOD> They made a shit game and killed their game universe
<GOOD> Batmanarkham has actually banned talk about the game lmao
<GOOD> Sent to the Aslume
<GOOD> Oh nvm they can't filter out all the posts
<GOOD> I've seen a concerning amount of evidence that disproves that statement
<GOOD> Things never change
<GOOD> No, this is face. Are you stupid????? (I have to legally disclose this is a reference and not an insult)
<GOOD> Just found out this sub exists
<GOOD> Why would I insult users, am I trying to get removed from the mod team?
<GOOD> I'm not mod, I'm Man
<GOOD> Why is Man trying to get ears, is he Batman?
<GOOD> Nah, I'd Man.
<GOOD> Why did Man not Man the Man Man for Man? Man Man Man?
<GOOD> Why is Man's head so big? Is he smart?
<GOOD> #secret_aslume
<GOOD> I just made that character, what the fuck should I call him
<GOOD> That isn't Man, are you plagiarising?
<GOOD> What if it was this gif
<GOOD> I'm ngl I think I could do a good Liquid Snake impression if I tried
<GOOD> Caved and bought Strive half off
<GOOD> Must be antibodies left over from the April Fools Outbreak last year
<GOOD> We don't take it away
<GOOD> It's commemorative
<GOOD> Ok so is it bad I can sense a juicy move when I see it
<GOOD> If Spider, then only man!
<GOOD> I love this post
<GOOD> This is becoming an unhealthy Digimon addiction
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> This guilty gear game kinda fun
<GOOD> Holy shit this game is hard
<GOOD> I'm trying to learn dash cancels and oml
<GOOD> These tutorials
<GOOD> Dash cancel, the romans weren't that bad in the tutorials
<GOOD> I didn't understand the timing of dash cancel
<GOOD> You have to leave it super late to actually have the attack come out before queuing up the next one
<GOOD> Also I was learning combos and made the mistake of picking May not realising she has to queue up her dolphin input an attack in advance
<GOOD> Also apparently I'm suprisingly good at fast dragon fist inputs
<GOOD> This game fucking sucks tbh
<GOOD> GGS
<GOOD> I'm on 3 star tutorials and I already can't complete it
<GOOD> Tutorials
<GOOD> My thumb hurts so much
<GOOD> It's barely even halfway
<GOOD> What else am I meant to ddo
<GOOD> The controls feel stiff as fuck
<GOOD> If I use the D pad for accuracy it injures my hand and sucks ass
<GOOD> And if I use the stick I misinput constantly
<GOOD> Sounds easy
<GOOD> But isn't
<GOOD> 8bitdo pro 2
<GOOD> It has a plastic D pad with grooves on it
<GOOD> I'm not throwing myself online without knowing a single bit of the game
<GOOD> I can't even combo
<GOOD> Like I can do the most basic ones when they are directly in front of me on the screen
<GOOD> Can't do that either
<GOOD> Don't start
<GOOD> Please
<GOOD> I have been playing for 4 hours
<GOOD> All on tutorial
<GOOD> 3 of which on 1 tutorial
<GOOD> *1 of which
<GOOD> Not 3
<GOOD> This is a fundamental
<GOOD> It was right next to hey, escape corner
<GOOD> Doesn't help that May requires the most painful input possible to fire off horizontal dolphin mid combo
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> So you usually have to queue up the back input mid combo, 1 attack before totsugeki comes out
<GOOD> >mid combo
<GOOD> It does not stand
<GOOD> Yea but the combo they taught was down-back to forward + Y
<GOOD> Which is a horrid feeling movement to do
<GOOD> Literally the combo they are trying to teach me rn does
<GOOD> It feels unintentional and clunky
<GOOD> Why would I super into a sweep
<GOOD> A sweep has the least vulnerable frames of all of the moves I've seen so far
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Like yeah let's make you go from sweep input to do semicircle back to forward + a different button because fuck you
<GOOD> Otherwise the game would let me do that
<GOOD> D pad
<GOOD> The stick makes me misinput constantly
<GOOD> I have tried using the joystick in every fighting game I've played
<GOOD> Also they
<GOOD> It always has the same issue
<GOOD> Me, I'm they
<GOOD> How about I put a lead pipe through my skull
<GOOD> That sounds preferable rn
<GOOD> I did the same input on joystick and it was too sensitive and I kept double jumping
<GOOD> People keep talking about the rhythm of the moves but like
<GOOD> They just feel wrong
<GOOD> Especially when that rhythm has to already be in motion over a second before it arrives
<GOOD> I literally can't fucking play them because I'm dogshit
<GOOD> It really doesn't feel like it considering the best answer I've found to random input eating is to frantically mash the input until it goes through
<GOOD> And that was genuinely the solution that was consistent
<GOOD> I know roman cancel
<GOOD> It's not that hard to understand I just can't actually use it
<GOOD> Because I can't combo
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> It feels pointless outside of one though
<GOOD> At least for Red Roman
<GOOD> Blue Roman I guarantee I wouldn't be able to capitalise on
<GOOD> I forgot yellow roman and purple seems genuinely useful
<GOOD> Is yellow the one that recovers input lag
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I haven't actually played the fucking game yet
<GOOD> Because I can't actually apply anything I leaened
<GOOD> In a vacuum it's fine but like
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> And I've forgotten shit from the start of the tutorial like jump cancels
<GOOD> Always goes like this ffs
<GOOD> Try to learn the game, it's too hard
Play the PvE, it's bullshit and burns me out or runs out
Play the PvP, get absolutely creamed by sweats online
<GOOD> Expecting a 3 hit combo to work after an hour and a half sounds reasonable
<GOOD> Why do you think Pikmin is my favourite game series of all time
<GOOD> It blends the micromanagement and simplicity with potentially genius application
<GOOD> And it isn't boring because I'm not sitting at a table like man these dudes dying
<GOOD> I can handle competition if I'm actually doing ok
<GOOD> And I can't fucking do ok
<GOOD> Because this is the case with every game
<GOOD> Any game
<GOOD> Including single player
<GOOD> I am bad at quite literally
<GOOD> Every game
<GOOD> It is true
<GOOD> And they are when I am doing ok at them
<GOOD> And not being completely eradicated or having my time wasted
<GOOD> But I can't learn
<GOOD> Like I genuinely cannot learn from mistakes
<GOOD> Do you not think I've tried to adapt in a game ever
<GOOD> I have the exact same habits through my entire playtime with a game
<GOOD> I fall for the exact same things every time
<GOOD> Already trying to
<GOOD> Can't memorise it
<GOOD> My memory is absolutely shit
<GOOD> Well only one way out of that ig lmao
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> That game is fun
<GOOD> I never bothered S ranking anything tho
<GOOD> What is a tower
<GOOD> No, I'm laying in bed trying to stay safe physically
<GOOD> I'm not gonna lie to you in the headspace I'm in rn the only way that would end is with me in unsafe conditions in my  bathroom
<GOOD> So I'm lying in bed and staying here
<GOOD> Why ask btw
<GOOD> I guess spoilers for the sonic game
<GOOD> We already know who shadow is
<GOOD> He's that red hedgehog guy
<GOOD> My head is splitting
<GOOD> Same for offline for me
<GOOD> I bought frozen scampi bites for later this week
<GOOD> Trying to eat healthier
<GOOD> And I think scampi may be healthier than chicken
<GOOD> Happy birth
<GOOD> Oh also Spoon just so you know I am uninjured
<GOOD> And unlikely to be injured tonight
<GOOD> At least by myself not being a dumbass
<GOOD> I've been buying reduced store smoothies but I rlly should get a blender
<GOOD> I don't deserve my irl bestie
<GOOD> I've been eating so much fibre tbf
<GOOD> Shreddies for breakfastz whole wheat pasta
<GOOD> I really need a blender
<GOOD> Remote heartburn
<GOOD> I could probably handle that ngl
<GOOD> Mayyyybe 1 level below
<GOOD> Oh Nando's?
<GOOD> Medium may as well be baby food lmao
<GOOD> My flatmates are horrible with spice, they call the lowest tier at Nando's spicy
<GOOD> Like the light herbs or whatever
<GOOD> Waffle fries peak
<GOOD> I have a craving for proper roast potatoes rn
<GOOD> Drooling
<GOOD> I miss the chips of my home
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> You can also ask the chippy for a bag of the batters sometimes
<GOOD> Very yummy
<GOOD> Dude you're making my heart acge
<GOOD> Ache
<GOOD> Genuinely Dudley Zoo was always the big day out for my family
<GOOD> And I never rlly stopped going
<GOOD> Ignore that I'm casually doxxing myself kinda
<GOOD> But I miss home
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Smileys go hard
<GOOD> Broooooo
<GOOD> Arcade is kicking my ass
<GOOD> I GOT A DRAW!?
<GOOD> Got assigned to 6F, immediately stomped
<GOOD> Ughhhh
<GOOD> I'm getting cheesed out every fucking match
<GOOD> I can't fucking do a thing in this game
<GOOD> I am playing May, they play Happy Chaos
<GOOD> And I have no idea how to prevent just being pushed across the screen and then shoved when I get in close
<GOOD> Tbf there's a difference between competent zoning and just spamming the same move
<GOOD> Because I can't get close and they just blue roman cancel when I lay a finger on them
<GOOD> Because it's fucking boring?
<GOOD> Like holy shit bro do you zone on a fucking date too so they don't smell your stinky ass?
<GOOD> Like how am I meant to get in close
<GOOD> Difference between playing your character and labbing a combo but online because it's 1 move
<GOOD> I found 1 of those, and then when they started losing they immediately started zoning
<GOOD> If I jump I get shot, if I totsugeki I get shot
<GOOD> If I rushdown I get shot, if I slowly inch forward I get chipped and pushed back
<GOOD> Like May's rushdown options don't come out fast enough
<GOOD> Surely May has options?
<GOOD> Like if HC got nerfed surely she has an ok matchup in disadvantage against him
<GOOD> Maybe I should try a new character but like
<GOOD> May has 5 star ease of uae
<GOOD> Use
<GOOD> So any other character is just gonna be harder
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Also orange stats mean good
<GOOD> Damn there's a lot of DLC
<GOOD> Maybe I should play Potemkin
<GOOD> Happy Chaos players???
<GOOD> Absolutely
<GOOD> I just don't know May's options into him so I lose
<GOOD> Immediately
<GOOD> Because none of them actually play their character at different ranges
<GOOD> I got beaten by one
<GOOD> Played well because his hitboxes were marginally bigger than me
<GOOD> Never actually landed potbuster tho
<GOOD> He just used his giant ass attacks
<GOOD> He tried doing it out of neutral at the very beginning of the match without moving
<GOOD> I'm ngl idk who to actually try
<GOOD> May is rlly fun
<GOOD> Bedman is kinda funny
<GOOD> I haven't got them I don't think
<GOOD> Faust looks kinda silly
<GOOD> Doesn't seem like it from gameplay
<GOOD> He has so much shit going on
<GOOD> Maybe I'll try him then
<GOOD> Because while May is fun that zoner matchup is fucking dreadful
<GOOD> My friend said she wanted to go to a cafe w me today and hang out
<GOOD> I don't think she's even awake yet and it's almost 2 :/
<GOOD> Aaaaa I need to start working
<GOOD> No I'm getting started on my project
<GOOD> And it feels fucking Herculean so I'm collecting resources
<GOOD> New splatfesr
<GOOD> Saturday thh
<GOOD> Tbh
<GOOD> Eh
<GOOD> It should be balanced
<GOOD> Why the fuck would they do Spongebob lmao what
<GOOD> Ok but why would they do it now
<GOOD> What about the other 2
<GOOD> No way we arguing over ice cream flavours now
<GOOD> Like mint and chocolate are both interchangeably known ice cream flavours
<GOOD> Not rlly
<GOOD> I don't like mint
<GOOD> I'm just saying it's one of *the* ice cream flavours
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> I haven't played MGS2 properly yet what does that even mean
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> So peak
<GOOD> This is heat
<GOOD> Cross pollos Hermanos
<GOOD> Gus plays for the company team
<GOOD> Also holy fuck reading these papers
<GOOD> Everything is kinda coming together but I can't help but feel something is missing
<GOOD> Perfect
<GOOD> My friend hasn't been online at all today after promising we'd hang out today yesterday
<GOOD> I skipped dinner just so we could eat out somewhere
<GOOD> Oh well ig
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> So my friend was just busy ig
<GOOD> I'm way more upset than I should be ngl
<GOOD> YOU DIDN'T TELL ME FAUST WAS FUCKING AWESOME
<GOOD> HE'S SO COOL
<GOOD> I love his design his moves his combos feel good
<GOOD> Everything
<GOOD> I can consistently do a 50% combo against the wwll
<GOOD> His thrust attack is so hilarious
<GOOD> The golf combo
<GOOD> Babe I'm coming home, you better not be unnecessarily hard image of Faust when I get back
Me:
<GOOD> They also said they wanted to cut filler of Aang doing silly shit
<GOOD> ~~doesn't Final Fantasy/Square do this kinda shit too~~
<GOOD> I thought they had 0 comeuppance for saying they were aggressively gonna use AI images this year
<GOOD> Apart from mild twitter discourse
<GOOD> It's not like they're going under or anything tho
<GOOD> Also for what it's worth, Poppy did drop the NFT shit p fast and now they're getting better and better
<GOOD> Chapter 3 imo is probably better than current Security Breach + Ruin
<GOOD> Chapter 2 was ok and prob better than 1
<GOOD> 3 is phenomenal
<GOOD> I think the upscaling drama in the FNAF community recently is interesting
<GOOD> Not FNAF itself
<GOOD> This ransomware creepypasta used images like this to create a surreal dreamy effect using dalle2, since it's notoriously shitty at it
<GOOD> So they used the official renders and then filled in parts with upscaling
<GOOD> It literally released like yesterday
<GOOD> But ye they used images like this
<GOOD> Oh wait someone made that based on the drama
<GOOD> That one isn't AI
<GOOD> That's the image
<GOOD> It's meant to emulate downloading some FNAF free ransomware off the internet
<GOOD> It's like a bootleg version where the ppl that made it planted a virus or whatever
<GOOD> Some of it is kinda funny tho
<GOOD> I'm almost certain it was made as a shitpost but I'm still interested by it
<GOOD> Actually all of that is normal
<GOOD> So it's evidently not that easy to tell
<GOOD> And that part is the AI upscaling part
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> The title screen funny af tho I'm ngl
<GOOD> Absolutely
<GOOD> You'd have to pay me to leave
<GOOD> I should play FNAC
<GOOD> But like the games aren't that good ngl
<GOOD> Prob
<GOOD> But then like, 2 and 3 are just ok
<GOOD> Well 2 is awful
<GOOD> But 3 is just ok
<GOOD> I mean in 2 you're invincible anyway
<GOOD> Emil made all of the animatronics but 2 the exact fucking same so the same thing works on all of them
<GOOD> Also new Popgoes thing got revealed
<GOOD> Which is newt
<GOOD> Meat
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Been busy on guilty gear
<GOOD> No that was different
<GOOD> Kane revealed MyPopgoes
<GOOD> Which is like an Arcade style thing
<GOOD> Much smaller
<GOOD> I don't think so
<GOOD> Might be a remaster
<GOOD> I love discworld this makes me sad
<GOOD> Is the 3rd one cooking meth
<GOOD> Or harvesting organs
<GOOD> God I can't wait to do D&D again
<GOOD> Brand new module too so 0 spoilers
<GOOD> I gotta think of a sort of backstory for my character tho
<GOOD> But like a weird one
<GOOD> It's rlly difficult to think about
<GOOD> Yea but they already set ground rules
<GOOD> Basically the way the story works is that we start not knowing
<GOOD> And the backstory has to end with a murder of my character under mysterious circumstance
<GOOD> It's a v weird module
<GOOD> I mean I already have the character/personality
<GOOD> I just do not have the backstory to make it mesh
<GOOD> The thing is the setting is inherently chaotic and unfitting here
<GOOD> No like, reality bending type chaotic
<GOOD> I think it's called Turn of Fortune's Wheel
<GOOD> But basically multiverse bullshit
<GOOD> I don't know anything about it
<GOOD> But apparently we're like, stranded/fragmented personalities or something
<GOOD> And therefore our backstories are a bunch of possible pasts that we don't know shit about
<GOOD> Yea but in terms of writing a backstory and a concern of not fitting in
<GOOD> I don't think there's much of a fear of that esp since my character is kinda generic
<GOOD> Well not generic, but not exactly exotic
<GOOD> They're a firbolg chef (strength monk) that hunts and fights his own food to provide for a family and friends (or I guess they did because like yeah fragmented personality etcetc)
<GOOD> But that means he's slow to rely on people because he usually values the laws of the jungle
<GOOD> So honestly alignment is also a bit up in the air but for now it's probably neutral
<GOOD> Yea that's what they are rn
<GOOD> Their death could be basically anything tho which is hard to narrow down
<GOOD> I haven't been told much about the setting for a start, I'll think about the other questions
<GOOD> Hunts out of passion for cooking and nature because he's a firbolg, that heightened attachment to nature allows him to have a higher level of respect for his craft.
His village is surrounded by wild beasts with agriculture yielding bland food or unsatisfactory amounts of them perhaps, either that or it's a passion rather than an obligation.
Absolutely they like it, while they don't like wanton murder he follows the rules of the food chain, which for him is interpreted as Might makes Right. As long as he respects the food he makes, he sees no issue with the sacrifice of animals and plants to nourish others.
I honestly don't know about the fragments yet
<GOOD> I guess this is just a brainstorm
<GOOD> But basically the fragments are Apparently just that only my personality is left rn, and that when I try and recall my past it's a shitton of *possible* things that happened in the past from different versions of me
<GOOD> Thank you Daggz
<GOOD> I LOVE FREDDY SEDY
<GOOD> Isn't Microsoft rumoured to be losing IP exclusivity somewhat
<GOOD> I wonder if they'll just focus on PC and rake it in like a larger Sega
<GOOD> Starfield is the one rumoured to be losing exclusivity
<GOOD> At least if random twitter people are to be trusted
<GOOD> Historic ripples in gaming then probably
<GOOD> Like, this is huge
<GOOD> Minecraft is finally going cross platform!?!?
<GOOD> Did I need to /s that
<GOOD> Minecraft has been on console for like 12 years now
<GOOD> I listen to german imperial marching music, Eminem, and Video game OSTs
<GOOD> Not as niche as expected
<GOOD> I completely lost motivation to develop my doodles ughhh
<GOOD> The Sirehound is still with us dw
<GOOD> I wonder if they'll allow the mouse in Fortnite
<GOOD> THERE'S A STITCH SPACESHIP IN THE TRAILER
<GOOD> Disney Infinity if it was awesome
<GOOD> Wreck it Ralph skins
<GOOD> Add Toy Story
<GOOD> Shut up Jonesy, I'll kill you.
<GOOD> On the right
<GOOD> There is also a Ralph building in the bottom
<GOOD> If they add Kamen Rider I'm gonna scream tbh, I ain't even watched that shit yet and I love it
<GOOD> I don't know where to start
<GOOD> Or where to watch it
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> Oh I spaced out
<GOOD> Those are weird themes
<GOOD> HUH!?
<GOOD> Also do you think Sora Fortnite is possible now that Epic has a Disney stake
<GOOD> Idk how good of a term they are on with Square
<GOOD> Overwatch 2 is getting a Bebop crossover.
<GOOD> I'm so upset
<GOOD> Gamen Rider!?!?!?
<GOOD> What the fuck why did he do that
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> The gamer suit
<GOOD> How many series are there?
<GOOD> What is the theme for Geats then?
<GOOD> Oh oki
<GOOD> Game show is a cool theme
<GOOD> Kakemn rider gamer!!!!
<GOOD> Pixels if it was good but not as peak as Pixels
<GOOD> Idk the only thing I've seen of Kamen Rider is a bit of a manga and apparently there's just a scene in one series where the villains open a coffin and he's just... in there
<GOOD> Analogue horror???
<GOOD> I played Miku today
<GOOD> She kicked my ass even on Normal
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Sometimes I feel bad about buying games then remember how much my flatmates spend on drinks and are still ok
<GOOD> Literally McDonald's every other day too like
<GOOD> That shit's expensive I'm making like 2 whole days of food off less than 5 or smth
<GOOD> But they get it delivered
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> It would be faster to cook food
<GOOD> They order other shit
<GOOD> It's probably just laziness which I kinda get
<GOOD> But like it's baffling is cooking not fun
<GOOD> I feel
<GOOD> So stupid rn
<GOOD> I only realised recently that if you do voice training you can still drop it
<GOOD> I made my throat sore because I got carried away voice training
<GOOD> Dies
<GOOD> It's going decently rn
<GOOD> My original voice feels more awkward which is probably a bit of a good sign
<GOOD> But yk baby steps
<GOOD> I'm just gonna go for less gravelly and flat rather than straight up fem
<GOOD> What the fuck would quadruple A even mean
<GOOD> I played lethal company
<GOOD> I suck ass
<GOOD> I died almost every run lmfao
<GOOD> Though tbf some were not my fault
<GOOD> Like when we all died because someone brought bees inside the ship
<GOOD> I'm completely blind going into this game
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I landed, my friend got chased by a giant spider immediately after entering and then I ran away from it through a turret room, my friend said something is behind you in the walkie talkie the second I crouched down and I died a second later
<GOOD> And then I was told later I had to be looking at the thing that was gonna kill me
<GOOD> I saw it later on someone else's POV, it looked like a tentacle man
<GOOD> Or a centipede
<GOOD> It wrapped around my head from behind and killed me
<GOOD> And when my friend looked at it it ran away
<GOOD> Is it for Palworld
<GOOD> I feel like I was seen by the leaf
<GOOD> But idk
<GOOD> It didn't look like a leaf
<GOOD> I'm good, Wren can have it if they want
<GOOD> If not then idk
<GOOD> Ok nvm it was the leaf guy
<GOOD> My drawing was the spitting image tbh
<GOOD> Also there was like a lumpy thing outside
<GOOD> It was very loud
<GOOD> I was already dead but my friends hid inside and it ran
<GOOD> Do I even need to say it
<GOOD> I also died to one of these
<GOOD> My friend called it a small blip on the map
<GOOD> It was not small
<GOOD> So far that's everything I've seen
<GOOD> Minus like, bees and large spiders
<GOOD> I also saw this which I'm gonna assume was just a dog scurrying in the dark
<GOOD> But if it wasn't then idk
<GOOD> Grow up
<GOOD> You'd think after the billionth joke it would become not as funny
<GOOD> But apparently people liking Hazbin Hotel proves that wrong
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Sounds right up your alley
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> How is steam so impermeable in this game
<GOOD> Can't see shit
<GOOD> Hm I wonder if shovels work on spiders
<GOOD> Or how well
<GOOD> I will smoosh the spider
<GOOD> I'm gonna fucking lose it
<GOOD> I'm not a Birmingham city fan (or any because my dad chose the team) but the scran looks good
<GOOD> It's a Wolves family I'm afraid
<GOOD> Go to a lower league club or smth
<GOOD> Diabolical scran
<GOOD> Raaaa I'm on quota 3 for Lethal Company
<GOOD> And I survived an Eclipse
<GOOD> MAJIN PIKACHU
<GOOD> This looks like one of those anime inbreeding images
<GOOD> Where it's on a scale of 1 to 9
<GOOD> QUOTA 4 RAAAA
<GOOD> We're doing well
<GOOD> We have done an Eclipse tbf
<GOOD> By accident
<GOOD> Yea my friend got lost and I ended up walking from the ship to the door to the ship twice in pitch black before he got back
<GOOD> We did tho
<GOOD> Also our first D&D session went well
<GOOD> The new player in our party enjoyed
<GOOD> But we went to a mid risk moon and something weird happened
<GOOD> Apparently there was a creature behind us the entire time we were there
<GOOD> But we never saw it, it moved really fast and it only stopped when we were around a corner
<GOOD> We also never heard it
<GOOD> Even when we were a few feet away
<GOOD> I feel like such a nerd even at my gaming society
<GOOD> Ranting about Pikmin or VGC or some shit and other ppl are like I like Mario! :DD They're so nice but I feel so weird
<GOOD> I should try AC1 some time
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I may also complete Chrono Trigger this week
<GOOD> But I forgot where I was in the game
<GOOD> Yay I'm stuck in Chrono Trigger
<GOOD> I made progress in Chrono Trigger
<GOOD> Finally the fucking caveman area actually has a purpose after me milling around it blindly a bunch of times
<GOOD> So has Xbox sold out their exclusive shit yet
<GOOD> Why is this interaction sending me
<GOOD> ROGUELITE SPLOON
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> new Salmon Run map goes crazy too
<GOOD> I love strawmen!!!
<GOOD> I should play MGS2 ngl
<GOOD> I got stuck on the roof at the very start for like 5 minutes then didn't come back to the game
<GOOD> I'm rlly bad at games apparently
<GOOD> I did beat the first short campaign tho
<GOOD> Am I fucking stupid
<GOOD> I just jumped down an elevator shaft
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> XP only
<GOOD> I ordered a new plug for the first time in forever and plugging in my phone to SUPER FAST CHARGING, 1 hour till full charge fills me with an indescribable joy
<GOOD> I think imma take a break from chrono trigger to try and progress in this game
<GOOD> I'm not getting burnt out but I just don't wanna play it tn
<GOOD> Rn
<GOOD> And it feels a bit wild goose chasey even though it isn't
<GOOD> It's worth it my last charger was like your charger is damaged, it will take 16 fucking hours to fully charge
<GOOD> Kill this person?
<GOOD> Pokemon if it was written b-
<GOOD> Also holy shit this art goes hard as fuck
<GOOD> But idk why Cell is just chilling back there
<GOOD> Vegeta is simply that small compared to Cell
<GOOD> Perfecter cell
<GOOD> Fancy paperweight
<GOOD> I should start buying those scrap/broken consoles for decoration tbh
<GOOD> Did you know, in BT3, no one makes him flinch... except for....
<GOOD> 6 months will always exist
<GOOD> These are so peak
<GOOD> No one hits flying types | except for...
<GOOD> I like how the videos aren't even that clickbaity
<GOOD> Like the stuff in his videos are true
<GOOD> Ngl I dig that colour
<GOOD> It's not even uneven
<GOOD> NEW PEARL AND MARINA RENDERS
<GOOD> RAAAAA
<GOOD> I would but then I'm like, if I get a GBA I still need to buy the games
<GOOD> Shush I love Pearl
<GOOD> She's a gremlin
<GOOD> Actual goblin creature I love her
<GOOD> And she beefed with Frye like 2 days ago
<GOOD> We also saw Super Big Man
<GOOD> I can't get off this roof
<GOOD> I think I'm stupid
<GOOD> It's a comically large jacket
<GOOD> Amiibo card ass render
<GOOD> Wario's loyal steed
<GOOD> This game just showing MGS1 VR training footage is so funny
<GOOD> I didn't even do any of those, I probably should have
<GOOD> HE SAID THE THING
<GOOD> I think I'm about halfway to 3/4 through MGS2
<GOOD> It may
<GOOD> Yeah that's kinda my issue with the GBA
<GOOD> I can't buy the games for the console because the console is kinda cheap but the games expensive af
<GOOD> Maybe I could buy a PS1
<GOOD> I have none
<GOOD> Like basically 0
<GOOD> Unless the gamecube is old enough to be considered retro
<GOOD> Then I own a DS and GC
<GOOD> I was not aware of that
<GOOD> When I have a bit more space I'll probably get one and some bulk games then
<GOOD> Fucking what lmao, MGS2 is 5
<GOOD> I thought MGS2 would be kinda hot ticket just because MGS is a headliner series for the PlayStation
<GOOD> Guess not
<GOOD> I gotta go check that
<GOOD> I might do that now ngl
<GOOD> It's only a short walk
<GOOD> The definitive edition of MGS2 is also 5 apparently
<GOOD> Complete with case and manual
<GOOD> Yea I rlly want to try Armoured Core but I'll probably emulate that for now
<GOOD> In case I just don't like the game and don't wanna spend money to know that
<GOOD> SMT is one I kinda wanted to play but ehh
<GOOD> Makes sense they'd be pricey tho
<GOOD> Oh damn FF7 with manual and boxed is 18 at CeX
<GOOD> I feel a very accumulatively expensive hobby coming along
<GOOD> What's the best selling
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Hopefully my local CeX has stuff
<GOOD> Also I expected number 1 to be Crash ngl
<GOOD> I will probably get it as well
<GOOD> I don't know if the games themselves are changed tho
<GOOD> Also I'm officially in Shell 2 in MGS2
<GOOD> I also got the reveal about Solidus
<GOOD> And the Patriots kind of
<GOOD> And Arsenal Gear
<GOOD> It was like being punched in the face with that many plot twists
<GOOD> I mean it makes sense to me
<GOOD> It was just shocking
<GOOD> Zamn
<GOOD> They have a PS2 shelf tio
<GOOD> Kingdom Hearts for 5
<GOOD> Dam
<GOOD> Final fantasy 12 is 2
<GOOD> As is 10
<GOOD> Happy feet is 50p
<GOOD> I forgot eyetoy existed
<GOOD> Also there are 3 Happy Feet copies
<GOOD> I could buy all 3 copies of Happy Feet
<GOOD> Will it be under G
<GOOD> I'll have to look in a sec someone is hovering behind me
<GOOD> Going back to the Switch games then to the PS2
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Also there are so many physical PC disks
<GOOD> I know where to go for 50p bejeweled now
<GOOD> All the PS2 games btw
<GOOD> So much PES
<GOOD> I don't think I can do much about that
<GOOD> Holy shit 24 the game
<GOOD> I really could do it...
<GOOD> I'll come back after I get a PS2, it's not like it's going anywhere
<GOOD> It was me, DJ! I bought all 3 copies of Happy Feet PS2
<GOOD> Also almost all of them were sports or poker games
<GOOD> Par for the course for CEX
<GOOD> There's a second hand store around here
<GOOD> I wonder if they have a bargain bin of games
<GOOD> They did not have games
<GOOD> Just cassettes and vinyls and books and furniture
<GOOD> Also I found a tattoo place but the door was one of those sick ass skeleton images
<GOOD> Like it was stretched across the entire door
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Also I just found out my accommodation for next year is less than 30 seconds away from a Lidl
<GOOD> Like literally cross 1 road and I'm done
<GOOD> Lidl got good ass deals
<GOOD> Nah their meats are good
<GOOD> Fellas it's time for the middle aisle of lidl...
<GOOD> I bought a bag of 50 frozen chicken Nuggets
<GOOD> They will give my family sustenance through winter
<GOOD> When is that Xbox thing happening
<GOOD> Lmfao Xbox is never embracing that Blue Ocean strategy
<GOOD> What if we made another console to get into another hardware arms race with another company?
<GOOD> New gear....
<GOOD> I must grind....
<GOOD> I love games where 4 silly billies work for minimal pay by risking their lives
<GOOD> What the actual fuck does this MGS twist mean
<GOOD> No, apparently in MGS2 ||everything was orchestrated from the start somehow? ||
<GOOD> I don't know what that means
<GOOD> Like it's so fucking convoluted to explain how that worked
<GOOD> WHAT DO THEY MEAN THEY'RE IMMORTAL
<GOOD> I've beaten MGS2
<GOOD> Downloading all 3 disks of MGS3 Substinence rn
<GOOD> I have started MGS3
<GOOD> Apparently it is quite cutscene heavy
<GOOD> I mean I'm still in the intro to 3
<GOOD> It seems like a very long intro
<GOOD> Good start to the game
<GOOD> I've died 3 times in the first populated area
<GOOD> This game doesn't seem amazing so far :/
<GOOD> But I'll keep going
<GOOD> MGS3
<GOOD> Mind you I'm not v far in
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> I like the varying line thickness
<GOOD> Ok this game is already starting to piss me off
<GOOD> No radar, smarter AI, nowhere to hide so I have to crawl fucking everywhere
<GOOD> Every single resource is limited
<GOOD> And once I'm spotted it's immediately over
<GOOD> Fuck this
<GOOD> I want stealth and then I have to brute force my way through anyway because every single enemy can see and hear me at the drop of a pin
<GOOD> And they immediately alert absolutely everyone else the second I do anything
<GOOD> Why is this on my kitchen table
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I feel bad for Frye fans even though I never pick her team
<GOOD> It's so funny
<GOOD> She would do better if she wasn't the worst idol
<GOOD> How dare you
<GOOD> Big Man is a saint
<GOOD> I hate Frye the best moment she had was getting dunked on by Pearl (best Idol)
<GOOD> I need her crown from the amiibo
<GOOD> Yeah I need to buy more
<GOOD> But Side Order comes first
<GOOD> I have been saving for it
<GOOD> Also apparently there are a bunch of 100 ___ puns sites that are wholly AI generated and some of these are making me lose it
<GOOD> The forbidden zone
<GOOD> You don't get it, he's a little shellfish
<GOOD> Because it was like 100 funny Pac Man puns
<GOOD> It's degrading as it goes along
<GOOD> If Mario, then only bros! Has done Irreparable damage to my humour
<GOOD> Also relevant but yesterday I beat my friend's Kazuya with Pac Man in Smash and I have never played him so I may take the Pac Pill
<GOOD> For now, just Smash
<GOOD> But Pac Man World Re Pac has been looking appealing
<GOOD> I also beat him while using that god awful Plaid gloves alt he has
<GOOD> Also I didn't watch this at first because I thought it was the regular and not no no no no NO!-core Gohan
<GOOD> I'm very excited
<GOOD> I didn't expect a roguelike mode I love Roguelikes
<GOOD> I hope they add unlockables for playing past completion tho, you kinda need an incentive to run it again
<GOOD> I know there are a few but idk what else was there
<GOOD> All I know of is the new salmon run gear and the white replica suit/weapons which are cool
<GOOD> Idk where to find datamines
<GOOD> I need to grind SR so fucking much
<GOOD> The octoling gear is peak
<GOOD> OE?
<GOOD> I haven't played previous Sploons much
<GOOD> Good news(?)
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> 800 bronze scales tho :((
<GOOD> Bit fruity perhaps
<GOOD> I like it
<GOOD> Inklings made me enby so that checks out
<GOOD> Literally the first time I got gender envy was from Captain
<GOOD> Agent 3
<GOOD> Their cool hat and lack of gender was too cool for me to resist
<GOOD> And then I was like man, I wish I didn't have a gender
<GOOD> And then it begun
<GOOD> Also I just realised you changed your pfp, were you too late?
<GOOD> Discord user Orimah
<GOOD> It's so funny that SSJ3 has done so little that this is the most important thing associated with it in my mind
<GOOD> Sick ass Tien edit-core
<GOOD> Tbf he deserved that gas for the confetti kamehameha alone
<GOOD> Bluegeta
<GOOD> Who is this character and why isn't he mentioned again?
<GOOD> Yeah when saiyans die they turn into water and evaporate like in Attack on Titan
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> The head lmfao
<GOOD> He looks like he still has a soft spot you can press down on
<GOOD> You could call him Baby Vegeta, perhaps
<GOOD> If he didn't want to be called Baby why did he not give himself a name
<GOOD> Dumbass baby
<GOOD> Holy fuck the new OP volume cover goes hard
<GOOD> I forgot why Luffy lost his shirt
<GOOD> I think it was lasers
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> Also I was looking at DBZ memes funny for dumpster diving and I found gold
<GOOD> I know what they were going for with the 2nd one but it just reminds me of the microwave baby gif
<GOOD> Adulthood is when you idolise Vegeta mfs when they watch Majin Vegeta blow up innocents
<GOOD> Why did they have to neuter Vegeta by making him a family man
<GOOD> He tries to WHAT
<GOOD> Also ngl Saiyan Saga Vegeta is one of my favourite DB villains
<GOOD> Like 2nd favourite behind Baby
<GOOD> Also I have reached like 2011 era memes
<GOOD> Tbf that one is funny
<GOOD> As it turns out the entire universe is gender
<GOOD> When I became agender as did the universe
<GOOD> MHNow looks decent ig
<GOOD> New creatures....
<GOOD> Also I need to try this creature immediately
<GOOD> I need to know more
<GOOD> What are they meant to be
<GOOD> Apparently they are a degenerate species of prawn
<GOOD> So it's Monster Hunter
<GOOD> I am so fucking bored
<GOOD> Perhaps
<GOOD> I want a new fit in game but idk what to go for
<GOOD> I hate clam blitz
<GOOD> Ngl reading the news makes me violent I should stop
<GOOD> Well pathetic violent and upset moreso
<GOOD> Not gonna talk about it here but hate crimes
<GOOD> And in general tbh
<GOOD> I need this
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I'm planning to get some amiibo gear too, specifically the pearl crown and the beaten school jacket
<GOOD> I have started Cyber Sleuth
<GOOD> Pokemon would never
<GOOD> This starter pretty cool ngl
<GOOD> I can't wait to see what evos they get
<GOOD> I'm going in blind probably
<GOOD> Uh oh
<GOOD> They showed the new Explosher kit
<GOOD> I only use Custom Splatty Jr rn
<GOOD> I need another weapon to use, might use the Eliter
<GOOD> Trying not to tilt at Splatoon but it's so fucking hard
<GOOD> I can't play it for shit
<GOOD> Nah I just decided to try chargers
<GOOD> Big mistake, I did well one time and when I posted the clip on the splatoon discord to be like I'm getting a bit better! I immediately got ripped into lmao
<GOOD> Idk what weapon to try because I always get absolutely shredded by everyone and lose anyway
<GOOD> Idk I just get so frustrated at the game
<GOOD> And I wish I didn't
<GOOD> Maybe I should just try a shitton of weapons but like you gotta spend licenses on them
<GOOD> And I'm not good at any weapon so womp womp
<GOOD> What is Endless Ocean
<GOOD> Is it an MMO?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> The trailer made it seem like one
<GOOD> Just an MO
<GOOD> Ohmygod Twitter I don't fucking want Radfems on my timeline
<GOOD> Supermarket
<GOOD> I hope this is true
<GOOD> Yea I've heard
<GOOD> Zoro: haaah.... this Pica guy is tough. Where did he get that power?
Corazon:
<GOOD> I miss my dog
<GOOD> MGS3 is good now damn
<GOOD> I wish I didn't fucking suck at this game tho
<GOOD> I constantly get spotted
<GOOD> I beat The End
<GOOD> Normal
<GOOD> Also it was really good
<GOOD> The bosses in this game have been good so far
<GOOD> I give up
<GOOD> I fucking don't understand why this is so much harder for 0 reason
<GOOD> MGS3 to 2
<GOOD> They made all the guards ridiculously sensitive for no reason
<GOOD> I am playing in Subsistence camera and there are less options
<GOOD> I just said what
<GOOD> Subsistence has a different camera
<GOOD> The guards being more smart is fucking me over
<GOOD> Because they'll spot me from anywhere after 10 minutes of painfully slow sneaking, alert everyone else immediately then I either brute force it like I've had to do for every area so far, or just wait like 5 minutes for them to go away
<GOOD> Guards see you if you run
<GOOD> They have eyes in the back of their heads
<GOOD> They also have insane peripheral vision in this game
<GOOD> There are also more of them and you don't have a radar
<GOOD> They can hear you in MGS1 and 2, it was just reasonable
<GOOD> I've just been charging through the areas because I give up
<GOOD> Like I can't fucking sneak through a single area
<GOOD> Because all of the guards are immediately on alert
<GOOD> That isn't stealth
<GOOD> It is a stealth game
<GOOD> Just running to the exit of the area just makes the whole game into Dark Souls suicide runs
<GOOD> I have no idea why they give you worse equipment in this one either
<GOOD> I also don't understand why ppl have been hyping it up to me like this
<GOOD> But it's exactly like that
<GOOD> It's even worse in this game
<GOOD> It can be downright impossible to know a guard's location sometimes, they spot you and alert far faster and easier
<GOOD> And your healing is massively nerfed
<GOOD> Because they made it take eons to heal for no reason
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> The things that heal me requiring me to go and make irl dinner while waiting to go to full HP
<GOOD> Subsistence is the definitive edition of MGS3
<GOOD> It's like Substance for 2
<GOOD> I just explained what Subsistence is
<GOOD> Then that Substance is the same but for 2
<GOOD> I haven't played much with the original camera, but the camera in this can be changed to go behind you
<GOOD> It's a 3D camera
<GOOD> The one in the original MGS3 was pretty clunky so they gave a new option in Subsistence
<GOOD> The wide perspective is usually still about 5 feet in front of you so
<GOOD> Whereas the guards can see you from everywhere because of course they can
<GOOD> I'm so fucking tired of it
<GOOD> Like just give me my actually functional radar back
<GOOD> The one they make you have is shit and pointless
<GOOD> Like I can either only detect motion (pointless against guards that aren't moving or in areas with lots of animals) or only detect objects (pointless)
<GOOD> I have found 0 use for the sonar so far
<GOOD> I'm jumping into the fray
<GOOD> ZA
<GOOD> I think it's 2 versions
<GOOD> Because they said releasing simultaneously
<GOOD> NOOOOO
<GOOD> PYORO WE LOVE YOU
<GOOD> I have been corrected dw
<GOOD> Megas back
<GOOD> I'm actually just being sarcastic I hate megas
<GOOD> I had a horrific splitting headache so I slept for 1 hour and it went away
<GOOD> Fuck you body
<GOOD> My friend invited me to her friend server and I'm too scared to hop in a VC with strangers
<GOOD> Awesome
<GOOD> Why does Studio Ghibli Coke made the old fashioned way look so good
<GOOD> Rip I can't play Mgs4 or 5
<GOOD> Well 4 at least
<GOOD> I think I can run 5 but I want to play 4
<GOOD> I wonder if I can run MGRR
<GOOD> So like why is MGRR the way it is
<GOOD> Why is Raiden like that what happened to him
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Also I looked up MGS4 and I saw Ocelot kissing Snake I think
<GOOD> Also why does Ocelot in 3 keep doing the Mr Beast thing
<GOOD> I lost it every time he did it
<GOOD> Also I just didn't understand the ending or message of the game at all except war bad and government bad
<GOOD> Also the Eva escort section was ass
<GOOD> Worse than the section in 2 where I accidentally chokeslammed Otacon's sister and carried her around instead
<GOOD> Also The Boss was just a decent fight
<GOOD> So my boss ranking is:
The End
The Fury
The Fear
The Boss
The Sorrow
The Pain
Volgin
<GOOD> Volgin was so shit he made me so mad
<GOOD> Oh also Ocelot is probably above the Fear or smth
<GOOD> I love the Unknown
<GOOD> I wonder how it'll be in 6 months
<GOOD> I was looking for patches on Etsy and this was a featured ad
<GOOD> Hopefully if I ever break up with someone they won't call an evil fucked up dark wizard
<GOOD> It looks like an ad for gambling addiction
<GOOD> Hoooly shit
<GOOD> Absolutely
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I mean Rika isn't that fem even without
<GOOD> I mean who else is just fem with a suit
<GOOD> Geeta I *guess*?
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> Most scathing review there could possibly be for this movie tbh
<GOOD> Then you don't know Kojima that well
<GOOD> I saw it is literally the worst review you can get from him, it would literally be better if he hadn't watched
<GOOD> His own usual reviews
<GOOD> Then read the context clues of them
<GOOD> Kojima is a passionate man, but if there's something utterly dogshit he doesn't give it the time of day in his reviews
<GOOD> I want it
<GOOD> This may be the origin of my interest in Tokusatsu
<GOOD> (This counts surely)
<GOOD> Ough why does Sephiroth look so cool and make me want to play FF7
<GOOD> Also I tried to draw him and when I got to his torso I gave him boobs by accident
<GOOD> I can't draw him
<GOOD> But he's also just like, the sickest design ever somehow
<GOOD> He's so cool
<GOOD> I especially like his original + Smash hair idk why they removed the silly in the remake
<GOOD> I love the chocobo
<GOOD> Who made this
<GOOD> Ok but the output is like, dogshit
<GOOD> And forever
<GOOD> Because it doesn't understand how to make a movie, it understands how to make a long video
<GOOD> Key distinction
<GOOD> AI can't make art, it can make images
AI can't make a movie, it can make a video
<GOOD> Early youtube was art
<GOOD> In fact Early youtube was probably one of the worst comparisons to make because it was good due to passion and fun and human experience alone rather than budget or technology
<GOOD> The closest comparison possible would be one of the recent ass Marvel movies but even then there was effort put into those
<GOOD> AI just creates the most unimaginably bland slop possible which is why corporations don't care about using it
<GOOD> Are you gonna detail your point or no
<GOOD> Corporations use AI because they don't care that it makes slop, what am I not gonna believe
<GOOD> By using a machine that is owned by
<GOOD> And is trained on what
<GOOD> Using AI is feeding a corporation, not rebelling against it
<GOOD> It isn't passionate, it doesn't understand how a movie works, it does not understand art
<GOOD> It cannot create art
<GOOD> Then why can't they just make it themselves
<GOOD> Hell, low budget scripted content has worked before
<GOOD> I mean it's not the hardest fact to throw out
<GOOD> With 0 concept of framing, emotion and passion
<GOOD> An AI can only understand so much
<GOOD> It can understand literary devices and tropes but they have to have already been made, or filmed, or drawn, or done
<GOOD> It has to take them
<GOOD> Would still create slop
<GOOD> You can make it look good but you can't make it look human
<GOOD> Like that one shitty video of the creature burning itself on a candle
<GOOD> It doesn't understand why the creature would be moving the way it does, what expressions it would make, what motive it has
<GOOD> It doesn't understand emotion which is the key facet of art
<GOOD> And that is so much better omg, AI always makes it better just look at
<GOOD> Um
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> Literally the only example I've ever seen public generative AI used for in a good light is just upscaling textures
<GOOD> Which is like, yeah can I make this texture not crusty thanks
<GOOD> At what cost
<GOOD> How do you modify the output
<GOOD> The thing can barely understand what it's making or remember what something would look like 10 seconds into the future
<GOOD> It would be more worth your time to literally just film the movie yourself because at the very least you've created what you wanted
<GOOD> Well I gave up on Fear and Hunger
<GOOD> I'm apparently halfway through 25 minutes into a save
<GOOD> The game is rlly boring since everyone just dies like instantly if you do anything lmao
<GOOD> Meh
<GOOD> Doesn't seem like I lost much
<GOOD> The game is pretty bad
<GOOD> Guess I missed out by buying 1
<GOOD> Unless 2 is similarly ass
<GOOD> It's not that big if I'm already pretty far in apparently
<GOOD> Literally like 25 minutes if you mean save time wise, I got stonewalled by a ghost just not moving and gave up because there was no way past it
<GOOD> I got 2 new party members, got the Deep Cube or whatever the fuck and then couldn't make any progress whatsoever
<GOOD> Because RNG reliant progress is very fun trust
<GOOD> Like, there wasn't a point in the game that even felt interesting bc like
<GOOD> I just knew I was gonna die anyway so there was no point
<GOOD> Random nails killing your run immediately 
Random attacks being able to dismember you, killing your run immediately
Random enemies being able to randomly stonewall your progress, killing your run
<GOOD> Oh and the random looting and the random chance of attacks hitting and the random chance of saving the game working and the random chance of immediately dying by exploring and the
<GOOD> There's no tension if you know what's gonna happen
<GOOD> It also discourages doing
Well anything except looting and even then maybe not
<GOOD> I mean the crow bastard just isn't scary after the very first time you see it
<GOOD> Because you're just like oh no strong enemy that kills you immediately
<GOOD> Same as the smough looking dude
<GOOD> Also a lot of the semi-random things are just ooooh a thing to investigate- *rocks fall everyone dies*
<GOOD> Or a boss attacks, mutilates you and means you can't make progress because healing is scarce
<GOOD> Idk I never even attempted fighting him
<GOOD> Because he was the ooga booga big strong enemy you never go near
<GOOD> List of healing I've currently found:
>Blue liquid
>
>
>
<GOOD> Wow that's so well explained
<GOOD> Especially early game when healing is literally necessary for progressing and understanding the game
<GOOD> And I need soul stones for them and then I need to fill the stones and find a hexing table and eventually maybe I unlock the ability to HEAL
<GOOD> In an RPG
<GOOD> Almost like it's the early game
<GOOD> >understand a mechanic that comes later in the game
<GOOD> And then you need enough to unlock healing, and then access to a hexing table
<GOOD> Regaining HP is a key mechanic in any RPG tho
<GOOD> Line between hard and bullshit
<GOOD> And it's def not hard
<GOOD> Like oh you missed 1 attack, the enemy swings and mutilates you completely killing you immediately
<GOOD> Or you decided to fight an enemy on the intended route of progression, they immediately cave your skull in and you die
<GOOD> Jumpscare
<GOOD> Also taking 1 hit doesn't mean your entire game is over
<GOOD> If you lose a limb in Fear and Hunger, you should literally just reset
<GOOD> Because there is no point
<GOOD> It doesn't benefit you in the slightest to continue if you lose a limb
<GOOD> Can't hold a shield, can't hold 2 handed weapons, if you get infected you either lose the other one or die
<GOOD> So reset
<GOOD> I don't hate limb loss, I hate the game being horrifically unfair lmfao
<GOOD> Like in other RPGs, your RNG can lose you like, a fight or be a resource drain
<GOOD> In this one it just kills you or forces you to completely butcher your run
<GOOD> It's not well designed tho
<GOOD> Me making the hit RPG where every attack has a 20% chance to connect and if the enemy attacks they have a 20% chance to behead you immediately
<GOOD> And at the end of every turn they have a 50% chance to make you watch a 2 minute cutscene of them eating you
<GOOD> Ok but like, what's the point
<GOOD> And it's random who is on the recieving end of said attack
<GOOD> It could even just be all of them because why not
<GOOD> Like yeah great ty for the slash that removes my arm and also makes my party member bleed out and also removes my other party member's leg
<GOOD> All of the bosses have been easy so far though
<GOOD> At least the ones that aren't giant sacs of stats that aren't meant to be beaten yet
<GOOD> Because the game's progression is based on brute force lmfao
<GOOD> Like from start to end so far it has just been walk, die, walk, die
<GOOD> Me learning to fight the guard only to miss 3 attacks in a row and die
<GOOD> (This is completely my fault for playing the game as an RPG instead of kiting pokenon trainers)
<GOOD> The RNG does define the combat tho, because the RNG is significantly more heavy handed both in and out of battle
<GOOD> Like if one of my mons dies because I used a risky move, even in a nuzlocke, that is salvageable
<GOOD> If I use a random attack in Fear and Hunger there is a solid chance I just die
<GOOD> Or completely ruin my run up to that point
<GOOD> So don't attack
<GOOD> Gotcha
<GOOD> So like, what's the point of the game then
<GOOD> It's not scary, it's not interesting and it's not fun
<GOOD> Like yeah what if I *was* Guts from Berserk, but if Guts was not the protagonist and also wasn't actually strong
<GOOD> But it doesn't because it's just yeah you're gonna die lmao here's some ambience and naked monsters
<GOOD> Like the whole point of Berserk was that there was a point in struggling
<GOOD> Then what's actually interesting about FaH
<GOOD> Because it seems horribly short, poorly balanced and not grotesque enough to be disturbing but also dismal enough to feel pointless playing
<GOOD> The point being some dude told me to go rescue someone I have no attachment to
<GOOD> I have no reason to care about my character because I don't know him, I have no reason to care about who I'm saving because I haven't met him
<GOOD> Like did they forget Berserk moved on from Black Swordsman arc or smth
<GOOD> I mean they kinda matter if you want to like, care
<GOOD> Currently my character getting mutilated or skinned or whatever has 0 affect on me
<GOOD> Because like, who cares he's basically an NPC
<GOOD> So the point of the story is that I play as a character I dislike to find a character I don't know in a place that I hate and that hates me, that isn't fun to play and doesn't give me a reason to keep playing it
<GOOD> Am I getting that right
<GOOD> Why would I have a reason to like him
<GOOD> The only thing I can do *as* him are shitty or pointless
<GOOD> Like why would I care about the man
<GOOD> THAT'S THE FULL BACKSTORY!?
<GOOD> LMAO
<GOOD> You get like, his full backstory
<GOOD> But yea like, I have no reason to like this dude
<GOOD> Or care that these awful scary oooo aaaa things are happening to and around him
<GOOD> They aren't mine
<GOOD> They are a preset I picked and then watched get mutilated every 5 minutes for hours
<GOOD> Like yea I'm not gonna care
<GOOD> I mean I watched my dude get pulled apart in the least suprising way possible
<GOOD> Idk it just feels like watching an extra get killed in a movie, or some dude that got introduced 20 minutes ago
<GOOD> They don't have the substance for me to see them as a person so all the horrible things happening to them IMMEDIATELY, like with 0 hesitation, is like
<GOOD> I mean yeah if my arm was removed that would probably hurt lmfao
<GOOD> Like this is how it feels to me usually
<GOOD> Or text on a screen just being like yeah your arm is now gone
<GOOD> It's also something the game has to immerse you in
<GOOD> I mean that is what happened
<GOOD> I walked in, died to a guard, and then watched the post-death guard cutscene and I was just like oh so it's like that and my expectations were there for the entire rest of the game
<GOOD> So the only thing that ended up tense was the Crow Mauler which scared me one time because I didn't want to die to him
<GOOD> Like that's kinda why horror has a slow burn
<GOOD> If you show your hand immediately it defeats the tension
<GOOD> I mean there hasn't been anything worse than a guard yet
<GOOD> Yea but the tone was set to expect this to happen literally all the time
<GOOD> So when I got to scenes like trying to save and getting put on a torture rack it just wasn't suprising
<GOOD> Because by then I'd already been thrown in a pit of rotting flesh and had my arms torn off and had my legs cut off and had a rusty nail go through my foot and had a morningstar cave my skull in
<GOOD> Like on their own, ooo what if *this* happened to you would probably make me feel icky but it just makes me space out now lmao
<GOOD> The atmosphere is mostly reliant on tension tho
<GOOD> Tension that is thrown away by just being like there's a dude about to eat you in the next room over
<GOOD> I mean I haven't been intimidated by anything else so far so like
<GOOD> Nah I get scared by games suuuuuper easy
<GOOD> I also get unsettled by them
<GOOD> This game just isn't scary
<GOOD> Like it's not grotesque enough to be grossout scary, it's also not tense enough to be slow burn scary
<GOOD> It plays its hand too early and too over the top and then just does that again
<GOOD> Like yeah lmfao the dungeon can take this mf for all I care
<GOOD> Get this man a brazen bull ion know shit about him except he sounds like a stock D&D rogue
<GOOD> Is that the child
<GOOD> I freed her and then she did nothing and got cleaved in half by a guard lmfao
<GOOD> Then I got to the dude that buys children and was like damn I wish I had that child rn
<GOOD> I would be making bank tbh
<GOOD> L to her then
<GOOD> The protagonist plot armour wasn't enough to save against 1 singular attack from a guard
<GOOD> I have tried with every NPC I've encountered and it genuinely has worked twice
<GOOD> And one was because they introduced themselves to me as part of the story progression
<GOOD> I mean its ethical core is also built on sacrificing people to gain favour with eldritch gods
<GOOD> And the first option you can have in the game is beat up a dead horse
<GOOD> I haven't done any of that shit yet so like
<GOOD> I haven't been able to actually interact with anyone or anything
<GOOD> The best interactions I had was getting that orange haired girl in my party and pissing off a mage that wasn't there when I got back
<GOOD> I tried to take the child to the exit and it didn't work so
<GOOD> I wasn't gonna go through the effort of saving the child every run when it was simultaneously a waste of time and resources and would only lead to me dragging a small child into a more horrific place
<GOOD> Seems like everything is like:
You see a small puppy chewing on a bone!
>kick the puppy
>eat the puppy
>sacrifice the puppy
>Do Nothing
<GOOD> It's not too much of my choice
<GOOD> Like I have no incentive to do anything with anyone because it just means I'm gonna die or do something morally reprehensible
<GOOD> I just don't understand what's *good* about the game
<GOOD> It's a horror game that isn't scary, a gory game that isn't unsettling, an RPG that isn't balanced
<GOOD> Is it a rage game?
<GOOD> It just doesn't seem to have an appeal or reason to be fun
<GOOD> So anyway yeah game's kinda ass I wish I could have refunded it
<GOOD> 6 hours put in was too much time apparently
<GOOD> Did remind me that Berserk was rlly good tho
<GOOD> And that I gotta stop buying games bc they turn out disappointing
<GOOD> It's pretty boring but it does waste a lot of time
<GOOD> It's like if rapping your knuckles on a table a bit too hard for a few hours was a video game
<GOOD> We needed him in there tbh
<GOOD> Very motivational dude
<GOOD> I thought Poker only went up to 10
<GOOD> Fuck I love Berserk
<GOOD> I need to catch up
<GOOD> Sounds neat
<GOOD> Ugh I wanna buy a game but like
<GOOD> Don't know what
<GOOD> And I've already spent too much
<GOOD> Apparently FF7 is 10 and can be modded into a sort of definitive edition on Steam
<GOOD> Bro the scene actually went down like that except silent protagonist
<GOOD> The dude was like I'm cutting off your arms. I'm cutting off your legs. You're dead and then I died
<GOOD> Also he looked exactly like Griffith's torturer in Berserk which was probably the point
<GOOD> But like that mf did so much worse
<GOOD> The modding guide worked I think
<GOOD> Took a lot of time tho
<GOOD> Also these mods appear to make the game much easier which I don't mind
<GOOD> Like having exp share and taking a mechanic away from some later area, and I assume if there was a whole drop down menu in a mod to turn that specifically off then like
<GOOD> I probably didn't want it there
<GOOD> It was like don't collapse after a bit in ___ area so I was like sure yeah why not
<GOOD> This game is good so far
<GOOD> 2 and a half hours in
<GOOD> So I found out that one of the main reasons I wasn't enjoying funger was because they decided to lock starting with the most important thing in the game behind arbitrary character creation
<GOOD> That's not great
<GOOD> And I possibly made the worst choices possible by trying to make my character even mildly upstanding
<GOOD> That's uh
<GOOD> Not fun
<GOOD> It's a video game
<GOOD> Welp guess I'm restarting after 6 hours of progress
<GOOD> Because I bought it and can't refund it
<GOOD> And there's probably a bit more than meets the eye but my first playthrough felt utter shit almost wholly because of the general unwelcoming-ness of the game
<GOOD> And again, the fact that the best ability in the whole game is not built in as a mechanic from the start
<GOOD> Told it was like Berserk
<GOOD> Difficulty, NSFL stuff, a general seal of quality, some good graphics/art and designs, and a general hopeful outlook probably
<GOOD> At least that's how I take something being related to Berserk
<GOOD> I have played every Soulsborne game what gave you that idea
<GOOD> I don't care if a game is hard as long as it has a natural curve and actually teaches you it
<GOOD> Nah Souls teaches you how the game works, the only disproportionately hard beginning area is Iudex Gundyr in DS3
<GOOD> Sekiro has a short area with a scripted loss that sets up the game ahead, DS1 has a digestible boss that teaches you to look out for secret ways to get around them, Bloodborne doesn't even have a beginning boss it just has a big area and 1 starting enemy
<GOOD> And ngl I do not remember how DS2 starts
<GOOD> Fear and Hunger does not teach you a thing on the other hand, and throws the hardest generic enemy I've seen so far as the first encounter in the game
<GOOD> And fills the area with that enemy
<GOOD> The Guards are not like the Hollows in DS
<GOOD> They are faster than you if you don't take the key game mechanic of Dashing at the start of the game
<GOOD> Also the game has a Light mechanic
<GOOD> Where you only have a small circle around you to see
<GOOD> You can expand the circle by lighting a torch which is a very limited resource
<GOOD> It also makes every fight exorbitantly punishing to engage in usually because of how permanent the fallout of the fights usually are
<GOOD> I mean picking your fights isn't really a thing in Souls
<GOOD> Like you can but your healing isn't based wholly on items you have to pick up
<GOOD> They're refilled at bonfires and every interaction in the game is based on skill
<GOOD> Name one
<GOOD> There are barely even enemies in the game that don't die by you stabbing them a shitton of times
<GOOD> Now imagine if you had no method of not being in that situation in a fight
<GOOD> Like you got into that position by getting pushed there
<GOOD> And swinging wildly at the enemies usually works if there's that many because they're fodder
<GOOD> Like why are you trying to pull the isn't that just Dark Souls card when it has clearly explained mechanics and the less explained ones aren't necessary to understand to play because it's an ARPG where your input matters more than the gear you have
<GOOD> I'm ngl I kinda forgot how shit ER was for that thing
<GOOD> DS2 feels like a fever dream so as I said I forgor most of its progression but I remember it being very branched and I got lost
<GOOD> But I'll stand my ground on DS1 being fair enough
<GOOD> And I concede this is straight up wrong, I mostly meant it in terms of there being mostly safe fights to pick with enemies as most of your damage is caused by an inability to learn the timings etc
<GOOD> Like you should pick your fights but a lot of fodder enemies are feasibly beaten by just getting their ass
<GOOD> Well that's probably enough for today
<GOOD> I have a 4 person party (thank you dash ability and also lockpicking and Escape Plan)
<GOOD> Blindness is such an annoying status tho
<GOOD> I didn't know tbh
<GOOD> Also how tf do I stop myself getting my eyes removed
<GOOD> Idk I'm trying to kill a Crow Mauler but it always at the very least causes blindness
<GOOD> Turn 1 I use Red Vial with the girl, then double up into the arm
<GOOD> But it's random if they use Crows or not
<GOOD> Then turn 2 I use a Throwing Dart and Pummel the torso
<GOOD> It usually works but one character walks away blind
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Guess my strat is now to double the arm, double the other arm
<GOOD> I mean all of them suck
<GOOD> Like most are irreparable because I don't have green herbs
<GOOD> Also I found a scroll and taught it to the child but I couldn't save
<GOOD> Very unfortunate she is still useless for now
<GOOD> I also almost accidentally sold her to that dude
<GOOD> I thought you were talking about that Penny game ngl
<GOOD> With the yoyo
<GOOD> That's exactly like 3D sonic trust
<GOOD> I shouldn't have cooked
<GOOD> My 8bitdo is like the original famicom colours which is cool
<GOOD> One of these feels different to the others
<GOOD> I WILL be the first person to wish you a happy birthday
<GOOD> Ok but those don't count smh
<GOOD> No fucking way dude
<GOOD> I forgot how weird that dude was ngl
<GOOD> Big Boss if this random drunk dude didn't give him government secrets because he complimented his shoes
<GOOD> Augh please just give me a single green herb
<GOOD> I'm tired of sawing off linbs
<GOOD> Why can't you just use alcohol as a disinfectant
<GOOD> This game can go fuck itself tbh
<GOOD> They just crammed an enemy that can inflict 3 or 4 run ruining status effects in an area you need to go through
<GOOD> Very fun
<GOOD> Ok Crow Mauler down, big lizard down, weird white dude down
<GOOD> Makes your health worse too if you're apparently playing sharp lmao
<GOOD> No idea I'm just laughing at the slogan
<GOOD> I use disposable but I rlly should buy a reusable one to try on my arms and legs
<GOOD> And an electric one
<GOOD> I'm bad at shaving in general but oh well
<GOOD> Not like the cuts I cause are visible
<GOOD> I don't like electric because even the short hairs make me feel shit
<GOOD> In fact I've kinda had an issue recently where I've gone over some spots too many times bc there's a few v v short hairs that I can't remove and it makes it a bit sore
<GOOD> Oh I'm fully aware
<GOOD> I simply hate that I still have hairs there
<GOOD> It makes me annoyed so I keep going over the spots until they are smooth
<GOOD> No, because that is very expensive presumably and I'm a uni student
<GOOD> I need to get some proper razors and maybe an epilator
<GOOD> And an electric one
<GOOD> Unfortunately my face is one of my worst spots womp womp
<GOOD> If it's agonising then like sure idm it's probably worth to have every hair pulled out at the roots
<GOOD> So I made a lot of progress in Funger and now I'm just like
<GOOD> Stuck
<GOOD> Not in terms of difficulty but in terms of where the actual hell do I go
<GOOD> Hideo Kojima:
<GOOD> Oh I got an ending
<GOOD> It seems like the easiest ending to get but still
<GOOD> It's an ending
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I'm also just like, lost in the city
<GOOD> I found the safe bed and I found 1 of the 2 map locations
<GOOD> And now I'm just wandering around blindly
<GOOD> Because idk where to go from here
<GOOD> I mean I'm probably not getting any ending if I can't figure out where I'm going
<GOOD> I feel like I've almost explored everywhere in the city now
<GOOD> And I haven't found much of interest except some gods
<GOOD> I fumbled asking them questions tho
<GOOD> Oh yeah
<GOOD> I haven't been able to do anything here yet except loot tho
<GOOD> And murder babies
<GOOD> The enemies here have been shockingly easy and I'm fairly sure it's because I completely broke the game earlier today by accident
<GOOD> I got a broken weapon, a broken ability and I did look up a short guide and got a broken item
<GOOD> Because empty scrolls are strangely unintuitive
<GOOD> I need souls?
<GOOD> I mean the Empty Scroll gave me an Angelic Soul because I told it to does that count
<GOOD> The rest of the stuff I broke the game with was an accident tho
<GOOD> Yea I have no idea about any of that
<GOOD> I'm not even sure if anyone has talked to me about the city yet
<GOOD> Let alone souls or anything
<GOOD> I did tho
<GOOD> I've been going between the old city and new city all day
<GOOD> Well not new, present
<GOOD> I've slept in 2 beds there
<GOOD> 1 was a coin flip, 1 was safe apparently
<GOOD> Well the safe one was in the present
<GOOD> The unsafe one was in the past
<GOOD> I failed the past one but I just got attacked by a mannequin that I butchered
<GOOD> What dream
<GOOD> I slept in there in the present
<GOOD> So that checks out
<GOOD> That feels like a strange way to have mandatory progression
<GOOD> Still a strange amount of
<GOOD> Whatever that even falls under
<GOOD> I mean yeah I'm still mad that fire can't cauterise wounds and alcohol can't stop infections
<GOOD> And that Dash is something you have to pick 1 character and 1 specific answer at the start to start with
<GOOD> But yeah the game is kinda broken now, I've been eating everything alive by just using En Garde-->hacking them apart with Miasma
<GOOD> Like no enemy so far has stopped me doing that except Iron Shakespeare
<GOOD> And I'm very very close to being able to just shred his arms in 2 turns and eat him alive, if only I could have had that Outlander dude join the party
<GOOD> I feel like that should have been in the original lmfao
<GOOD> Apart from Ending E
<GOOD> Because like I haven't heard anything about this god stuff
<GOOD> I mean I've heard about god stuff but like
<GOOD> I've kinda kept my nose clean on sacrificing people to gods
<GOOD> And I barely know any of the lore or what any of the ancient city implies
<GOOD> I'm just mildly unsettled by the music in the past city
<GOOD> Wait he can be aluve
<GOOD> I kinda wish that the dev had patched this game more Instead of doing Termina after
<GOOD> Like Termina is probably good but this game is
<GOOD> Well not bad but it feels like it wasn't playtested sometimes
<GOOD> It's very non descript and I've found a crashing bug a few times
<GOOD> Is this where I get the info about the gods from or something because I'm ngl I read all the dialogue and I still didn't see anything about these souls
<GOOD> And I haven't even killed any NPCs yet
<GOOD> Except that torturer guy ig
<GOOD> I kinda wish that dream was just a rest in a bed, past or pressnt in the city thing
<GOOD> Or just it happens to you randomly walking around the past city
<GOOD> Also I assume all that's left is like 4 or 5 boss fights consecutively
<GOOD> Because there doesn't seem to be much further to go area wise
<GOOD> Like I've explored everywhere that isn't inside the god temple
<GOOD> Or whatever it is
<GOOD> Also I now have Leg Sweep so I can Ambush someone, break their legs on the free turn while severing their arms or whatever appendage and then murder them
<GOOD> Also I am out of healing items and don't have one of those healing rings
<GOOD> I also cannot find any respawning enemies
<GOOD> This is pretty concerning
<GOOD> I have found 1 singular green herb so far
<GOOD> It's hilarious how poorly distributed they are
<GOOD> Also I have no idea what I'm doing but I haven't attacked the giant purple lump in the Catacombs yet
<GOOD> I think that and triggering the boss fight are literally my only options rn
<GOOD> I haven't encountered it
<GOOD> I assume it helps with Mind but like
<GOOD> I've just been feeding alcohol to my dog and when the child is getting stressed out I'm just like
<GOOD> I haven't made her smoke opium yet but when the tobacco runs out that also sounds like a sound option
<GOOD> I also tried to make the dog smoke but it didn't understand how
<GOOD> Why is everything in FaH so specific
<GOOD> Like why did I need to pick Mercenary to dash in this game, why are some rlly useful key things locked to different classes
<GOOD> I guarantee if I didn't have dash this game would be genuinely insufferable
<GOOD> Because it was before I got it
<GOOD> (Also I think the ghosts are rlly dumb)
<GOOD> That's just a personal gripe but I think they're stupid
<GOOD> Like they haven't appeared in more than 1 area and they literally just serve to be like can you run past this enemy or hit it with a cursed weapon
<GOOD> The white prowler dude is my least favourite enemy so far tho
<GOOD> Exactly like in dark souls
<GOOD> Which is why New Londo is dogshit
<GOOD> I kinda wish you could just talk ghosts down
<GOOD> And that they didn't inflict the worst status in the game immediately
<GOOD> Also I can't tell if the sword that's talking to me is draining my sanity or just being an annoying bitch
<GOOD> I'm erring on the side of the latter
<GOOD> It's a very punishing game for experimentation imo
<GOOD> Without dash it's sluggish and progress is slow going, and save points are very very annoying early on
<GOOD> Like if we're doing a like Dark Souls thing it's like if bonfires were more spread out, were less obvious and had a 50/50 chance to explode upon lighting them
<GOOD> Especially the Tortur one that was just rude of them
<GOOD> This game is like Dark Souls if it was less player input based
<GOOD> Or more finicky ig
<GOOD> Because a lot of enemies can be disarmed through very very very specific flowcharts
<GOOD> And if you don't do the flowchart you take horrible amounts of damage and status
<GOOD> Or if you miss which has happened suprisingly often
<GOOD> Nah I slept in the bed
<GOOD> Because it was the first save point in the whole game
<GOOD> And it killed me instantly
<GOOD> It wouldn't actually
<GOOD> Because the first save point being unsafe is very odd
<GOOD> Especially since the other first save point is safe, but only 1 time
<GOOD> I mean taking player agency wholly out of your hands to make that point is very strange
<GOOD> I almost lost like half an hour of progress today because I used a biased coin to try and save and it came up as double Tails
<GOOD> I like the one time Hollow Knight did it
<GOOD> That one was funny
<GOOD> Both because it actually led you to a cool area and didn't immediately kill you
<GOOD> Also fuck the Night Crawler it's still the worst enemy
<GOOD> It's so annoying
<GOOD> Why would I play the sequel to the game first
<GOOD> I barely even knew there was a sequel
<GOOD> I had already bought it by that point iirc
<GOOD> And I don't remember them saying that
<GOOD> Ok but I didn't know that
<GOOD> Because I haven't played it
<GOOD> I was recommended it by a different friend
<GOOD> She described it as Like Berserk but I should have taken it as a red flag when she said it's like Earthbound also
<GOOD> Quirky Earthbound inspired indie RPG
<GOOD> And it certainly is like Berserk
<GOOD> Because 5 seconds in I had NSFW on my screen
<GOOD> And 10 seconds in I had other NSFW on my screen because I died
<GOOD> Like I literally rocked up to the first room of the first dungeon and encountered a guard immediately and it was just
<GOOD> Idk why about half of the enemies in this game if not more are naked tho
<GOOD> Like you didn't have to do that to tell me you're a mature game
<GOOD> The reason I immediately got frustrated with the game was because it felt like it treated the stuff it presented very immaturely at first
<GOOD> It reminded me of the worst part of Berserk which was the start
<GOOD> It felt so non-impactful
<GOOD> And it still does tbh I hate the guards being the first enemy
<GOOD> The guards and night prowler are my least favourite aesthetically and mechanically, respectively
<GOOD> Also it made me uncomfortable but like, not in the horror way
<GOOD> I just didn't like it
<GOOD> Bad intro to the game
<GOOD> Oh also in general I get triggered or at least grossed out by NSFW shit but that hasn't played into the horror of this game yet
<GOOD> Which is suprising
<GOOD> Unreasonably upset about this
<GOOD> Holy shit, Fear and Hunger got a Golden Age arc
<GOOD> Yea I was just annoyed because literally the first fucking enemy is just
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> The original does
<GOOD> So I assume so
<GOOD> The original also has a very game breaking mechanic that if you have it you just win most encounters by holding Y on the overworld
<GOOD> It's very funny
<GOOD> Yeah my friend told me and I thought he was lying
<GOOD> Ugh this Toriyama shit is hitting too hard
<GOOD> I love installing MtG arena and then immediately getting cooked by my friend
<GOOD> A lot of very fun and very balanced mechanics like take 10 hits from a 1/1 token and you lose the game and take 1 hit from a 1/1 token and you lose your blocker
<GOOD> Maybe I should just not play
<GOOD> It's balanced when I have a shit deck with no good blockers and can't build a better one
<GOOD> And I don't see jumping to the defense of Deathtouch
<GOOD> Or the combination of the 2
<GOOD> The very fun instant that gives deathtouch to anything for 1 black cost
<GOOD> Yea I'm just not gonna bother, the level of disruption in the game is super low and it just feels like I can't do shit
<GOOD> +gacha mechanics where I pull on packs that I don't know the contents of or what I need isn't fun
<GOOD> And learning absolutely everything about the game which is probably gonna be required to play is not gonna be interesting
<GOOD> I mean yugioh is something I already know
<GOOD> It just feels a lot more sluggish
<GOOD> Like I haven't successfully stopped a single thing happening yet
<GOOD> I've just been doing things and letting my opponent do things because I have no disruption
<GOOD> It has basically just been trading blows at this point
<GOOD> I am using the starter goblin deck rn
<GOOD> And nothing ever gets off the ground
<GOOD> Which is always fun
<GOOD> Like yeah I just made a bunch of goblin tokens, I can't buff them because my hugely expensive fuckoff beatstick can't also be used this turn and if I summoned it last turn it gets killed
<GOOD> My friend made some random Rat deck and is beating my ass with it
<GOOD> Deathtouch + poison is absolute murder because I literally can't do a thing about it
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Still isn't good enough
<GOOD> I brick constantly because afaik the only cards in my deck that actually look for cards is Scry
<GOOD> And Scry seems ass
<GOOD> Pay some lands on 1 specific card to maybe not fuck yourself over next turn
<GOOD> Which you can't do if you brick
<GOOD> I don't really like, see the purpose it seems insanely down to RNG, moreso than other card games
<GOOD> You can't get as many cards so your minimisation of RNG fucking you over is less
<GOOD> Scry doesn't actually do anything unless you want the card on top
<GOOD> But you can just draw the card again lmfao
<GOOD> Unless it's the only copy in your deck
<GOOD> Like hmmmm I will put this way too expensive card at the bottom of my deck to not brick my hand<--about to draw another, even more useless card
<GOOD> I've played a while a bit ago and am trying again now
<GOOD> Same issues as before since the game seems largely down to what I draw rather than how I play
<GOOD> Like in YGO half of the cards get you where you need to be
<GOOD> Deckbuilding is based around stopping and starting that
<GOOD> It's an RNG minimiser
<GOOD> I said it was unfun
<GOOD> And based more on RNG and not immediately having your hand get fucked up
<GOOD> Like YGO bricks are so much less common even though there isn't a Mulligan rule
<GOOD> But then again if you draw into like 1 Droll, 2 Nibs and an Ash
<GOOD> You can still probably start something off the 5th card
<GOOD> 4 handtraps and him and you're set
<GOOD> Or like, 1 Dinosaur Excavation
<GOOD> Then you start murdering babies and it all makes sense
<GOOD> I mean I imagine the experimentation in MtG is just how can I actually get to the giant fuckoff setup I get after a billion turns of land setting and trading
<GOOD> *assuming you draw into the right cards
<GOOD> I fucking wish I could just, look at a deck and make the deck
<GOOD> I want to make fish
<GOOD> I want the fish deck and to fish
<GOOD> But my friend is like noooo let's gentleman to making some random fuckoff deck while I have more game knowledge than you
<GOOD> No I mean like
<GOOD> The gentleman was let's just make decks
<GOOD> Which is a horrible idea in a card game with crafting resources
<GOOD> I don't know the game how am I making a deck without knowing how to make a deck
<GOOD> Yes, which is why I'm pissed off my friend is doing this
<GOOD> It's a thing in every building game known to man because you need a baseline of what decks exist to fucking play the game and having some sort of agreement to not fucking know how decks work while making decks is stupid as fuck
<GOOD> I'm pressed because let's just have fun/hop into the game doesn't work
<GOOD> Like bro is suggesting I just throw lands and cards into a deck and then use that deck
<GOOD> I really wish I could just tell him no
<GOOD> Instead I will just quit because I can only bitch and not be confrontational
<GOOD> I feel like there's something there
<GOOD> They hate gay people
<GOOD> Doctor, disable my yaoi inhibitors
<GOOD> Is it bad to say that Toriyama's death has made me want to look at Sonic more
<GOOD> Like damn Super Sonic I didn't know you were like that
<GOOD> Who tf did Robotnik blow up to make him do that
<GOOD> Also I just realised I unironically said I should expose myself to more Sonic media
<GOOD> I started at Pokemon tho so I'm going up in the ladder
<GOOD> I like when Sonic looks small
<GOOD> He's very silly
<GOOD> This is so fucking funny
<GOOD> They got gen wars in here too...
<GOOD> You can see the vitriol of the artist bleed into Sonic's expression
<GOOD> But yea I like how Sonic looks in the games, also when he just doesn't have a mouth that's kinda cute
<GOOD> Oh no am I some sort of Sonic genwunner for liking Classic way more
<GOOD> Hyper Sonic iirc is white
<GOOD> Or something like that
<GOOD> I don't remember I just remember he's the one in CD or smth and he's cool
<GOOD> Following in Toriyama's footsteps
<GOOD> How is Super Sonic 2 different aesthetically
<GOOD> Are his spines different?
<GOOD> Or is it just eyes
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> He does check this shit out
<GOOD> Also this render looks strange and I can't tell why
<GOOD> Oh shit Hyper Sonic is white with rainbow?
<GOOD> That's so cool
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I'm ngl I don't like this one
<GOOD> I've never been a fan of the cube, black + either red or blue lines aesthetic
<GOOD> The cyber one
<GOOD> It's just a weird thing I have
<GOOD> Like the aesthetic just reminds me of this
<GOOD> What is fleetway
<GOOD> They made him Broly instead of Goku
<GOOD> Cyber Sonic just makes me think of Sonic.exe
<GOOD> Even though I know more about exe than Sonic and know they aren't related at all
<GOOD> What the fuck
<GOOD> Holy shit it's Espio
<GOOD> Ourple Sonic
<GOOD> He got hit with a road painter
<GOOD> If he had all 7 would he be brown or smth
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I have played this one and yeah that design fucks
<GOOD> I love the Black Knight
<GOOD> Hyper seems the coolest rn
<GOOD> Big ass spines
<GOOD> Why can't I just find like the actual Hyper Sonic Sprites
<GOOD> They're all DS sprites
<GOOD> Found them I think
<GOOD> He looks cool
<GOOD> Mentioning Sonic just plays random sound clips from this video in my mind
<GOOD> It's such a stupid video
<GOOD> I saw Archie evil sonic once I found that funny
<GOOD> Evil fucked up greaser Sonic
<GOOD> I used to watch localised shonen like Inazuma Eleven and Ultimate Muscle lmao, at least when I was a bit older
<GOOD> As a young kid I loved In the Night Garden
<GOOD> Holy fuck what was that
<GOOD> I heard 64 Zoo Lane and it felt like my brain just exploded out of my skull
<GOOD> I haven't had that feeling in a loooooong time
<GOOD> It's already in there
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> Horrid Henry is always a banger even if it's not on Cbeebies
<GOOD> I think I used to watch a show with 2 clay cats called Miu and Miao
<GOOD> And I remember the intro distinctly
<GOOD> Oh also when I felt brave I'd go on CBBC and watch Trapped
<GOOD> That show freaked me tf out
<GOOD> And Jungle Run
<GOOD> The one level where there's that furry werewolf dude gave me nightmares
<GOOD> I should really have glasses on when I read these messages I almost pinged mods
<GOOD> I was just like HUH
<GOOD> Late night brain is broken
<GOOD> That tickles some sort of memory up there
<GOOD> Idk what tho
<GOOD> I do remember rastamouse tho
<GOOD> Oh and Mr Maker
<GOOD> Something Special is a classic everyone remembers it
<GOOD> Uhhhh there's another I forgot
<GOOD> Iconicles that's iy
<GOOD> I vaguely remember it
<GOOD> I am a rectangle clears
<GOOD> I used to watch this really poorly animated CITV show called Samsam too iirc
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Fun fact I am friends with one of the actors in an episode of that show
<GOOD> Well not friends
<GOOD> But like I know them
<GOOD> Grizzly tales for gruesome kids
<GOOD> Honestly a pretty cool one, it had poor animation but it helped it more than hurt
<GOOD> A series of cautionary tails, for lovers of *squeaaaaaaaaaam*
<GOOD> It wasn't that bad
<GOOD> I never watched much on CBBC
<GOOD> If I wanted big kid stuff I watched Kix
<GOOD> Which is where I watched Ultimate Muscle
<GOOD> This thing elicits an inexplicable amount of recognition for me
<GOOD> Despite me not knowing what it is or where it's from
<GOOD> I'm certain I've seen this thing and watched the show it's from too
<GOOD> Oh I also loved Bear in the Big Blue House
<GOOD> Like look at this fella
<GOOD> I also used to watch the Super Mario Bros show
<GOOD> But idk which one
<GOOD> It was animated with the old ass looking designs
<GOOD> Idk if they had the live action segments tho
<GOOD> I vaguely also remember when I was older but my brother was very young we watched a show about some old dude on a boat with a dog called Salty
<GOOD> I remember the intro for some reason but not anything else
<GOOD> Oh also Grandpa in my Pocket existed
<GOOD> Found it
<GOOD> It's called Old Jack's Boat and it's like 10 years old
<GOOD> It's so low quality I'm crying
<GOOD> You just know this was on one of those shitty DVD cases that snaps rlly easily and it's made out of crap yellow plastic
<GOOD> Or your copy is charity shop and is already splintered
<GOOD> Or those cases that had handles on the top for some reason
<GOOD> But they never like, closed properly so you'd always have it misaligned or forcefully pressed together
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> Oh my god what is it called
<GOOD> Brain blast but idfk what it's called
<GOOD> I googled it
<GOOD> It's called ooglies
<GOOD> That was such a huge blast for me man I loved that show
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I don't remember the name bc I didn't watch it either
<GOOD> LMAO
<GOOD> Twilight if it was in Wolvo
<GOOD> The wolf shadows are funny af
<GOOD> The crunchy ass images of these old shows are always funny
<GOOD> My brother loves that one
<GOOD> I always loved the Jungle Run/Crystal Maze genre of game show tho
<GOOD> My dad also showed me Knightmare which was pretty fun to watch
<GOOD> Is that what it was called
<GOOD> I also remember this other Cbeebies show with bald ass purple puppets
<GOOD> I just don't remember the name
<GOOD> This is vaguely familiar to me
<GOOD> But I remember Splatalot a lot more
<GOOD> Also when my dad let me I'd watch robot wars
<GOOD> Because they're cool as fuck
<GOOD> I REMEMBER THIS ONE
<GOOD> This and Max Steel
<GOOD> I remember bc he had like these hexagon things he could slot into a projector(?)
<GOOD> The intro is an exposition dump
<GOOD> For the time this animation went crazy
<GOOD> Also that one dude with the gargoyle was funny af
<GOOD> I also remember Redakai Conquer the Kairu
<GOOD> This design still goes crazy
<GOOD> And Gormiti
<GOOD> Wait what do you mean this show has a youtube channel that reuploads full episodes
<GOOD> And it uploaded the last one 2 days ago
<GOOD> What if Spooky Spoon was called Freaky Spoon
<GOOD> Eventually I want a picture of me that has the aura this image conveys
<GOOD> I love how he's very obviously just in a public park
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Because they replaced Jungle Run for it
<GOOD> My friend loves Lucifer so I'm sending her this
<GOOD> And yes they had to collect monkey statues to keep the mouth of the temple open
<GOOD> And iirc they like, drained out or smth as a timer
<GOOD> And there were red monkeys
<GOOD> I honestly could not tell you
<GOOD> These are the only 2 images of him I have
<GOOD> Oh and this
<GOOD> It looks like me wearing my lab coat
<GOOD> The audio being drowned out by the music is rlly funny to me
<GOOD> Also the image they chose for the numbertaker looks like a mugshot
<GOOD> I like how with the Puzzler they're just like he has a twisted mind
<GOOD> Neurodivergent rep The Puzzler
<GOOD> Also The Numbertaker looks like a soyjak crossed with a Year 4 Maths Teacher
<GOOD> Also also, I looked into Splatalot and apparently like 5 years ago they made a spinoff called Smashalot where they just demolished the set on screen in front of an audience of kids that probably grew up with it
<GOOD> That's mad funny ngl
<GOOD> I should probably sleep but I think I watched Ra Ra the Noisy Lion
<GOOD> And Tinga Tinga Tales
<GOOD> Anyway gn
<GOOD> Idrk what Dragon's Dogma is about
<GOOD> They got him unfortunately
<GOOD> What was the absolutely taking over incident at your 16 year old high school?
<GOOD> Never clicking on this video
<GOOD> The fury I would experience would kill me
<GOOD> I feel like the easiest thing to do is be like omg co links and hand traps!!!! These turns take 4 billion years!!! And then Yugi wins by topdecking Exodia or smth
<GOOD> It's so funny how much I've seen Madame Web talked about and how long it's been out, and I still don't know a single thing about it
<GOOD> Sign of a peak bad movie
<GOOD> Morbius wasn't that interesting to watch but I have a feeling that Madame Web would be funnier
<GOOD> Like I was actually falling asleep in Morbius' climax
<GOOD> Pirated on a movie night w friends
<GOOD> We had a thing where every Thursday evening was bad movie night
<GOOD> Way ahead of you
<GOOD> We started with bad live action adaptations
<GOOD> You're gonna have to be more specific
<GOOD> Best investment of my life
<GOOD> If it's any consolation I like your hair and your necklace is pretty
<GOOD> I have the opposite where my hair can look washed for like 2-3 days
<GOOD> But I feel icky so I wash daily
<GOOD> I put in none
<GOOD> Yea I feel like curly hair is a huge thing to maintain
<GOOD> I just kinda let my hair do its thing
<GOOD> I would dislike Pends if Qli wasn't fucking awesome
<GOOD> Oh also Performapals were one of my first decks so
<GOOD> My actual first was Geargi
<GOOD> The playground wasn't ready for Geargiaccelerator
<GOOD> I'd say it's a double compliment
<GOOD> Please god don't make this OC make me look like a 15 year old Newgrounds user
<GOOD> I like drawing them so much
<GOOD> I may axe the tail because idk because I wanted to fill some space on the back and I like feesh
<GOOD> I love their design
<GOOD> I wanna draw more but headache
<GOOD> ALSO HE'S HERE
<GOOD> MY CREATURE BABY IS HERE
<GOOD> THE NOIIIIIIIISE
<GOOD> He's such an asshole
<GOOD> I also drew some other doodles
<GOOD> They're so fun to draw I think this is finally the OC I wanna attach to myself
<GOOD> Ye it's my childhood teddy bear
<GOOD> The concept is that they shift and split designs based on how they feel which is why I'm drawing this
<GOOD> The Noise's boss fight replacement made me ugly laugh and lose my breath
<GOOD> Stonetoss got doxxed lmao
<GOOD> >open thread
>1/99
<GOOD> Oh also no more Mandela Catalogue, Noise Pizza Tower and FNF released I think
<GOOD> As well as all the other abhorrent DSMP stuff
<GOOD> Busy ass day
<GOOD> (Mandela Catalogue also falls under this)
<GOOD> Was the most suprising thing FNF
<GOOD> Because ngl it suprised me most too
<GOOD> Creator is yucky
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Do you want the doc in DMs or would you rather not be involved
<GOOD> I don't blame you, so much stuff like this recently
<GOOD> I feel so bad for Pastra
<GOOD> He's such a nice fella
<GOOD> I never watched Chugga but I can never forget the most iconic Pikmin clip of all time
<GOOD> Agree
<GOOD> I have a weird inexplicable chest and shoulder pain
<GOOD> That's fun
<GOOD> I might cop a PSP sometime soon
<GOOD> Or try and find my old one
<GOOD> Good times
<GOOD> Or maybe a PS Vita that has better specs right
<GOOD> I do wanna homebrew it yeah
<GOOD> Maybe I'll cop one for my birthday
<GOOD> I just want it for the PSP MGS games and ig emulating other consoles
<GOOD> I wonder if ppl have made emulators for the vita
<GOOD> I UNLOCKED MULTIPLAYER PIZZA GAME RAAAAA
<GOOD> THE NOIIIIIIIISE
<GOOD> I played this on showdown the other day
<GOOD> It was kind of funny but my friend beat my ass with Mega Milotic
<GOOD> I love The Noise so much
<GOOD> I didn't think I could feel hyped over this character but I did
<GOOD> Apparently all it needs is a Super form and I'm good to go
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> Good investment
<GOOD> Little Big Planet goes crazy
<GOOD> Pitches from ppl that don't know what they're talking about always annoy me istg
<GOOD> Like it's just like {media you like}! And it literally never is
<GOOD> My dad once saw some sad looking indie game with a fox or smth and he was immediately like you would like this game, it's your type of game and it's just like the games you play
<GOOD> It just reminds me of the miserable mfs when a game doesn't have a gun or a ball
<GOOD> Nah it was depressing
<GOOD> You played as a fox and made sure your fox babies didn't get poached by hunters or smth
<GOOD> It seemed mostly narrative driven
<GOOD> My attention span is bad and I haven't done a thing about it
<GOOD> I'm getting into cryptids again
<GOOD> This may be bad
<GOOD> As long as I stay away from skinwalkers I should be fine tho
<GOOD> Or cool hats
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> So retro..m
<GOOD> I wanna do one of these trace edits eventually
<GOOD> They're so funny
<GOOD> I remember the figure skating with Perfect Chaos
<GOOD> And the boss fights
<GOOD> This game is making me feel like a fucking idiot ngl
<GOOD> Nothing like random easy JRPG puzzles to make me feel so so so stupid
<GOOD> FF7
<GOOD> It certainly feels like it should be
<GOOD> But like they just haven't given me info on what to do with what I have so lmao
<GOOD> Surely it isn't as complicated as I'm making it
<GOOD> It's me trying to figure out the puzzle
<GOOD> Shinra
<GOOD> It's a 4 letter passcode it should not be this hard
<GOOD> Why would I
<GOOD> I need to get it first try for the special gift
<GOOD> The dude
<GOOD> The dude wants a 4 letter code and if I get it first try I get a keycard AND a mystery prize
<GOOD> He's a mayor librarian dude
<GOOD> There are books in 4 different libraries and 1 in each library is out of place, all of them are numbered
<GOOD> That is literally all the information I have so far except the numbers 2, 10, 16 and 4
<GOOD> New plans for urban planning: 10
Mako Energy and the rise in life forms: 2
Ranks and extended use of Mako Weaponry: 4
Modern History of Midgar Space Program vol. 1: 16
<GOOD> 32
<GOOD> Added
<GOOD> I assume it is Mako but I literally don't care about guessing
<GOOD> I wanna figure this out
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Oh my god that's fucking
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> I did it with the wrong message because I assumed this TV actually meant shit
<GOOD> And wasn't just a completely pointless thing
<GOOD> That's a boring ass puzzle
<GOOD> It's still a dumb puzzle I'm ngl
<GOOD> Like yeah the code is the character number in the place in the book title that's the same as the book number of the only book that's out of place in 4 respective libraries
<GOOD> Like that is just
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I literally put the numbers into a cipher
<GOOD> And used the statement on the TV asking about the Materials as the thing to look into the sentence if because they drew so much attention to it
<GOOD> And the titles of the libraries since they did that too
<GOOD> What a waste of time
<GOOD> Oh that was an hour of my time
<GOOD> I'm just gonna not play that kinda annoyed me
<GOOD> This game is fucking awesome wth
<GOOD> Am I actually fucking stuck rn
<GOOD> How do I get out
<GOOD> Awesome first game over
<GOOD> Gj game for locking me in an area with an enemy I can't beat
<GOOD> Nvm the wipe took me back away from the snake
<GOOD> That was uh
<GOOD> Unfortunate ig
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> AAAAAAAAAA
<GOOD> I'm so cooked
<GOOD> Hm I could watch dune 2 today but idk if I need to have watched dune 1
<GOOD> Get out while you still can
<GOOD> Oh you're in for a ride lol
<GOOD> Yugioh having disruption and activation timings already makes it like a hundred times more needlessly complex
<GOOD> If you have any questions I have the old ass memories buried up there
<GOOD> Yea Master Duel can be a bit much if you don't know MD too
<GOOD> Tree of Might had a manga?
<GOOD> I didn't think any of the movies except Super Hero did
<GOOD> No Janemba manga :((
<GOOD> He's in my DB villain top 3
<GOOD> I cannot get off the floor
<GOOD> What is this and why do i want it
<GOOD> It seems like it but at the same time I think Earthbound is the most surreal a game has gotten for me thus far
<GOOD> So this seems like a big big jump
<GOOD> LMFAO WHAT
<GOOD> That's funny
<GOOD> Maybe I should buy Hylics 1 for like 1 then if I like it buy 2
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> I might leave it on my wishlist for now then
<GOOD> Because I kinda want MGRR and they're similar prices rn and I don't wanna spend too much
<GOOD> If I do I get carried away
<GOOD> Is it intentionally aimless then or is there some method or meaning in it?
<GOOD> Fair enough
<GOOD> I meant moreso in like, can I turn my brain off partially and enjoy the game without looking too deep
<GOOD> I might cop it and MGRR then
<GOOD> Uh huh.
<GOOD> I will keep that in mind(?)
<GOOD> I don't really know why cups of water are a thing
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> It doesn't look like one
<GOOD> I might play Hylics 2 before 1
<GOOD> Yea but I heard it's worse
<GOOD> So I didn't wanna sour my opinion of 2 with 1
<GOOD> I don't doubt it
<GOOD> Like an hour into MGRR
<GOOD> Yeah I see streetpass stuff suprisingly often
<GOOD> I wish my 3DS was properly repaired
<GOOD> >more representation
>it's Valorant
<GOOD> They seem to be in an uncharacteristically good mood this morning
<GOOD> Also I'm losing my shit how is this not satire
<GOOD> The Crow Mauler doodle is reaaaaal
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I couldn't rlly tell what the weapon.... is
<GOOD> So I stuck with a kinda studded half-spike
<GOOD> Kinda like a kanabo but studded
<GOOD> Just do what Raiden MGRR does where he attaches the katana to his foot
<GOOD> So his leg swings have more range and force
<GOOD> It's like a slot for his katana
<GOOD> I've spent the whole day drawing man wtf
<GOOD> I'm cooking
<GOOD> Lmao stupid child getting crow mauled
<GOOD> She will face the curse of flock of crows
<GOOD> Is it worse than F&H 1
<GOOD> I mean if it's hopeful that kinda just means it will be a bit scarier when bad things do happen
<GOOD> Which is good
<GOOD> Idk I wasn't sad about the first one but that's probably because I didn't have to do anything to survive
<GOOD> My character is currently squeaky clean
<GOOD> Atp I've literally only attacked in self defense too like
<GOOD> Oh wait nvm I'm not clean
<GOOD> I brought the kid along literally just to be an extra target for attacks
<GOOD> Do you know Berserk, because Fear and Hunger 1 is kinda like that
<GOOD> Idk about Termina
<GOOD> It's probably more like every arc after the first where they're like oh wait Guts is a human being also
<GOOD> Berserk is a manga not a game
<GOOD> Sounds a lot better
<GOOD> 1 is just watching gross stuff happen usually and then the game's difficulty curve falls off a cliff
<GOOD> The survival stuff rarely seems to come into it bc like
<GOOD> You don't spend enough time for hunger or mind to be an issue
<GOOD> And most injuries that aren't just superficial are run ending anyway
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Drink alcohol/smoke and eat food, that's about it
<GOOD> The issue mostly comes in with the bullshit status effects
<GOOD> Yeah I gave a child a pipe lmfao
<GOOD> She had to chill tf out
<GOOD> I genuinely don't think that will ever happen naturally if you aren't stupid af
<GOOD> Like, literally just feed them alcohol and you're good
<GOOD> Yeah I'm really not a fan of just, losing limbs
<GOOD> They don't feel like good punishments
<GOOD> And infection sucks
<GOOD> Like oml fuck infection idc if there's like 1 guaranteed green herb in the whole game
<GOOD> (Ruin also sucks)
<GOOD> Yeah, and being hit in F&H can be devastating
<GOOD> Like, 60% of the time it's devastating
<GOOD> Depending on the enemy ofc but like lmao
<GOOD> Yep, you get infections, severed limbs, broken limbs, removed eyes
<GOOD> And a lot of these are just insanely harmful
<GOOD> Like, blindness makes a character so damn useless and if it's your party leader it's just over
<GOOD> Infection is overly punishing because you can't cauterise wounds or anything and REQUIRE 1 specific very rare item in a short time frame to cure it
<GOOD> Broken and severed limbs in F&H 1 are like, only salvageable if you didn't need the limb that was damaged
<GOOD> Pretty much, after a few rooms the character just keels over and dies
<GOOD> And you can't do much about it
<GOOD> You go to a dungeon to rescue a guy
<GOOD> In 1 at least
<GOOD> Also like the first enemy in 1 can just take your arm off turn 1 which is neat
<GOOD> And kill you turn 2
<GOOD> I mean approaching guards in 1 is kinda inevitable without dash
<GOOD> Because stealth is really funky
<GOOD> It's not rlly stealth it's just that if you walk behind them they won't see you
<GOOD> It's very rudimentary
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> You also spend a very long time just running from people
<GOOD> Which means Escape Plan and Dash are almost necessary for the start of the game which is only accessible through 1 character and only if you know what's going on
<GOOD> I never bothered with that fucker
<GOOD> They were just an asshole so I held off on killing them and left
<GOOD> I kinda wanted Ragnavaldr but idk how to substitute the child for him
<GOOD> But tbh the other 3 party members are fucking busted rn so it doesn't matter, she's just a pinecone pig carrier
<GOOD> Who knew a free turn + 2 turns per turn on 2 different party members would be strong
<GOOD> I use Moonless, D'Arce and me
<GOOD> And the child but she's only good for using items and attacking weak body parys
<GOOD> What a happy famil-
<GOOD> I just love imagining them in Funger
<GOOD> Only Marcille would be scared in the slightest
<GOOD> They'd spitroast him on his own maul with some green herbs
<GOOD> Unless Chilchuck stopped them
<GOOD> Though Chilchuck would also probably be drunk off his shits with the density of alcohol there
<GOOD> I need to read more Dunmeshi
<GOOD> I hate third wheeling
<GOOD> So I guess I'm a unicycle now
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> Also MGRR beaten
<GOOD> Good ass game
<GOOD> What DLC
<GOOD> How do I access it
<GOOD> I CAN PLAY AS A DOG!?
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Must draw new creatures but  also must take a break...
<GOOD> I know this sounds stupid but do Sonic 1, 2 and 3 and Knuckles have any sort of generally recommended QoL mods or patches that exist for a better experience
<GOOD> Obviously for FF7 it was a bit more cut and dry but idk about Sonic since the games are platformers and therefore doesn't need much tweaking
<GOOD> Ok ty
<GOOD> I mean it says I just need an APK
<GOOD> Shouldn't be hard to get my hands on
<GOOD> Idk if APK files run on PC well tho because I've never done that
<GOOD> Uh Sonic 1 forever has
<GOOD> A lot of options
<GOOD> Damn these special stages are scary lmfao
<GOOD> I should install some MC mods and play it
<GOOD> Nothing intensive tho
<GOOD> Wowee I hate death egg zone
<GOOD> That's crazy
<GOOD> 2
<GOOD> Anyway sonic 2 done
<GOOD> Cool supa sonic ending too
<GOOD> Probably gonna hold off on Sonic 3 and Knuckles for a few hours tho
<GOOD> Got it, ty!
<GOOD> I'm going to a zoo later this week yippee
<GOOD> Cute
<GOOD> Oh right roblox
<GOOD> I should install it properly
<GOOD> Drip
<GOOD> I started Hylics 2
<GOOD> I'm very confused
<GOOD> Ough headache, I chilled a bit too much
<GOOD> A proper HUH
<GOOD> I can't believe they'd put CQC from Metal Gear in another game
<GOOD> I tilted at Arch Tempered Kushala ig
<GOOD> And then I was like wait I can just stop playing and never played MHW again
<GOOD> I have no idea what gives me points so I just walk around and kill shit
<GOOD> This also reminds me that I haven't made progress in GU
<GOOD> Yeah I'm aware
<GOOD> I didn't even get past the 4 kings or whatever they're called bc their quests wouldn't unlock
<GOOD> I think I killed 2 of them and then their quests just stopped appearing
<GOOD> Maybe even 1
<GOOD> Yea idk which quest that IS tho because I have so many quests
<GOOD> And I unfortunately only do quests I enjoy doing
<GOOD> Which is very unfortunate because most of the ones it wants you to do are boring as piss
<GOOD> Fighting the crab with aerial hammer makes it all worth it
<GOOD> Sea of Thieves players:
<GOOD> I have collected all the Chaos emeralds in 3 and Knuckles through the power of cheating because I hate permanent punishment for fucking up
<GOOD> What does the G stand for
<GOOD> Generations perhaps
<GOOD> But then they would have called it GU rank
<GOOD> They were hinting at Generations
<GOOD> It was foreshadowing
<GOOD> What does the G stand for there
<GOOD> That's like if the 4th final fantasy was called final fantasy K or something
<GOOD> This naming scheme is irking
<GOOD> They should have called it Gonster Gunter
<GOOD> I didn't click enough with most GU weapons
<GOOD> A few were fun tho
<GOOD> Forgot what my favourite was
<GOOD> I think I used aerial hammer a bunch
<GOOD> Oh I used a bow
<GOOD> I forgot the style tho
<GOOD> Oh it was Adept SnS and uhhh idk what kind of bow
<GOOD> And then aerial hammer when I knew it would work which it rarely did
<GOOD> I just never aimed with bow rlly lmao
<GOOD> You don't need to
<GOOD> You gotta be fucking kidding me
<GOOD> Mothman is my favourite cryptid but come tf on man it's too soon, less frustrating than all the other bullshit people are saying in earnest but my hearts go out to those people that need to be safe rn
<GOOD> Which one is CB
<GOOD> Also I think I used Valor bow
<GOOD> Or was it adept
<GOOD> What does Valor do on bow again I forgor
<GOOD> That rings a bell
<GOOD> Does Adept just draw the bow immediately
<GOOD> I need one of those 3DS XLs badly
<GOOD> I just don't have the money yet
<GOOD> I have a relative in Japan rn that actually understands what different game franchises and anime are
<GOOD> It's so over for my wallet
<GOOD> Oh dear I just looked at what a gachapon is
<GOOD> Am I finished
<GOOD> How much are they per turn
<GOOD> I feel this may become something I will be too obsessed with at some point
<GOOD> Oh dear
<GOOD> Why did my dog in F&H have to die :((
<GOOD> It should have been the child
<GOOD> I got 2 Funger endings in 1 hour yippee
<GOOD> Hard af bosses too I like them
<GOOD> Pikmin has fantastic dynamic battle themes
<GOOD> Assuming it means what I think it does
<GOOD> THE SAMON RUN GEAR
<GOOD> AAAAA
<GOOD> I wish I could have bought one of those salmon run bags
<GOOD> So cool
<GOOD> Korewa
<GOOD> Is that terrible tornado one punch man
<GOOD> The bargain
<GOOD> this bus is heading to Liverpool if I don't get off
<GOOD> Birthday visit!!!!
<GOOD> Nah I would never
<GOOD> I like animals more
<GOOD> And Chester already reminds me of Liverpool and Birmingham
<GOOD> Or maybe I just lump all smoggy urban cities together
<GOOD> It's a bit more quaint
<GOOD> I like the small buildings nestled in
<GOOD> Ooooo this place is nice
<GOOD> Maybe it isn't a shithole like Birmingham
<GOOD> I'll have to have a wander around someday when I get the chance
<GOOD> I just don't like being alone in big cities
<GOOD> Or in general
<GOOD> Yakuza reference
<GOOD> My friend after the new Streets of Rage game releases
<GOOD> It's so sugoi desu!!!!
<GOOD> Maybe eventually I'll be able to afford to go to Japan
<GOOD> I wonder how much Japanese I would need to know
<GOOD> Then how do you like, communicate
<GOOD> I don't imagine every place has english speakers
<GOOD> Or text mind you
<GOOD> It's probably common enough but still
<GOOD> Skibi toolet
<GOOD> I got too nervous about missing my stop so I stayed on the bottom floor of the double decker bus
<GOOD> It's not as fun
<GOOD> The bottom floor is boring
<GOOD> The top floor has the cool front window and everything
<GOOD> If I fall I fall for the sake of fun
<GOOD> Worthy sacrifice
<GOOD> I just took a train with 0 changeovers and got stressed lmao
<GOOD> Also someone on the bus just said let's let this lady out first and idk how to feel about that
<GOOD> I see elephants and I haven't even entered yet
<GOOD> So hyped
<GOOD> Great tusk irl
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> just went in the insect house
<GOOD> So many blurry butterfly photos
<GOOD> Holy shit lions are loud
<GOOD> I was a bit antsy but the free flying bat area in the dark freaked me out more
<GOOD> They were flying directly in front of and past me
<GOOD> Chester
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> That's where I'm hiding
<GOOD> I am here alone :((
<GOOD> Because I wanted to go
<GOOD> Gay grasshoppers
<GOOD> Bought Bridget GG
<GOOD> Also Bedman and ABA
<GOOD> I have no idea how to play Bedman ngl
<GOOD> Bedman isn't a mashing character it seems unfortunately
<GOOD> What are you identifying here
<GOOD> Big boat...
<GOOD> Finallly hitting the baby mode combo still feels good
<GOOD> even if its just once
<GOOD> YIPPEE 3 IN A ROW
<GOOD> Certified Bedman
<GOOD> Why am I getting pressed that I can't do a logic puzzle wtf
<GOOD> It's apparently easy as shit but I couldn't so
<GOOD> I only got katana and atari
<GOOD> Yeah I'm done man
<GOOD> The dots do not represent that
<GOOD> The sets do
<GOOD> 2
<GOOD> Ko-i
<GOOD> Unfortunately I didn't get that for Haiku
<GOOD> Because why do you pronounce Haiku as ha-i-ku
<GOOD> Even if it was, in the context of this language it wouldn't be
<GOOD> Because it isn't
<GOOD> Ko-i
<GOOD> You did add a letter
<GOOD> It's ko and i
<GOOD> 2 syllables
<GOOD> 1
<GOOD> Kow-ee
<GOOD> Take it up with Japan not me
<GOOD> Is koi-koi the same as koi fish tho
<GOOD> Then say it really slow
<GOOD> And it's like ko-i ko-i
<GOOD> Oi is, koi isn't
<GOOD> If it's the oi in koi then it's oo-i probably
<GOOD> Finally an efficient way to play Rockman 4
<GOOD> Turles... save me Turles....
<GOOD> I think I was still cis last Easter, for want of a better way of phrasing it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> So guys, have you submitted your License Trainer applications?
<GOOD> I hope I get mine this wave
<GOOD> This was my 2019 pfp because my online identity literally doesn't go further
<GOOD> I am a huge jojo fan
<GOOD> I'm back to like 2019 me, if I went back further I'd go from annoying furry hating reddit kid to indoctrinated bigot
<GOOD> I have to boymode way too much :((
<GOOD> And all I remember of 2019 me was that I was insufferable
<GOOD> I almost pretended to be cis for the joke but I decided against it
<GOOD> I mean even now I don't feel great about me so
<GOOD> Boo womp
<GOOD> I don't even know what I gotta do to be comfortable in my body tbh
<GOOD> Very unfortunate position
<GOOD> >enter store for product 
>Can only find 1 of it and it's in the women's section of the aisle ig
>no unisex or male equivalent
>get confused if I can use it or not
>leave without buying it because anxiety
<GOOD> Hair cream because I dislike razors
<GOOD> And dysphoria is a bitch
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's not for my face, I use a razor there
<GOOD> I just dislike razors for the rest
<GOOD> Because I'm not used to it
<GOOD> I'll try and get it next time ig
<GOOD> I really need to soon
<GOOD> It's been making me more and more upset
<GOOD> I just don't trust shaving as much as I trust just slapping cream on, waiting then running a sponge or smth along it
<GOOD> Plus no E or plans to take E means I kinda have to
<GOOD> Only things stopping me are the facts that I don't know whether it would actually help and the fact that it would make not coming out to my parents very hard
<GOOD> Also it's probably kinda difficult to get a hold of
<GOOD> I'm not in the US
<GOOD> How I feel about my body in general lol
<GOOD> I don't rlly know what I want except cutting the line between masc and fem as much as possible, but tbh I don't even know what that would look like or if I want that
<GOOD> It's hard to find out
<GOOD> Yeah but I don't wanna just aimlessly start that sounds like a bad idea
<GOOD> Especially with the other things I said
<GOOD> I know but I can't tell if that feels like too much for something I can solve with the stuff I was looking at
<GOOD> I should rlly start trying to voice train a little, my voice is so flat and deep rn I hate it
<GOOD> And kinda gravelly bc I talk quiet
<GOOD> Again tho, idk what I want for my voice, like I wanna make it a bit lighter and higher but not so much I present fem
<GOOD> It's hard to narrow down what I wanna sound and look like
<GOOD> Yeah I do
<GOOD> I also don't know what that sounds like tho
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I don't think that's what will help rn
<GOOD> I'll go buy the women sensitive skin one this week when I gotta shop again ig
<GOOD> Rlly sucks that gendered products that are actually unisex exist so often tho
<GOOD> Plus I hate just having no idea what I'm doing
<GOOD> I never cared about how I looked before I just accepted being ugly and having my stupid ass short hair bc my dad made me lmfao
<GOOD> So now idk anything about hair and skincare
<GOOD> Sorry
<GOOD> This video makes me ugly laugh every time I see it
<GOOD> What is Oneshot
<GOOD> It looks interesting
<GOOD> Creature
<GOOD> Almost 2000 words into my 3000 word project
<GOOD> Holy shit man lmao
<GOOD> I'm only on 29 references but yk that's fine
<GOOD> I'm aiming for a few more
<GOOD> 3000 word paper based off an original hypothesis and secondary data
<GOOD> We have to come up with our own within fairly broad prompts we can choose from
<GOOD> I chose poisons
<GOOD> Nah this creature doesn't have venoms unfortunately
<GOOD> They just have TTX and PSTs
<GOOD> So ye I'm now almost 2000 words in
<GOOD> So many papersssss
<GOOD> At least the final 500 words are easier
<GOOD> Because it's just a conclusion, an Abstract and finally the Title
<GOOD> Only 500 or so words of the tough part left
<GOOD> 22 hour Jacksepticeye video
<GOOD> I'm about to ascend to a different level of random stimuli on the other side of my screen while I do work
<GOOD> Oooooo
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> Oh right it is
<GOOD> 5 here
<GOOD> Then 6
<GOOD> Mine was B2-->XY-->ORAS-->SM
<GOOD> Then I thought I was cool for not liking what I liked as a teen
<GOOD> Then realised that was stupid around the last 2 years of SwSh's life just after Crown Tundra
<GOOD> And I haven't missed an entry since
<GOOD> Hating Pokmon because it wasn't regular show is based
<GOOD> Arcsys what are you doing
<GOOD> She is married
<GOOD> I'm 19 in like a month and a half
<GOOD> Must hurt to be that old
<GOOD> Voice training hurts
<GOOD> My throat and head hurt a bit
<GOOD> My throat is sore and I have a headache and I have a pressure there
<GOOD> I probably should but I just push too hard I think
<GOOD> I really just wanna find what voice I want to try and go for
<GOOD> I am going to the cinema later yippe
<GOOD> It's only Kung Fu Panda 4 but I figured I needed a day out
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> I was very nervous
<GOOD> Yeah I'm only using it on legs and arms
<GOOD> I should probably have bought some Aloe as well
<GOOD> Why would I
<GOOD> Every time something doesn't work just take more
<GOOD> Also my chest hurts and that's kinda annoying rn
<GOOD> Nah this happens like once a week maybe
<GOOD> I'm cooking egg noodles, Broccoli and chicken wings yippee
<GOOD> I got em reduced because they expire today
<GOOD> I don't gain any weight really tbh
<GOOD> I mean I am
<GOOD> I'm very greedy
<GOOD> You just need to eat in excess to bulk
<GOOD> And with my metabolism I'd have to eat a lot in excess
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Yummyyyy
<GOOD> Wings, broccoli and egg noodles
<GOOD> Didn't have any stir fry sauce
<GOOD> So just a teaspoon of vegetable oil
<GOOD> I think that's from a bit of overcooking on the tray
<GOOD> It darkens a bit and looks pinkish, + the lighting can make it look like that
<GOOD> Southern fried seasoning
<GOOD> Basically just a powder but it tastes alr
<GOOD> Airport, England
<GOOD> I'm crying at a comic
<GOOD> I don't think something has gotten to me in this short a time ever man
<GOOD> I don't know
<GOOD> I feel spoken to but I feel devastated
<GOOD> It's like being caught in the crossfire of someone calling themself out
<GOOD> I've had an idea of how I've wanted to visually represent myself forever and the artist expressed it visually and narratively perfectly
<GOOD> And it was only 7 or so pages long
<GOOD> I feel overwhelmed man this shit feels like the most goofy shit to crumble to but this is like a callout that hit the jenga block at the bottom of the tower
<GOOD> I'm gonna sit down ig lmfao
<GOOD> Like this is the type of visualisation I've been trying to get across to people for so long and it's probably the most base level way of showing relatable feelings
<GOOD> Crying
<GOOD> If this is all a big satire of a satire it would be hilarious but alas
<GOOD> I tried to shave and made it worse
<GOOD> I heavily regret this
<GOOD> I just shaved my legs because I was annoyed the cream didn't work well
<GOOD> It came off shittily
<GOOD> Hopefully it just grows back fast and I can pretend it never happened despite me liking it
<GOOD> We getting more dysphoria with this one!!!!
<GOOD> Oh right I see my parents again in like 2 months hopefully the hair is back by then
<GOOD> Also this cream is dogshit I'm mad
<GOOD> ~~I fw dying alone~~ marriage is ok
<GOOD> In some cases not all
<GOOD> Oh that sounds a lot better
<GOOD> I think this is the 2nd most I've bled in my whole life and it's just from a few razor cuts lmao
<GOOD> I really am more of a bruiser than a bleeder
<GOOD> Yeah I'm a bit more careful around sharp things ig
<GOOD> Still a dumbass which is why I have a plaster on my foot
<GOOD> I'm too jealous for poly
<GOOD> Oh damn that looks like hard work
<GOOD> What are you decorating?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oooo
<GOOD> My dorm is very Boeing
<GOOD> *boring
<GOOD> That's such a cool idea
<GOOD> I FINALLY FOUND A VIDEO I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR MONTHS
<GOOD> YIPPEE
<GOOD> Thank you random twitter shitposting
<GOOD> Finally it is mine
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Told my mom I shaved my legs and she didn't care let's fuckin go
<GOOD> Step in the right direction
<GOOD> It was this post but I just saw this video ages ago too
<GOOD> My mom is the better of my parents about this thing and I asked her specifically not to tell my dad
<GOOD> I'm never coming out to my parents ngl
<GOOD> I wish I could but my dad has made it literally impossible
<GOOD> I think given like 5 years I could tell my mom but my dad? Nah
<GOOD> My dad has said he would never let me show him my boyfriend if I was gay
<GOOD> My mom would prob be ok with it but like, I'm not so
<GOOD> He would absolutely throw me out
<GOOD> I'm actually still at uni during my break instead of home specifically because he said if I told him I supported Palestine I'm never coming home and then gave me a 10 minute lecture on how uninformed I am on it
<GOOD> I didn't tell him but it pissed me off so much
<GOOD> Would rather remain distant with that man
<GOOD> Teaching aid?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I'm in Wales but haven't rlly learnt Welsh
<GOOD> It's never rlly came up because my uni is very accessible to both
<GOOD> I won't say anything to avoid a doxx lmao
<GOOD> Though with that reaction and the fact I'm at uni you could probably do that anyway (please don't)
<GOOD> I kinda do if it's down to the city I live in
<GOOD> Or the specific place I attend
<GOOD> I tell only very close friends that information
<GOOD> Spoon has threatened to hunt me for sport in Chester Zoo before
<GOOD> Before being literally last week when I went
<GOOD> I went alone so the bat cave made me anxious
<GOOD> Fair enough on states but 1 state is the size of the UK
<GOOD> So by saying I'm in Wales that's already narrowing the search a lot
<GOOD> I find a lot of peace in the fact I'm unimportant enough to not be doxxed tho
<GOOD> Also I did not expect my mom to recommend waxing my legs if I want to in future
<GOOD> I'm gonna cry if I do that
<GOOD> At least from what I've heard
<GOOD> I do not know state sizes
<GOOD> I might go on a trip somewhere next week
<GOOD> But Wales has nothing but fucking castles to go see
<GOOD> I'm afraid of tattoos and waxing because of how my parents describe it
<GOOD> I would take any North Wales recommendations
<GOOD> Oh right someone else recommended that
<GOOD> I'm thinking Conwy to vibe at some point
<GOOD> Oh that's not far away
<GOOD> Oh shit you can go down and just watch seals?
<GOOD> Imma have to go in the summer
<GOOD> I'm also considering going on a Puffin boat thingy
<GOOD> Because that sounds fun enough
<GOOD> But yk expensive
<GOOD> Just unfortunate I'm doing all this alone
<GOOD> My mom recommended I get put on a harness and then sent along a wire in a quarry
<GOOD> But I forgot the word for that
<GOOD> Is it still ziplining
<GOOD> I think Angel Bay may be on the list now I love the ocean
<GOOD> Despite already living near the ocean
<GOOD> Mmm, maybe not that
<GOOD> The others seem great tho
<GOOD> I actually went to Llandudno pier a while back, fun novelty
<GOOD> It's very frozen in time
<GOOD> I wanna take the cable cars there but idk where it goes
<GOOD> The cable car goers yearn for the mines
<GOOD> Oh it takes you to Great Orme
<GOOD> The summit of it
<GOOD> So ye the mines
<GOOD> My mom also told me to go to Ireland for a few days if I was curious about it but that sounds expensive
<GOOD> Finally someone to blame for Birmingham
<GOOD> Idk much about the history of UK Politics or even current UK politics tbh
<GOOD> It's never been something I've ever been told about
<GOOD> Closest it got is my dad shittalking David Cameron I think and then bitching about immigration every 10 seconds
<GOOD> Yeah probably, politicians tend to be
<GOOD> I don't rlly know where my dad leans politically bc I don't know the parties or anything much
<GOOD> I can take a pretty safe guess if I can guess which party is the most bigoted, although I imagine it's not great on either side
<GOOD> Because the UK is kinda dogshit
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> Going to Antarctica so I can publicly come out as trans!!!
<GOOD> I have never heard of that
<GOOD> I really should vote that since tbh my vote means nothing if I don't understand shit and both parties are shit
<GOOD> If I read up on it it would probably just upset me even more
<GOOD> For a joke this party is oddly well known
<GOOD> And gets a fair amount of votes I think
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Oh damn it is
<GOOD> Also new OP ep, I get to look at a bunch of nicely animated clips instead of the episode itself
<GOOD> I got called love at the Morrisons checkout
<GOOD> I wasn't even trying to pass man wth
<GOOD> Yeah but this was like a late 20s dude
<GOOD> Hell yeah
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> Nothing drives a person insane like acknowledging Adventure Nightmare Bonnie is in their top 50 characters of all time
<GOOD> Worst case scenario
<GOOD> Eyeless dog incoming
<GOOD> Psychological warfare
<GOOD> I LOVE FRUTIGER AERO RAAAA
<GOOD> I actually wanted to make an OC based on the Wii/DS era type digital frutiger aero aesthetic
<GOOD> HELL YEAH SUPER NOISE OUTFIT
<GOOD> HE ATE THE CHAOS EMERALDS
<GOOD> Bro why does he look so wrong
<GOOD> Is it the head
<GOOD> My biggest problem rn is the head spines
<GOOD> But I will make the body smaller
<GOOD> Partially fixed although not as cartoonishly big
<GOOD> I'm gonna lose it why are his spikes so hard to draw
<GOOD> STOP LOOKING LIKE BOOTLEG ESPIO
<GOOD> It is wrong
<GOOD> Not the issue I'm having currently but yes
<GOOD> I'm planning to just scale it to fit later
<GOOD> His spikes are atrocious I'm crying why are they so hard to draw
<GOOD> Gonna scream
<GOOD> FINALLY
<GOOD> This sounds strange but what games do I play to learn more about Shadow
<GOOD> Apparently all it took was 1 cool looking shadow render for me to be like
<GOOD> Like oh my lord
<GOOD> You're telling me Shadow isn't edgy 24/7 and has other personality traits?
<GOOD> This is preposterous Where's my angry guy
<GOOD> I'm glad to hear that tho
<GOOD> But the other thing
<GOOD> I want metal Sonic :<<<
<GOOD> I need him
<GOOD> Fun fact the reason I haven't talked about metal sonic in 10+ years is because I pissed off my dad so much talking about Metal Sonic and how much I liked him that he yelled at me and told me to stop talking about him so I repressed it
<GOOD> That's how badass Metal Sonic is
<GOOD> Isn't the actual game Sonic 4 like really ugly
<GOOD> At least based on every image I've seen of it
<GOOD> Oh my fucking god that is ugly
<GOOD> Ok that looks ok
<GOOD> It looks like when you make a SMB level in the NSMBU style in Mario Maker
<GOOD> What is the game that prevents sonic 3 being sonic 3
<GOOD> Spinball?
<GOOD> Like if there's an argument for Sonic 3 being Sonic 4, what is Sonic 3
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I thought CD was after 3 oops
<GOOD> Also I'm curious but is there ever a game where Shadow is in sprite form
<GOOD> All cops....
<GOOD> I'm sorry Sonic
<GOOD> He's so cute
<GOOD> Why is his noggin so big I love him
<GOOD> What the hell is Triple Trouble
<GOOD> Hoooly shit
<GOOD> Kinda sad that my most memories with Sonic as a kid were Colours and then the sequel to the PSP game also on the PSP
<GOOD> I always forget the name
<GOOD> Oh and the Sonic Rush game where you're on a boat
<GOOD> And you get boats
<GOOD> Oh let me check if I remember this
<GOOD> HOLY SHIT I DO
<GOOD> YES
<GOOD> I also used the uhhh
<GOOD> Yellow and black Metal Sonic skin I think
<GOOD> Or were they a different non playable character
<GOOD> Bro I need a PSP
<GOOD> Is the render cropped really badly or is that just me
<GOOD> That's hilarious
<GOOD> They used the magic wand
<GOOD> Can you hack a Vita btw?
<GOOD> Oh shit free game time
<GOOD> F-f-found media???
<GOOD> Also just curious but does Vita have any fan project emulators or is its library restricted to whatever PSP/Vita games you want
<GOOD> Could use it to play Metal Gear Acid.....
<GOOD> Did they really have the PSP before this and then not think of this in the slightest
<GOOD> That's so funny
<GOOD> Ah ok
<GOOD> That's good
<GOOD> OOOO
<GOOD> Oh damn, I assume there are setup guides right
<GOOD> I might get a vita instead of a new 3DS
<GOOD> And just keep my old kinda broken 3DS
<GOOD> Damn...
<GOOD> Do hacked vitas do any other useful/novelty things, I don't need to be sold any more on it but I'm curious
<GOOD> I never had a Vita, only PSP
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oops
<GOOD> Gotta clean up before I project my vita room
<GOOD> I don't understand
<GOOD> Spike chunsoft did NOT make Terraria
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Also wait I think people have made fan ports of MGS2 and 3
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> I dig the stripes and jacket
<GOOD> Still can't get over how 1 good render completely changed my interest in Shadow
<GOOD> I used to like Shadow as a kid but I guess I grew out of it?
<GOOD> Or thought I did
<GOOD> Apparently I liked Sonic all along and can never escape
<GOOD> That's awesome
<GOOD> Something's missing
<GOOD> Is this Unleashed
<GOOD> I never beat Unleashed since as a kid I could only beat the first level on wii
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't have a PS3 oops
<GOOD> How does that work
<GOOD> Isn't it a local thing
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That's odd
<GOOD> This is the hardest fucking special edition I've ever seen
<GOOD> Looking at random articles and the brainrot is getting to me
<GOOD> HE'S FAAAAAAAAAT
<GOOD> Apparently N64 and Dreamcast don't run well but idm that
<GOOD> Oh god I hope the stretching isn't forced for every emulated game
<GOOD> Wide Snake
<GOOD> Damn this shit runs the Atari 2600???
<GOOD> Pretty intensive...
<GOOD> Wait
<GOOD> The PS4 supports remote play for Vita too?
<GOOD> Wonder what I can play on it
<GOOD> I mean I do like those things
<GOOD> I wonder what the PSP/Vita/1 library is like
<GOOD> I know PS1 is rlly good
<GOOD> But PSP games I just can't name except Little Big Planet
<GOOD> And Metal Gear Acid
<GOOD> Jill sandwich...
<GOOD> I'll think about all my options
<GOOD> Worst case I just emulate Rush 2 on PC
<GOOD> (Chaotic Evil
<GOOD> I was a kid so I just liked the characters
<GOOD> So like what do we think about this render
<GOOD> Personally this is the fucking worst and even as a kid I was mad about this render, assuming it's the one I'm thinking of
<GOOD> I *think* this is that one super overused modern Sonic render
<GOOD> Because I remember seething as a kid because I didn't like Modern Sonic as much as classic Sonic, a sentiment that remains today but a bit less
<GOOD> But all of the shit I saw about Sonic had a render exactly like that
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I didn't like how he looked
<GOOD> I just thought Classic Sonic was cooler
<GOOD> Idk I think I liked Black Knight and Colours(?(
<GOOD> But Modern Sonic in Generations made me mad because that was the first time I was exposed to Modern Classic Sonic
<GOOD> And the concept of different character designs
<GOOD> Because before then my stupid baby brain was just like it's all Sonic
<GOOD> And it required turning Sonic into 2 entirely different entities to get the difference across to me
<GOOD> The classic sonic in Generations
<GOOD> Because Classic Sonic is like, Sonic 1 Sonic, and Modern Classic Sonic is Gens Sonic
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> That's why I said Modern Classic
<GOOD> Because Classic Classic is not the same
<GOOD> He's like the CD cutscene guy right
<GOOD> SA1 and 2?
<GOOD> Or do they count as classic
<GOOD> Why is his leg like that
<GOOD> Does he have knees
<GOOD> Why is he winking with his pupil
<GOOD> I'm scared
<GOOD> Did he always do that
<GOOD> Yeah but like, he *has* eyelids
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure he has 2 eyelids
<GOOD> Is (modern) sonic different to modern sonic
<GOOD> Or are you just saying sonic (modern)
<GOOD> Who is (Modern) Sonic
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is (Modern) finalised movie Sonic
<GOOD> Are you being intentionally confusing this cannot be how the sonic fanbase categorises designs
<GOOD> But yeah as a kid Classic Sonic was the first time I understood differences in character design
<GOOD> Because beforehand a character was just a character
<GOOD> Underground Sonic was also that dude in Black Knight and Rush DS and the DS RPG and generations and later Boom which I didn't play
<GOOD> But then when I saw Classic Sonic I was like ohhhhhh
<GOOD> And then when I saw Boom Sonic I was like ohhhhh but sad
<GOOD> It's fine but ngl I believed you
<GOOD> I wouldn't put it past the Sonic fandom to actually call them that
<GOOD> Does the Sonic fandom have a version of these renders
<GOOD> I gotta ask
<GOOD> Oh I was right then
<GOOD> Yeah that is probably the render that pissed me off as a kid then
<GOOD> That was the one present in Generations and most promo material right
<GOOD> I still don't understand this one like is he trying to give me a hug but his legs got in the way
<GOOD> Of all the classic sonic games the one I was exposed most to as a kid was my dad tilting at Robotnik's mean bean machine
<GOOD> I still find it so funny how I'm only now rediscovering my love for some Sonic characters because my dad so aggressively used to tell me to shut the fuck up about said Sonic characters
<GOOD> So now like 10+ years later I'm remembering I had to repress Metal Sonic and Shadow being cool as fuck
<GOOD> Because I'd talk about Metal Sonic while the TV was on or smth
<GOOD> THAT'S THE ONE
<GOOD> THAT'S THE RENDER
<GOOD> Oh my god that's it
<GOOD> I thought it was the other one
<GOOD> How tf do you piss off a child sonic fan with such a criminal render
<GOOD> I didn't even understand what a render was at that point, they were appealing to primal feelings of disgust
<GOOD> Top 10 hottest female Sonic characters
<GOOD> That is fucking atrocious
<GOOD> Expect what
<GOOD> The absolute gall to call this game Sonic 4
<GOOD> Sonic games are so good until I have to play them
<GOOD> Jk currently 3&K is awesome I have hyper sonic
<GOOD> (I cheated by being able to replay blue spheres)
<GOOD> What is the lore reason for blue spheres
<GOOD> Why does he run through the spheres
<GOOD> Why must he collect hundreds of rings and yell at Tails for fucking up and dropping my fucking rings I hate you Tails
<GOOD> Ok they suck but who that on the right
<GOOD> Might need to remake my top 10......
<GOOD> Sorry Vanilla the rabbit
<GOOD> I loved Omega as a kid too but never forgot about that one
<GOOD> Who is the star dude
<GOOD> I swear I've seen him mentioned once before in a Sonic Prime discussion
<GOOD> It was when that so retro clip was circulating
<GOOD> I think they accidentally put him in or smth
<GOOD> Oh lmao
<GOOD> Is sonic battle like xcom
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Just like Juml Force....
<GOOD> Also this just reminded me my favourite ever Mario character and character image is from Mario Strikers
<GOOD> You won't believe this
<GOOD> It has the fucking animation style
<GOOD> Where they squash and stretch the render
<GOOD> I can't say what I normally call it here
<GOOD> God what is that style called
<GOOD> It's also that one NSMBWii rended video
<GOOD> If it was this leaker gotta be locked up
<GOOD> Someone just sent me this
<GOOD> Please tell me this is fake
<GOOD> Why is his mouth like that
<GOOD> Also have been made aware of the hard af wreck it ralph sonic
<GOOD> Hooooly shit
<GOOD> If Mario
<GOOD> 1 more Kirby down
<GOOD> I should rlly make a spreadsheet of games/series I wanna and have completed at some point
<GOOD> Unless there's a website for that
<GOOD> Which there rlly should be
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Must start cataloguing all my beaten games
<GOOD> Also Dark Matter was neat
<GOOD> I finally finished all my project work
<GOOD> Just gotta read over it all now
<GOOD> I wanna draw
<GOOD> I feel strange
<GOOD> Probably?
<GOOD> I have drank ye
<GOOD> I think I've been eating too much ngl
<GOOD> I should diet
<GOOD> My stupid stomach sticks out a bit and I hate it
<GOOD> And I realise what I'm eating is crap
<GOOD> It is when I look at it and get upset
<GOOD> >open SA1
>no idea where to go because I quit midway through the story like an hour in
<GOOD> Ty past me
<GOOD> I found a snowboard level...
<GOOD> It's so cool
<GOOD> I still haven't watched because I'm blind playing SA1
<GOOD> I've watched a lot longer a lot more often
<GOOD> Also I'm addicted to this video and its parodies it's so funny
<GOOD> Idk who tf this is but they're so silly
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> I'm currently in my Dunmeshi era
<GOOD> I've only got Frye, Senshi and the original here
<GOOD> I am OC brainstorming
<GOOD> I could never draw what I want tho
<GOOD> I wanna make a sona but I never get far
<GOOD> Understanding how it would represent me
<GOOD> I get stuck at the ideas phase because they usually don't feel right
<GOOD> Yeah I've been on it forever
<GOOD> The OC (not sona) I'm thinking of rn is a Kars/tyranid style human weapon
<GOOD> Kars is the ultimate life form in Jojo's bizarre adventure
<GOOD> He can adapt his body to gain any quality of any creature and just straight up create life
<GOOD> Tyranids are the same, they're extremophile cosmic monsters that adapt to their surroundings perfectly for war
<GOOD> They can just like grow pincers and shit
<GOOD> So the character I'm making is in a DnD style setting so he'd be able to say, turn his arm into acidic slime, suffocate someone with it, and then turn the slime into a venus flytrap type creature and dissolve them
<GOOD> Or shoot a parasitic seed into someone that grows into a bunch of giant worms or snakes instead of roots after burrowing inside them
<GOOD> Body horror type shit
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I originally was creating a plant mage character for the same reason
<GOOD> I love jojo style pseudoscience explanations for powers but blown up to a fantastical degree
<GOOD> Indeed they're like my favourite faction
<GOOD> Had an idea for a fight where they finally fight a fire mage and end up beating them using a pitcher plant filled with completely soaked tree bark
<GOOD> Whole body
<GOOD> Feng shui....
<GOOD> Also that random shit when Araki was talking about the skyfish
<GOOD> It's so funny that he just did that lmao
<GOOD> Wait they aren't called skyfish tf are they called
<GOOD> The Apollo 11 dude's power
<GOOD> Oh right
<GOOD> I do like their power but I feel like Araki just tacked on ooooo they eat body heat as cool as it is
<GOOD> I'm aware of the myth it was because of light on the lens iirc
<GOOD> But the organ failure shit was cool af
<GOOD> Rods that make me piss myself....
<GOOD> Yeah they use the power of the sun to flash images of snails at them
<GOOD> Except they literally turn into snails lmao
<GOOD> It's only accidental because he has 2 personalities
<GOOD> Yeah that's how jojo is in general
<GOOD> Like Jolyne almost getting killed by a pair of keys on a glider
<GOOD> If my literal manifestation of my soul was a piece of fucking paper and some keys I'd just end it right there
<GOOD> Stand sickness take me
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Manhattan Transfer is a stand that is literally just a glider and some keys
<GOOD> There's also killing the meteor dude with a shoe
<GOOD> And like, part 8 gas football
<GOOD> And Vincent Van Gogh
<GOOD> These are all jojo
<GOOD> The later in the parts you get the more convoluted they get
<GOOD> Like in part 3 they're fairly tame like it's a really fast bug or it lives in reflections
<GOOD> And by part 5 you're like if you're vertically below me geographically you start getting moldy and I also live in reflections but in a more convoluted different way
<GOOD> I mean hanged man is just a dude in a reflection that travels between them as light
<GOOD> From what I remember of man in the mirror it's like a whole different world
<GOOD> And they try to use Moody Blues and it doesn't work
<GOOD> Oh and there's the deflating 2 boat guy
<GOOD> Or that dude that just kills himself on an airport runway, somehow knowing that his stand would do what it does
<GOOD> I think the weirdest fight in part 5 was the shark and talking head
<GOOD> Then part 6 there are no simple stands
<GOOD> Like literally none come to mind
<GOOD> Except like Goo Goo Dolls
<GOOD> Yeah the dream shit and the acid lmao
<GOOD> MiH also kind of is simple
<GOOD> White Snake strapped scene
<GOOD> Why didn't Pucci just calm down and count prime numbers here? Is he stupid?
<GOOD> I love how characters in jojo just have random *things* that are entirely irrelevant
<GOOD> Like Pucci with the cherries
<GOOD> Unfortunately for every peak stand you get a Baby Face and a Dragon's Dream
<GOOD> And a Set, and a Geb, and-
<GOOD> Actually I'll hop off Geb
<GOOD> The Sun is ass tho
<GOOD> I don't dislike Dragon's Dream
<GOOD> But it's so weird
<GOOD> Set is still like the 1 episode of Jojo I always skip
<GOOD> Actually maybe Strength too
<GOOD> I forgot the name of his stand
<GOOD> Yeah but strength isn't a tarot card I don't think
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh right I also sometimes skip Angelo
<GOOD> Just because I don't need to watch it more than once and Angelo himself is gross
<GOOD> Angelo didn't need to be who he was, like that exposition dump was just nasty
<GOOD> At least it has Josuke swallowing a glove and the humidifier
<GOOD> I was literally about to type that
<GOOD> Kills you
<GOOD> I like how people do media analysis on that text box like it wasn't exclusively Araki fucking around
<GOOD> That and ||Pocoloco winning|| were the funniest things
<GOOD> The amount of screentime dedicated to Pocoloco compared to how important he is is hilarious
<GOOD> Like I don't remember a single time where him being there actually changes a thing
<GOOD> However this is still the funniest thing hands down, the little face picture completes it
<GOOD> He should have just spun the disease out of him by making a horse kick him or smth
<GOOD> As always
<GOOD> >my friend asks me to go to their flat today help them with some work they gotta get done
>hasn't actually talked about it all day
>currently in a VC with her bf watching guilty gear with a deadline for 2 projects in 12 days
<GOOD> Nah man I'm hitting with the BRC Bedman wall combo
<GOOD> I labbed it for hours I may as well
<GOOD> How it feels to land literally fucking anything as Bedman
<GOOD> I didn't know DS users were that hostile
<GOOD> I guess I stayed out of the CoD DS port voice chats
<GOOD> Frye what did you mean by this
<GOOD> Splat 3 wishes it had
<GOOD> Callie is like the jellyfish are so happi :DD and Marie is
<GOOD> Yeah but she's more unintentionally hurtful which is funny
<GOOD> And then Splat 2 is just women kissing
<GOOD> Big Betrayal was awesome tho
<GOOD> Deep Cut's peak was beefing with a lesbian couple
<GOOD> Well Deep Cut minus Big Man
<GOOD> Honorary lesbian
<GOOD> Me after I get income and an amiibo restock
<GOOD> Are we talking about MC
<GOOD> Or SSBI
<GOOD> SSBU
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I need to find some less intensive MC mods to try ngl
<GOOD> My main counters Steve because I'm built different
<GOOD> Steve when I shoot a Nikita missile over his stupid fucking wall
<GOOD> I remember spamming missile against my friend and letting him get some hits in by not cancelling it when it missed, and then randomly mid match I started cancelling it and punishing him
<GOOD> Also his dash attack being a free and fairly inconspicuous opportunity to plant C4 is funny
<GOOD> Me when like 3 polygons
<GOOD> (I still need to play OSRS)
<GOOD> Being around steve
<GOOD> I need to play the Warden update in MC
<GOOD> My friend bought me OSRS membership so she could carry me through a fast boost dungeon and then buy me shit
<GOOD> So now I'm kinda on my own in OSRS with no knowledge
<GOOD> The low poly armour goes pretty crazy
<GOOD> There was like some good quest that you could rush if you knew what you were doing
<GOOD> Like we sprinted through an area where we could get one shot
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I was about to say it was that
<GOOD> But yeah then she bought me good ass armour and a weapon and I think a starter cape
<GOOD> But now I'm just lost
<GOOD> Because I haven't played in ages
<GOOD> I could do that passively for hours with something else in a window ngk
<GOOD> She also showed me some assault course I forgot how to get back to
<GOOD> Where it levels some stat a large amount if you complete it
<GOOD> Found it
<GOOD> She told me how but I forgot
<GOOD> I doubt I'd ever do PvP ngl
<GOOD> Just strollin around
<GOOD> It's ok I'm not playing rn
<GOOD> I think I logged off last time at the grand exchange
<GOOD> And I was very intimidated being there alone
<GOOD> Because last time I was basically told to sit still and not talk to strangers like a child
<GOOD> I am too trusting in general so
<GOOD> I think she bought me mithril armour, some necklace and a scimitar(?(
<GOOD> I don't remember fully
<GOOD> And a cape
<GOOD> I like how it looks
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I think Smite got a skin based on it
<GOOD> I wish I'd gotten one of the OSRS skins
<GOOD> Specifically the gnome
<GOOD> Or the wizard or the armour
<GOOD> But I don't like the character that the armour was for
<GOOD> I haven't played in a while
<GOOD> It probably hasn't changed much
<GOOD> Oh right
<GOOD> I have a t5 in Smite 1
<GOOD> Why is it back
<GOOD> I thought I had escaped my YTP era
<GOOD> Dinner will now be a trigger word for me once again
<GOOD> It's a trend again
<GOOD> Of videos like this
<GOOD> Is it bad to say I like CDi Link's design
<GOOD> Or at least his hair
<GOOD> Like he's one of my favourite Links unironically
<GOOD> Pushmo
<GOOD> Crashmo is also good
<GOOD> At least I've heard
<GOOD> They're puzzle games
<GOOD> Boxboy is short and sweet too
<GOOD> But all of these are eshop so you need CFW
<GOOD> Kid Icarus Uprising is one I still need to play when I replace my 3DS
<GOOD> I wanna buy a New 3DS XL when my birthday arrives
<GOOD> I keep forgetting the difference between new 3DS XL and new 2DS XL
<GOOD> Dinner of Pingastale
<GOOD> I should watch Bullet Train
<GOOD> I never ended up watching it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> YIPPRE
<GOOD> YIPPEE
<GOOD> MAJOR UPDAYE
<GOOD> A lot of those people are not very friendly lmao
<GOOD> Plus making you a war criminal by default when you don't have to be is
<GOOD> Youtube content farm for thePS2
<GOOD> The baby...
<GOOD> It gets to everyone eventually
<GOOD> Just slower
<GOOD> These random slop investigation channels are my weakness tbh
<GOOD> Guilty pleasure
<GOOD> Damn frozen chicken breasts are cheap
<GOOD> I gotta buy them more
<GOOD> Might be time
<GOOD> I'm trans tho I gotta play NV
<GOOD> Watching the Mario 64 hitbox movie
<GOOD> A video hasn't interested me like this in awhilw
<GOOD> Cieling triangle: SQUEE cancelling vertical momentum is SO cute and I HATE that annoying popular floor triangle!
Out of bounds: Ok Mario now hit me randomly in normal gameplay 50% of the time
<GOOD> Hell yeah
<GOOD> My friend told me I confuse her and she forgets I'm a dude sometimes
<GOOD> I'm very happy
<GOOD> Well in a nicer way than that she just said she forgot that biologically I'd grow hair faster because I pull off gender neutral so well
<GOOD> I mean she didn't say I was a guy
<GOOD> I phrased it poorly but she just said she forgot biologically I'd grow hair fast bc I apparently pass well as gender neutral and she forgets
<GOOD> It was probably just flattery tbh
<GOOD> I confused an employee the other day
<GOOD> Early 30s dude called me love
<GOOD> I call my friend dude
<GOOD> She calls me dude too
<GOOD> I'm usually demiboy so I don't rlly mind dude
<GOOD> I use it for everyone
<GOOD> Brain injury???
<GOOD> The sauce was not spicy but very yummy
<GOOD> Will use on many things
<GOOD> I mean I felt it but that doesn't make it hot
<GOOD> Vusa?
<GOOD> Also ngl I have really low spice tolerance
<GOOD> The worst this did was make it feel hotter than it was because I hadn't had spice in a while initially
<GOOD> Then I drank juice after eating a whole meal doused in it
<GOOD> Yummy sauce tho
<GOOD> Nah I feel like a sauce called Assmelter or some stupid shit just wouldn't be fun
<GOOD> I don't mind Nando's hot because spice is meant to be tasty and not just kill you
<GOOD> Is it just pure capsin
<GOOD> I don't think I've tried extra hot
<GOOD> But that would probably be my limit
<GOOD> I'd prob need to start bringing milk or taking a lil break on Vusa
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ngl I'm happy this is natural tolerance lmao I love spicy food but haven't like, gained tolerance over time
<GOOD> Fellas my hair is getting so long
<GOOD> I have for months
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Best compliment ever
<GOOD> Also most low hanging joke possible
<GOOD> I also bought Your only move is Hustke
<GOOD> *Hustle
<GOOD> I hate this
<GOOD> I'm becoming so vain
<GOOD> And it's making me more self conscious
<GOOD> 1 thing in particular too and I hate it I hate it I hate it
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> My body woke me up at half 6
<GOOD> Just looked at skincare products for the first time in a shop
<GOOD> Too overwhelming tbh just bought some wipes and something that I think is moisturiser
<GOOD> And cotton disks
<GOOD> They're aloe cleansing wipes
<GOOD> The lotion is something anti acne I think?
<GOOD> Salicylic acid
<GOOD> And then whatever this is idk how to use it
<GOOD> I have itchi face after shaves x_x
<GOOD> I have no idea about makeup ngl
<GOOD> Haven't even started
<GOOD> I think skincare is probably first
<GOOD> This isn't rlly anti aging it's just hydrating afaik
<GOOD> And I do have kinda rough skin so I may as well try the ones I bought frfr
<GOOD> Just not in excess
<GOOD> I think that's basically what I got with that green solution
<GOOD> Idk I just scrubbed my face really really hard with exfoliating cream and it worked
<GOOD> To think this is the franchise I'm the biggest fan of out of all franchises
<GOOD> Who in the absolute fuck is he
<GOOD> THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET IT RIGHT
<GOOD> THE PREQUEL GAME IS FNAF 4 RAAAAA
<GOOD> (I forgot where 2 even fits is 2 still Jrs)
<GOOD> Fairly sure 2 is actually a 1 sequel
<GOOD> I don't think that's the case anymore
<GOOD> But idfk anymore because the theorists are more out of control than ever
<GOOD> I saw a theory earlier suggesting the Classic animatronics were mimic endos
<GOOD> And that Phone Guy is Purple Guy again
<GOOD> And that 2nd one was said by the Game Theory channel
<GOOD> I'm never going back to phone guy is purple guy bruh that era was hell
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> I wish I didn't care about this again
<GOOD> But I do so much ngl
<GOOD> Oh my god who the fuck is this thing and why do I keep seeing it everywhere
<GOOD> Why does he reflect physical
<GOOD> What does that mean
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<GOOD> Ngl planets would be sick ass inspirations for enby names....
<GOOD> That isn't me
<GOOD> Usually without the covered eye
<GOOD> Dam
<GOOD> Creatura
<GOOD> Evergreen
<GOOD> Hallo
<GOOD> I have kept drawing despite better judgement
<GOOD> Oh dear
<GOOD> I'm kinda upset but it's the regular kind of upset so we ball
<GOOD> Mmm I getcha kinda, I have a repetitive strain thing with my leg and achilles I think
<GOOD> Mfhfjnfnfn must draw more
<GOOD> Not cool enough
<GOOD> I wanna make a pfp but it's always so annoying
<GOOD> Because I can't think of anything that fits my sona into that circle and idk what expression pose clothes etcetc
<GOOD> Plus it needs to look better than my usual art
<GOOD> Yooooo
<GOOD> I'm still only out to like 2 people for safety
<GOOD> My parents are never finding out
<GOOD> Teehee
<GOOD> Oh no I can't because I'd probably {redacted} if I was told by my parents I can't come home
<GOOD> It would break my heart as much as my dad frustrates me
<GOOD> Plus he's threatened to not let me come home for less lmao
<GOOD> Literally did it 3 weeks ago-
<GOOD> Yooo
<GOOD> That's gud
<GOOD> Same haha
<GOOD> I'm obsessed
<GOOD> I made them look a little  tho
<GOOD> Yoooo mine does too
<GOOD> I honestly like the rough lineart a bit more
<GOOD> It made them look crazier
<GOOD> That's a toucan actually
<GOOD> Done (only in MK8D tho)
<GOOD> Why the fuck does my uni Internet shit itself at midnight
<GOOD> Gay stairs
<GOOD> Freaky Video Game Nerd
<GOOD> I was so confused about 5 seconds into reading this
<GOOD> And got more confused when you started talking about stars
<GOOD> Father Pucci waiting in line at that NASA launch site
<GOOD> But jojo's childhood wasn't normal
<GOOD> It was bizarre......
<GOOD> Not only that, it's 4/20/24
<GOOD> Palindrome 420
<GOOD> It is dwdw
<GOOD> She looks like WHO
<GOOD> Speaking of snoop dogg apparently the roadmap for the entire next fortnite year was leaked
<GOOD> She's a shitty person apparently
<GOOD> Also I don't listen to Taylor Swift can someone tell me if this is real
<GOOD> I get how it's a jab at nostalgia but why did she specify without the racists
<GOOD> Is she suggesting that no racists is a bad thing
<GOOD> The 1830s was everything-ist
<GOOD> Also genuinely what else does the 1830s have that would make you want to go there
<GOOD> Also as I said if this song is about how the 1830s and nostalgia is bad then like why would you specify non-racist 1830s is the bad one
<GOOD> I've never listened to Taylor Swift before are her lyrics always like this
<GOOD> The game becoming unfun when racism is removed
<GOOD> I just don't understand what's like, the point of specifying that
<GOOD> Yeah I'm good with being sold but the racism is a bridge too far bucko
<GOOD> I mean the lyric doesn't make sense
<GOOD> I don't understand why you'd specify that like
<GOOD> Wish I lived in the 1830s but without the racism, sexism and risk of dying of a cold and/or sepsis when I hurt myself
<GOOD> I mean I genuinely don't understand the point of the lyric
<GOOD> If I lived in the 1830s if it wasn't racist it would still be shit?
<GOOD> I don't understand why would you say that
<GOOD> That bar could be conveyed by just saying the later part
<GOOD> Is there something I'm missing with the racism part
<GOOD> It seems like a very specific thing to say
<GOOD> I would be focusing on the trees if one of them was bright orange
<GOOD> I mean I guess?
<GOOD> It very poorly conveys what it's saying tho
<GOOD> Like is she stupid?
<GOOD> ~~I wouldn't fit in either if I said something that stupid~~
<GOOD> If I could live in any decade I'd live in prehistoric times but without the risk of dinosaurs, and then get a stone pick through my skull
<GOOD> My bar clears because it has a dinosaur
<GOOD> Idk just feels like a songwriter would be better at writing songs
<GOOD> (I know she absolutely doesn't write her own atp)
<GOOD> They should hire me tbh
<GOOD> If only she spat like this  (I don't listen to this dude either)
<GOOD> I kinda relate to the lyric because I'll randomly say unhinged shit in response to a very mild question but like
<GOOD> It was a bad line
<GOOD> I guess?
<GOOD> But like that's such an odd answer to give even if you're talking about the reality of it
<GOOD> I mean fair enough
<GOOD> Nobody reminisces about a time they didn't exist tho
<GOOD> I don't have nostalgia for 2000BC where I'd be bludgeoned to death by some bloke for no reason
<GOOD> Probably because they didn't go at all since lockdowns lol
<GOOD> Maybe it's just not literal enough for my stupid ass to get
<GOOD> Taylor swift being like if I lived in the 1830s but without racism I'd be sold to someone
<GOOD> Idk I just don't understand nuance usually I take text literally
<GOOD> Maybe music just isn't my thing
<GOOD> At least lyrics
<GOOD> That wasn't fun to not understand at all
<GOOD> I hate not understanding shit for no reason it's so annoying
<GOOD> Idk I'm autistic and it just makes me question lyrics like this
<GOOD> Or get annoyed at clearly nonsensical or stupid lyrics
<GOOD> I usually get moved by music rather than lyrics
<GOOD> These lyrics frustrate me
<GOOD> Tf you mean villain: the worst guy
<GOOD> Who the fuck is that meant to be why are you saying that
<GOOD> What villain
<GOOD> The final line is also very confusing
<GOOD> Why would you specify how you're not gonna teach someone something
<GOOD> Using molasses?
<GOOD> I'm ngl I've never heard slower than cold molasses in my entire life
<GOOD> I've heard slow as molasses like twice
<GOOD> So he's teaching people what they don't know by heating up treacle?
<GOOD> Like he's making it flow I guess but like
<GOOD> What is he teaching and why would you use hot molasses as any sort of descriptor
<GOOD> Yeah because that line makes perfect sense when I'm like ohhhh this saying I don't know about this random fluid is being turned on its head to indicate that hot treacle flows faster, meaning that he teaches people by flowing!!!
<GOOD> Wouldn't flows like hot molasses immediately make the line more clear
<GOOD> Sounds a bit more impactful when it doesn't take fucking forever to understand a line past a meaning because you're reaching for a rhyme
<GOOD> Like a lot of the lines are just in there for the sake of being a line that rhymes in there why would they bounce from talking about shot glasses to being Jesus or whatever
<GOOD> Is there a reason they're square
<GOOD> If we wanna talk about visual imagery I'd talk about him dumping boiling treacle on people
<GOOD> Like when is it not a metaphor for something else and when is it just a line they threw in for no reason
<GOOD> This is why it frustrates me so much of it sounds like absolute nonsense and half of it is actually just thrown in and half of it is some apparent metaphor
<GOOD> Like yeah great you threw a double meaning in but half of the fucking song isn't that
<GOOD> I literally said this is why I dislike most lyrics in songs
<GOOD> Lyrics frustrate me because half the time they're obtuse or just annoying
<GOOD> And when they actually do have some random metaphor I don't fucking understand it because the rest of the song is equally flowery and has shit thrown in
<GOOD> I'm aware but intentionally mixing in metaphor with things that are equally overly detailed to make the song flow better makes it cluttered
<GOOD> Ok ig
<GOOD> Like in text metaphors are easy to understand but most songs smash lines into very clunky things to read
<GOOD> Hell yeah they actually telling a story with this song
<GOOD> (Also I'm generally of the opinion that metaphors kinda suck but oh well)
<GOOD> I get that one
<GOOD> I mean this one mostly makes sense to me
<GOOD> And the parts I don't understand are just things I don't understand in general like a MoMA
<GOOD> I understand the rest
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> What are the Palisades
<GOOD> Is that some sort of issue
<GOOD> Oh ok makes sense
<GOOD> Ye I got that by the 2nd line
<GOOD> Surprisingly
<GOOD> I mean wasn't the other person bragging about their lifestyle and their flow
<GOOD> It just seems like rap in general is pretty boastful
<GOOD> I mean ye I doubt there's nuance in the 2nd one
<GOOD> I just understand it easier
<GOOD> Fair enough
<GOOD> Unfortunately the most annoying song I've ever listened to was kinda shitty british rap on the radio where they just constantly said they were gonna go beast mode and flexed about stuff for a few minutes
<GOOD> I liked this song by the way
<GOOD> I feel like being forced to listen to things I don't understand wouldn't help me appreciate it more
<GOOD> Well yeah because it's frustrating to be talked down to about whatever obvious cue I missed this time
<GOOD> Knowing whether something is a cue or not is not possible for me
<GOOD> I don't think that way
<GOOD> I mean he didn't say it was flowing like hot molasses
<GOOD> If he said that I would understand
<GOOD> Because something flowing like hot molasses would imply it flows fast, like a hot syrupy thingy
<GOOD> Saying you are literally using the flow of molasses or whatever is just
<GOOD> Like just use a simile metaphors aren't as impactful as you think
<GOOD> I mean yeah most music and art in general is something I experience instead of think about
<GOOD> I *can* think about it ig but it's not interesting to me
<GOOD> That works until they also start talking about square shot glasses mid song
<GOOD> Why would they be talking about a square shot glass though they haven't mentioned anything like that before
<GOOD> Yeah square glasses kinda shit to hold but they look neat
<GOOD> Yeah?
<GOOD> It doesn't make sense when you throw it in immediately after unrelated things tho
<GOOD> I hate this :<
<GOOD> That crimson king song was cool tho
<GOOD> Wait was the crimson king song also a metaphor
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> That's what gets me because then when there are random words I'll say that doesn't make sense! And I'll be wrong because it actually has some other meaning
<GOOD> That's why I just feel it at a base level because the lyrics at face value are the easiest to understand
<GOOD> ~~And ngl sometimes listening to the lyrics is hard because by the time they've been said I can't think about or process them~~
<GOOD> I know it's just frustrating when it makes sense to everyone else
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> It happens with most lyrical songs but ye
<GOOD> That's usually how I consume music ye
<GOOD> All of my art is experienced and not thought about p much unless I actually understand it
<GOOD> And that's fine when it's described
<GOOD> Metaphors and stuff get me further away from understanding what they're conveying, being incredibly descriptive is the way to my heart
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Idk if I'll look into it more because it makes me frustrated but I'll keep it in mind
<GOOD> Like forming vivid descriptions in my mind from direct descriptions or comparisons is the easiest way for me to get it
<GOOD> And usually enjoy ut
<GOOD> Idk I'm never itching for a metaphor, maybe an allegory sometimes but only when I have context
<GOOD> It hasn't historically
<GOOD> But video essays are my thing if they directly explain it
<GOOD> Me getting pissy about lyrics actually being art and not being dumbed down for my stupid ass
<GOOD> I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha OMG SAMS
<GOOD> Yeah but yk not understanding anything unless it's directly explained to me is annoying and makes me feel like a dumb child
<GOOD> Also all music is art
<GOOD> I mostly just listen to instrumental stuff
<GOOD> Or stuff like Sploon music where the lyrics don't actually exist and are basically just another part of the song that I physically can't think about
<GOOD> (Also this is tangentially related to me disliking those things where people give lyrics to non lyrical songs)
<GOOD> Oh absolutely
<GOOD> Because like it's pure emotion and vibe
<GOOD> I understand the lyric because it's just the emotion of the singer
<GOOD> It's literally just like another instrument but it lets the emotion of the instrument user to come through
<GOOD> Yeah but as far as I'm concerned if the music achieves the effect of doing that without me thinking about it idm
<GOOD> There's plenty of music theory but music that just stirs emotion to anyone is the best
<GOOD> For me at least
<GOOD> I should actually
<GOOD> Idk anything about K or Jpop
<GOOD> I also like a few Miku songs because her voice is literally an instrument
<GOOD> Fly Octo Fly Ebb and Flow causes me to stim from excitement so must disagree, the hype songs go crazy
<GOOD> Tentacle to the Metal also messes with my brain
<GOOD> The Salmon Run songs are interesting to me to actually think about oddly enough
<GOOD> But nothing beyond I find it interesting how all these discordant instruments that shouldn't make music together make bangers
<GOOD> Like they had no right to have a fucking violin solo in the middle of a song
<GOOD> it's just so silly
<GOOD> I can't help it
<GOOD> (Yes about half the song is just those beats)
<GOOD> Oh also rhythm heaven scratches my brain good
<GOOD> Too good in fact if it's brought up it gets stuck for so so so long
<GOOD> Also that video repeats the song for some reason
<GOOD> Even when it's clearly not meant to
<GOOD> When you hand a splatoon fan the aux and they play the
<GOOD> Salmon Run really bends what's classed as music ngl
<GOOD> I love it
<GOOD> Like it makes bangers that shouldn't exist
<GOOD> Like I'm fairly sure Frothy Waters just has a wind chime in it
<GOOD> I feel like shit for complaining about not getting lyrics in songs because it makes me feel like I want songs to have lyrics like this
<GOOD> And while it would be really fucking funny if every song was like 2 lines repeated over and over I don't think it would stick
<GOOD> Anyway it's half 2am
<GOOD> Naw I love the vocals
<GOOD> They so awesome
<GOOD> Big fan of the latest song uhhh what the name
<GOOD> The Pearl/Marina/Shiver/Frye one
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Big Betrayal is also fun
<GOOD> Probably what Pearl said
<GOOD> She was born a hater I love Pearl
<GOOD> My thirsty ass watching this
<GOOD> NOT THAT KIND
<GOOD> That one fucking clip of the dude making the boo noise always makes me laugh
<GOOD> I need to do something today ngl
<GOOD> I have nothing to do but I wanna do things
<GOOD> I've literally done everything I could do
<GOOD> Morb
<GOOD> Morn
<GOOD> I've done a bunch of chores and cleaned my whole room etc so I'm pretty tired
<GOOD> Plus I usually need to like, be going somewhere to want to go out
<GOOD> Short walks are nice for me ye
<GOOD> It's just wanting to rationalise doing something like that because my brain always has to have an objective
<GOOD> I'm enjoying the sun rn by basking on my bed
<GOOD> I decided since cats enjoying curling up in a ball on the foot of a bed in the sun, it must have some reason
<GOOD> Oml those cats were so right I'm doing this more
<GOOD> I don't rlly talk to strangers much
<GOOD> I've been trying my hardest to pay compliments to random people recently but it's hard
<GOOD> I mostly compliment cool clothes
<GOOD> The closest I've gotten is complimenting my lecturer's doom shirt
<GOOD> Counterpoint
<GOOD> I should buy a really cool hat and then they'll be like cool hat!
<GOOD> I do actually wanna start a patch jacket
<GOOD> I think it would be nice to easily convey things about me
<GOOD> And it would be drippy
<GOOD> Hooooly shit
<GOOD> Also holy shit the new game theory cooked
<GOOD> Actually refreshing fnaf theory
<GOOD> Writing lore for my fake world again
<GOOD> Still no idea what races are gonna be here
<GOOD> Guess I'll keep writing about dungeons
<GOOD> I'm playing Sonic 3 rn and he's a kind of antagonist
<GOOD> He does the same in SA1 very briefly
<GOOD> At least from what I've played
<GOOD> Isn't most of black knight just different characters that look like those characters anyway
<GOOD> Like in cartoons where they tell a story and the characters just look like characters from the show
<GOOD> Probably because of the movie
<GOOD> Even though the same happens there
<GOOD> Have a nice fall you stupid bi
<GOOD> I think someone did
<GOOD> I don't have the post on hand tho
<GOOD> Hoooly shit
<GOOD> Me when baby knuckles
<GOOD> The holy trinity of things that sonic Underground are brought back for are the opening, that gif and this gif
<GOOD> I will protect baby Shadow
<GOOD> The rest will be thrown off a cliff to see if they survive like those birds
<GOOD> I wonder how Maria ends up?
<GOOD> (Overdone joke)
<GOOD> I haven't played games in like a week I wanna play FF7 but I keep thinking about how I was mildly stuck and therefore can never play again
<GOOD> I did hear that I apparently quit KH1 at the filter area before the part where it gets good tho so I'm installing that
<GOOD> I want it but no moneys
<GOOD> Although I also heard that it never gets good so idk what source to believe
<GOOD> Fuckin jungle area though I spent so much time being lost there that area was so ass idc if children can beat it
<GOOD> Sephiroth being dangled like keys unfortunately works for me
<GOOD> Need to play more sonic, or any other game
<GOOD> I followed amy into a theme park or smth
<GOOD> And then got a keycard or smth
<GOOD> Mega man WHO???
<GOOD> Need Goofy drawn in the style of this image
<GOOD> It's a shame the hardest fnaf fanart ever has been ruined for me by quit talking to emma.
<GOOD> Love this image tho
<GOOD> I'm in my fnaf phase again (almost 10 years unbroken streak)
<GOOD> Spoon
<GOOD> Read Kagurabachi
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> Best new gen
<GOOD> The fandom has been hiring fujoshis to grow the fanbase
<GOOD> It's hilarious we love this manga and need it to thrive
<GOOD> Nobody knows my suffering...
<GOOD> Me when insulated homes
<GOOD> Getting baked alive in my home
<GOOD> They didn't say that
<GOOD> They said it was infuriating
<GOOD> Yea I've had my fair share of deserved because you were born in england
<GOOD> Guys the french and british!!! I'm so funy guys look at stereotype!!!
<GOOD> Same with america jokes ngl
<GOOD> They eat like the planes are still overhead is the dryest joke I've ever heard
<GOOD> So I usually just be really boring by saying the US has worse dental or whatever
<GOOD> The jokes in general are reaaaaaally boring like can you come up with a new one
<GOOD> I'm obsessed with this skeleton being inexplicably cute to me
<GOOD> Lmaooooooo
<GOOD> Oh my friend just walked out of the lecture without saying a word to me
<GOOD> That's fun
<GOOD> I wonder what I did, she usually at least talks to me once
<GOOD> And I was helping her with work yesterday and she asked me to today as well
<GOOD> She left at the end
<GOOD> And she was talking with other friends on the way back and didn't say shit to me when I walked past
<GOOD> So I'm just kinda done
<GOOD> Idk I'm just frustrated
<GOOD> Ok she was upset just not because of me
<GOOD> But mod abuse is fun
<GOOD> Cata needs to be taught to blast people out of existence for no reason
<GOOD> Thanks Luffy
<GOOD> Also nobody told me the epic life hack of having your comfort characters boss you around to make you do stuff
<GOOD> Me when Pearl Sploon tells me to get out of bed
<GOOD> I'm not attracted to any of my comfort characters
<GOOD> The hottest ones there are men and I don't like men
<GOOD> Takes hundreds of hours
<GOOD> Or something
<GOOD> Or just bought the GotY then never got around to it
<GOOD> I need to buy BG3 tbh
<GOOD> Just because I love Dnd
<GOOD> I wanna mod the game to add more races
<GOOD> Crow person
<GOOD> I'm gonna have to optimise so much to run BG3 man lmaoooo
<GOOD> Might buy another 8GB stick
<GOOD> I think the dude selling my PC took one out lmao
<GOOD> Fair enough
<GOOD> Well it only has 1 8GB stick
<GOOD> Show desk build
<GOOD> What kind of screws do that baby got
<GOOD> ZERO cooling, it's a hotbox in there
<GOOD> There is NO air circulation
<GOOD> You must turn it off every 5 minutes or it melts
<GOOD> Or blow on it a bit
<GOOD> You do not have no cooling
<GOOD> Don't you put it in a thin bit on the top
<GOOD> Idk how cooling paste works
<GOOD> I just know if you put too much it insulates it and melts it
<GOOD> Ngl if you gave me the paste and the cpu I wouldn't know what to do
<GOOD> I'd probably eat it or put it around the sides
<GOOD> I am already tech illiterate I cut my last PSU out of the case because of how shittily it was installed
<GOOD> And it was unsafe so I had to get it out
<GOOD> It had wires crammed between the motherboard and the case in a way where they just wouldn't come out without dismantling the whole thing
<GOOD> And it was an insane bootleg PSU so we just cut the wires and ripped it out
<GOOD> This was the PSU btw
<GOOD> Apparently it was 2000w
<GOOD> Aka the PC came with a bomb built in
<GOOD> It has a 96% efficiency dw
<GOOD> I need to clean my PC actually
<GOOD> Uh do I need a compressed air can for this
<GOOD> Can't use a rag
<GOOD> My PC has 2 fans
<GOOD> Roughly?
<GOOD> Schrodinger's fan
<GOOD> Picking up an air duster from asda Wednesday ig
<GOOD> I have 3 fans but 1 just isn't hooked up to anything I don't think lol
<GOOD> The 2 on the front run fine but the one on the back is static, which is fine
<GOOD> Idk shit about PC building ngl
<GOOD> Only thing I've done is replace the PSU
<GOOD> No idea what I'm gonna do when I have to replace other parts
<GOOD> Ngl I want this funky ass ram stick out of my PC
<GOOD> It has this stupid ass RGB strip that glows 24/7
<GOOD> If they don't know
<GOOD> Speaking of vegas
<GOOD> I need to play new vegas for the first time
<GOOD> What else would I even say, I'm trans ofc I'd talk about Fallout in a discussion about Vegas
<GOOD> Does he know?
<GOOD> I thought it was just trans in general
<GOOD> But what if I end up liking NV
<GOOD> Where are the games for the enbies :((
<GOOD> No they like hidden gems like Celeste
<GOOD> But I don't like witcher 3
<GOOD> Hop off gachapon
<GOOD> Gambling is awesome
<GOOD> Answer my riddles....
<GOOD> All of the transfems
<GOOD> Which studio ghibli food opinion got you like gmail perc the old fashioned way
<GOOD> SCP discussion I get to show this incredibly stupid video again
<GOOD> It makes me laugh too much
<GOOD> I feel off ngl
<GOOD> Think my brain is starting to get tired of being single and alone
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Vats but it doesn't vat
<GOOD> You love what now?
<GOOD> When I played Fo3 I got pissed off at durability
<GOOD> Simply will mod durability out
<GOOD> Yeah but I didn't
<GOOD> I stopped scrolling waifuism it made me sad
<GOOD> Like it was funny for a sec then it was just really depressing
<GOOD> Some of the posts look really funny since they'll show a tomadachi life mii or smth
<GOOD> Weak, I need competitive homophobia
<GOOD> Homophobia DLC?
<GOOD> What game
<GOOD> Why was it homophobic
<GOOD> Reminds me how someone I know now thinks Strive and Splatoon are heterophobic because I called the communities queer and toxic
<GOOD> Bro hates this meme
<GOOD> Who up hating they meme rn
<GOOD> I think this might be my favourite one
<GOOD> Parappa bias
<GOOD> WAIT WHAT
<GOOD> JOJO FORTNITE CROSSOVER
<GOOD> They added Jolyne to fortnite
<GOOD> Could definitely be that
<GOOD> I think Persona also had homophobia in 3
<GOOD> They took it out of the remaster I think
<GOOD> Or was that transphobia idk
<GOOD> This Ultra Kill guy kinda cool....
<GOOD> I've done all the normal content
<GOOD> Apparently at least
<GOOD> I love Dan Hentschel man
<GOOD> He's so cartoonish
<GOOD> I fucking love this guy
<GOOD> He's from everything
<GOOD> I love this dude he's like Roger from American Dad
<GOOD> What a trooper
<GOOD> I can't imagine how hard it must be to deal with so many problem patients
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> He's such a good therapist
<GOOD> The fact that he's never broken character once is hysterical
<GOOD> Like he RPs as such an awful person and literally never backs down
<GOOD> My favorite thing is when his bait is so serious that people fall for it and it just happens again and again
<GOOD> He uses a lot of makeup and wigs and stuff
<GOOD> He does look like entirely different people every time tho
<GOOD> The therapist personality is definitely my favourite
<GOOD> Reminds me I need to continue Frieren
<GOOD> Is there a word for when people describe things like a disease or something and it makes your hands feel weak and you can't write
<GOOD> They're describing Malaria/sickle cell and this video + the descriptions are killing me
<GOOD> I don't feel ill
<GOOD> I just feel weak
<GOOD> I can't grip anything properly
<GOOD> And the video has fucking blood rushing and heart beat noises why would you add those for no reason
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> My hand feels kinda limpish
<GOOD> I have no idea what it is but it happens semi frequently
<GOOD> Odd thing is that describing extremely grotesque things might not trigger it but talk about blood cells bursting or brain damage and I'm like hhhhh
<GOOD> Idk if it's just blood for me
<GOOD> But yea it sucks I'm trying to take notes
<GOOD> I have another 2 hours of this lecture then a 3 hour one after
<GOOD> Might just keel over
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Bruh it still hasn't gone away
<GOOD> I hate u mosquito
<GOOD> I rlly shouldn't have googled this hand weakness thing
<GOOD> I don't have carpal tunnel I am not having a stroke
<GOOD> I'm so fucked on this Malaria thing bruh
<GOOD> So many terms
<GOOD> I'm not avoiding a medical professional if my hands feel weak because I heard about something that triggers thaf
<GOOD> Strokes don't happen because someone describes malaria to you
<GOOD> And carpal tunnel is a constant thing that I don't possess
<GOOD> Ok but I've felt this feeling suspiciously every single time that I've had something like this described to me
<GOOD> It's a pattern, if it happens to line up exactly with a stroke then ig I'll die lol
<GOOD> Unfortunate luck
<GOOD> Already looking at my face, I am not having a stroke
<GOOD> And my speech is ok
<GOOD> It's just the hands
<GOOD> Not if I have my phone camera on, no?
<GOOD> Like I'm just looking at myself on my phone and I look fine
<GOOD> But my sight isn't impaired rn
<GOOD> It hasn't changed from when I woke up
<GOOD> Yeah me not being able to smile is because I'm depressed not because deatb is imminent
<GOOD> Ehhh it's only some cases
<GOOD> Like a ton of blood? Sure idm
<GOOD> But if it's a small amount that hits that certain niche then hhhhh
<GOOD> Never in my life have I been bitten by a mosquito afaik
<GOOD> And I'm still a they
<GOOD> Spoon do you show the course you're on yet
<GOOD> Like basically every scene with Catgrass in Jojo
<GOOD> Air bubbles in the vein is a huuuuuge no no I was so weak reading those scenes
<GOOD> Oh right that's the name
<GOOD> I just call it catgrass
<GOOD> But yeah the bubble scenes and the toenail thing made me ick
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> I might have made it up ngl
<GOOD> I'm in a lecture *about* Malaria
<GOOD> It's just making me very uncomfy
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> Maybe but I don't feel ill
<GOOD> Could be
<GOOD> Yeah that and any unnatural bleeding scenes made me uncomfy
<GOOD> Like the pressure house in part 8, the rods in part 6, Metallica in part 5
<GOOD> I need to play FNV later
<GOOD> Also Spoon is this gonna be you
<GOOD> Do you know Roger from American Dad
<GOOD> He's like that if he was real
<GOOD> He has a bunch of personas he flips through
<GOOD> Also he never breaks character which is really funny
<GOOD> He also looks like vastly different across different posts
<GOOD> There's a video where he's just like if you can't get ADHD people to do something, emotionally guilt trip them into doing it because then it's emotional and not logical and it left his target audience, and he STILL doubled down on it
<GOOD> Absolutely self destructive behaviour but I have to respect not breaking the bit
<GOOD> Literally my favourite guy on twitter
<GOOD> He's also the MY STUDENTS ARE ALL MORONS guy
<GOOD> It's just him screaming in his car
<GOOD> I felt called out by it
<GOOD> I don't even know if I have ADHD I'm probably just lazy as shit and have bad memory
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is focal issues also one of them because I'm ngl I'm so vacant sometimes and it might also just be laziness but idk
<GOOD> I should stop trying to self diagnose actually that's kinda stupid
<GOOD> Of me at least
<GOOD> Yeah like just staring off or being completely absent very very very often
<GOOD> The take I assume
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Still not a privilege to be diagnosed though people can't help who they are
<GOOD> Or how the system is
<GOOD> Hhhh I hate feeling like I'm just jumping to conclusions about my mental
<GOOD> But I can't rlly get an evaluation rn
<GOOD> IP grabber????
<GOOD> So many hackers
<GOOD> That fucking trope in kid's movies that I hate when the villain being evil is in their company's name or symbol or something stupid as shit
<GOOD> I trust Spoon to give me as much meth as he thinks I need
<GOOD> I mean prescription drugs
<GOOD> Sure if he can write that
<GOOD> I'm just as incoherent as I've always been
<GOOD> Can I have a smidge more than a teensy bit
<GOOD> I should really get some sort of evaluation ngl
<GOOD> Idrk how to do it or access it since the last time I bought up the possibility of being autistic to my mom she laughed and said if you were autistic I think you'd know
<GOOD> I've been thinking about my childhood a bit recently and realised every time I did anything that was known to be an autistic behaviour like walking on my tiptoes for no reason and general other kid behaviours I was called weird and told to stop loudly by my dad lol
<GOOD> I've never even brought it up to my dad because he thinks the only thing amiss with me is that I'm not like him
<GOOD> Yeah he absolutely is
<GOOD> I think I walked on my toes all the time because I wanted to be Lucario actually iirc
<GOOD> But yeah he got mad enough to make me stop by just yelling enough so
<GOOD> Womp womp
<GOOD> Walking on your toes has been linked to autism partially afaik
<GOOD> But it's not definitive at all
<GOOD> Nah we had a dentist my dad is just shitty behind closed doors
<GOOD> He's a narrow minded guy, he's been on my ass recently telling me that my university is trying to brainwash me with conflicting things to what he fed me for like 14 years with no other input bc no social
<GOOD> Made the mistake of once telling him I started listening to a horror podcast
<GOOD> I wonder what podcast he'd recommend
<GOOD> And he did recommend it
<GOOD> Right on the money
<GOOD> Oh damn it really is almost 40% as of 2022
<GOOD> At least from a quick google
<GOOD> I wonder if he's aware Joe Rogan has had a random abrupt switchup that's getting him attacked by his own fanbase
<GOOD> Funny asf to see
<GOOD> I mean it's Joe Rogan so if you're a balding middle aged white dude then sure
<GOOD> My dad is the target audience
<GOOD> Early 40s, balding average pubgoer type
<GOOD> He used to go to the gym but now he just talks about renewing his gym membership
<GOOD> Eh maybe but there's also like a billion other podcasts
<GOOD> I have a horror one in the background while I work
<GOOD> It's more like an audiobook tho
<GOOD> It's structured so idk
<GOOD> Yes please I haven't had good cocoa in forever
<GOOD> Literally my favourite treat to have some good shortbread and good cocoa
<GOOD> I'm hungy rn
<GOOD> Still in a lecture and stressed as FUCK tho
<GOOD> Usually 2 hours but I have 2 3 hours today
<GOOD> They bundle a 2 hour and a 1 hour together
<GOOD> At least I only have 1 tomorrow then none the rest of the week because it's winding down now tho
<GOOD> Yeah 10 minutes or so
<GOOD> Hot Ones but instead you give me exorbitant amounts of prescription drugs
<GOOD> I wanna try contacts
<GOOD> Fent
<GOOD> My mom works at the optician's
<GOOD> So I don't think that'll be the case
<GOOD> I get a glasses discount too
<GOOD> Jealous
<GOOD> Also Alaska Sanrio has taken root in my brain slightly but idk anything about them except how cool some of the characters, colour schemes and the general aesthetic is :((
<GOOD> Idk what the name of the aesthetic even is
<GOOD> That pastel, very plush type aesthetic
<GOOD> Kinda like this one yugioh archetype
<GOOD> If you just say the woke causes ___ you can get a following of teens with pepe pfps
<GOOD> The Woke causes tiktok
<GOOD> It's all connected...
<GOOD> Based on their design ye but I haven't seen them before
<GOOD> That penguin with a bow tie and Kuromi are my favourites so far
<GOOD> Omg
<GOOD> That's an amazing name
<GOOD> Dreamy cute enby perhaps...
<GOOD> Definitely one of my favourite aesthetics, kirby does it sometimes
<GOOD> Ok but this one is awesome
<GOOD> Ok last ones but these are awesome
<GOOD> I wish...
<GOOD> I want a baby blue or pastel pink big fluffy robe
<GOOD> I don't know fei fong wong unfortunately
<GOOD> NOW BOY I SAY BOY WHY ON EARTH WERE YOU THROWING ALL THOSE FANCY ATTACKS FOR, SON? WITH GUM GUM THIS AND GUM GUM THAT, YOU GOT GUM FOR BRAINS TOO? I SEEN EARS OF CORN THAT SNAP SLOWER THAN YOU BOY
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> Yeah I googled but like idk that guy so I can't make a foghorn leghorn ramble
<GOOD> That's cool af
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> He looks like a Great Ace Attorney character for some reason
<GOOD> Spoon I joined the beyblade society at my uni
<GOOD> I need to buy one
<GOOD> Sanrio beyblades...
<GOOD> I'm building my bey soon
<GOOD> I might just order 1 blade rn then add parts later
<GOOD> I was a bakugan child
<GOOD> Never played the game with anyone tho
<GOOD> Also Ace Attorney mentioned this gives me an excuse to send this again
<GOOD> It's really funny how this line predates the internet culture around the harlem shake so it just got better as time went on
<GOOD> Like why did he say that
<GOOD> It's awesome it has yaoi
<GOOD> In fact it's like 90% yaoi and 10% content
<GOOD> Also you have to interrogate a parrot
<GOOD> Which is awesome
<GOOD> I thought this was gonna be one of those content farm pingas edits tbh
<GOOD> Sleeper agent has been activated I can no longer hear the word dinner in a regular context
<GOOD> I feel so old rn even though I'm younger than you
<GOOD> It's like a gunshot in a quiet forest
<GOOD> I wish I could sentence mix
<GOOD> Or edit anything
<GOOD> My mom still calls people sus
<GOOD> I need Zelda CDi and Hotel Mario to come back in a big way
<GOOD> Apparently a zelda cdi inspired game released recently
<GOOD> Marshmallow is canonically NB in Annoying Orange I think
<GOOD> Like no fucking around they said it to the camera
<GOOD> It's called Arzette and the jewel of Faramore I think
<GOOD> Peak
<GOOD> Aesthetic
<GOOD> Nah it takes a lot to become a comfort character (unless you wear a jester hat or outfit then you get in for free)
<GOOD> Or maybe it's just because Pomni and Marx are just awesome like that
<GOOD> (Marx especially I wanna kiss Marx)
<GOOD> Give him a big old hug
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I heard there was a Touhou jester so I wanna look at that
<GOOD> Also Pomni has been ruined for me by this video /j
<GOOD> TADC being picked up by content farms is predictable but sad
<GOOD> The SCP turns into the thing you find most attractive
<GOOD> Absolutely unhinged clip attached tho
<GOOD> Idk apparently she's like 25
<GOOD> And her body is a rubberhose kinda cartoon since they all have weird ass bodies (I just find her cute and relatable tho)
<GOOD> I love the 2D art for her
<GOOD> Hmmm drawing idea I can't do but really really want to
<GOOD> Multiple in fact
<GOOD> Sephiroth we don't need to kill this guy but I really really want to!!!!
Splendid.
<GOOD> (The other guy is The Noise)
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> My chem teacher just said in bio you might do ethics assessments for killing animals but in chem we don't and I almost broke out laughing
<GOOD> I love bluntness
<GOOD> I haven't played battle network does he really say this
<GOOD> I love Wreck it Ralph!!!
<GOOD> Why does my brain only think right when it tortures me in my dreams man that thing is evil
<GOOD> I think Captain 3 was my breaking point
<GOOD> I saw them and just went Fuck. And like 2 weeks later I came out
<GOOD> Splatoon itself gave me enough to think about
<GOOD> The way Splatoon's society is structured is a very do what you want vibe
<GOOD> The only sex difference between inklings is literally just small flecks on their eye mask
<GOOD> And a lot of them just have a general enby vibe
<GOOD> Most of Splatoon's cast aren't kids
<GOOD> All of the idols, 3 in every appearance after their first, Acht, etc
<GOOD> 8 in Side Order also is 18
<GOOD> They just are built like that, Pearl is like mid to late 20s
<GOOD> Old ass
<GOOD> Also Splatoon is the queerest Nintendo franchise it's nearly inevitable something would have happened if my fragile but slowly opening cishet brain played it
<GOOD> We have the lesbian couple DLC unfortunately
<GOOD> Literally just like an hour of flirting with the floors in between
<GOOD> People still deny it when this dialogue exists
<GOOD> Oh then Side Order dropped one of my favourite enbies ever
<GOOD> The week Side Order released people were bombarding homophobes with pictures of the antagonist lmao
<GOOD> I know what you are
<GOOD> TN: hitting on means friendly jostling
<GOOD> Pearl is my favourite idol
<GOOD> Ok final one but
<GOOD> NOOOOO
<GOOD> SALMON VIRUS CANON
<GOOD> I headcanon that tbh
<GOOD> Also apparently it's octolings only
<GOOD> Yeah ppl headcanon Shiver as trans
<GOOD> Which honestly I can see
<GOOD> She a cool rep
<GOOD> Eh some people like thinking up cool lore for their games
<GOOD> Or any media really
<GOOD> Idrc, it's not usually a problem
<GOOD> Ok that's an entirely different thing lol
<GOOD> Plus shipping is the sign of a healthy fandom, Kagurabachi's fandom is trying to hire as many yaoi shippers as possible rn
<GOOD> They found the secret
<GOOD> Kagurabachi will last 1000 years with enough men kissing
<GOOD> Flourishing fandoms attract shipping apparently
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is an oddly welcoming shonen community
<GOOD> Like literally the least toxic anime fandom I've seen
<GOOD> It has been on the cover of WSJ and already has escaped its pool of manga it was introduced with
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is currently growing at like an obscene rate
<GOOD> Person who hasn't read Kagurabachi being asked about Chihiro
<GOOD> Yeah they don't have to read mid
<GOOD> If you're referring to Dragon Ball then I'm good lol, it has aged poorly
<GOOD> Pre Z Dragon Ball?
<GOOD> Bulma dropping a homophobic slur in the translation I read was wild
<GOOD> Also Kagurabachi isn't really edgy
<GOOD> I love u Chihiro
<GOOD> He mogs your favorite
<GOOD> Goku can't even beat Vegeta lmaoooo
<GOOD> Get him past his own verse
<GOOD> I'm current actually
<GOOD> Goku had to jump Vegeta in Saiyan Saga and still died
<GOOD> He has never won against Vegeta
<GOOD> There is not a single time that Goku actually beats Vegeta in a 1v1
<GOOD> And Vegeta has won against Goku multiple times
<GOOD> Including the most current variation of them
<GOOD> Oh also Gohan sucks get his name outta here
<GOOD> Wasted character development headass
<GOOD> Also Chihiro is an empathetic dude
<GOOD> He isn't even that edgy he just lost his dad lol
<GOOD> Yeah especially when uh
<GOOD> Ummmmm
<GOOD> Uhhhhhhhhhh
<GOOD> Blood?
<GOOD> He literally doesn't even do that he just uses his ability and kills them
<GOOD> Because that's what he was there for and they were gonna kill him if he didn't
<GOOD> I can't believe a manga has death........
<GOOD> Didn't know wearing a black outfit is now the only prerequisite to being edgy
<GOOD> Also the art is insane
<GOOD> Yeah it's so edgy because uhhhhhhh
<GOOD> Ummmm
<GOOD> Hmmmmmmm
<GOOD> Dark colours
<GOOD> I honestly can't tell if you're just trying to piss me off more or not
<GOOD> Like you can actually develop that idea into a criticism if you think hard enough but it just boils down to it has blood and dark colours
<GOOD> Like if you make a manga about katanas and black market dealings, you are understandably going to have blood and dark clothing lol
<GOOD> Especially when these katanas split people in half because of their strength
<GOOD> Yoooo so edgy because
<GOOD> Ummmmmm
<GOOD> Uhhhhh
<GOOD> Yeah what edgy shitty art
<GOOD> My argument being destroyed when the difference between having any sense of dark tones and edgy is so blurred people don't know the difference
<GOOD> Like?
<GOOD> Goodnight Punpun isn't edgy because it has dark themes
<GOOD> Yeah, so articulate on what makes it edgy
<GOOD> He just missed his strong ass attack he has to charge iirc
<GOOD> So tell me
<GOOD> If you have eyes and can articulate it, tell me
<GOOD> It shouldn't be that hard
<GOOD> Fairly sure his arms were injured/necessitated he hold it with his teeth since he was jumped
<GOOD> And he was being sent flying around floating rocks
<GOOD> Yeah out of respect for his dad and for general greater good because the katanas are powerful
<GOOD> If he didn't it would just fall into black market dealings and cause a war
<GOOD> Kinda does actually because edgy is when it becomes over the top or unnecessarily so
<GOOD> Oh so edgy is when swords and black, gotcha
<GOOD> Have you fucking read it
<GOOD> If you've read 1 shonen manga you've read them all
<GOOD> There is no variation in any shonen manga and you could never have misconceptions about something before consuming it
<GOOD> Ok so if you learned enough, what is Chihiro like
<GOOD> That isn't blood
<GOOD> Red from his goldfish
<GOOD> It literally looks like this
<GOOD> This is not bloodlike
<GOOD> Having wisps of it doesn't make it look like blood it's just red smoke
<GOOD> Also Sojo isn't even crazy there he's just smiling
<GOOD> His eyes are normal, he's confident but he isn't crazy
<GOOD> His eyes are just that width when he isn't absolutely sleepy as hell
<GOOD> Because he just wants it back
<GOOD> Yeah because obviously swords would have blood on it if this dude were out murdering dozens of people
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> Reminder that Crocodile in One Piece has killed dozens of people
<GOOD> So has Buggy
<GOOD> Buggy is an edgy character?
<GOOD> Kagurabachi (this manga) is bad because it's edgy
<GOOD> Also having a manga where the actual katana fight ends in like 1 attack finally is awesome
<GOOD> Or like, a handful of attacks
<GOOD> Edgy is only gratuitously dark, for example Berserk is only edgy because a lot of what it does is unnecessarily dark and violent even for its setting
<GOOD> It has a Torture arc
<GOOD> But honestly Black Swordsman is the only time it felt over the top
<GOOD> Yeah it's rlly good but it's still unnecessary at times
<GOOD> Killing is edgy??
<GOOD> Every shonen is edgy now
<GOOD> Luffy my edgy MC....
<GOOD> Yeah but murder isn't something that should be considered edgy as conteng
<GOOD> That just discourages from people considering writing about it
<GOOD> Like Goodnight Punpun handles violence in a mature and devastating way
<GOOD> It's grounded but it's not edgy
<GOOD> Idk feels like having all violence under edgy is splashing a bit too much
<GOOD> That one phone from Splatoon tries to kill inklings
<GOOD> I don't think that having all morally corrupt characters as edgy is good like
<GOOD> Buggy fires a canon at a block of houses and he is the least edgy man I've ever seen
<GOOD> Or like collapses a pet store because he's petty
<GOOD> There's a line between upsetting, violent and edgy
<GOOD> And? It has KILLING
<GOOD> It also has slavery
<GOOD> And famine and forcing people to work in mines until they starve to death
<GOOD> And shooting children
<GOOD> And bombing islands
<GOOD> And government censorship
<GOOD> And the ethics of nuclear weapons if we're talking Vegapunk
<GOOD> And experimenting on children with chemical weapons
<GOOD> And a whole arc about racial inequality
<GOOD> And a torture prison made specifically for sugfering
<GOOD> Dude
<GOOD> The second Chihiro saves a child from dangerous people he buys her ice cream and they chat
<GOOD> Chihiro does what he does because he loves his dad and doesn't want people to die and misuse what he created for an intention he didn't want
<GOOD> This is brought to the audience in the first main fight of the entire series
<GOOD> She so silly
<GOOD> Also the author is silly he just makes up words in responss to the community making up words
<GOOD> I want one of these big ass eye goldfish
<GOOD> The one chi yu is based on
<GOOD> Might be the name idk
<GOOD> Yeah this
<GOOD> I actually need to continue the latest KB arc
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> I searched big eye goldfish and this came up
<GOOD> I like them like that they're cute
<GOOD> Aughggg I hate brain
<GOOD> Not my day
<GOOD> I can't even draw my own art rn let alone big projects
<GOOD> Bro wtf
<GOOD> For an author just starting out this dude is awesome
<GOOD> Damn my hair has no lift rn
<GOOD> Leaving the team to escape war art responsibility
<GOOD> The Foghorn Leghorn meme has reached an actual VA for the character
<GOOD> I love them
<GOOD> Edgy but good
<GOOD> And with ample tonal shifts
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Also they just hit chapter 30
<GOOD> So congrats to Kagurabachi for living through the WSJ startup mangaka culling
<GOOD> Also the dude has a soft spot for kids he always saves them
<GOOD> I'm upset yahaha
<GOOD> Tired of being single because all of my friends have partners and I'm constantly being aired or cancelling plans because they're spending time w them, which is horrifically bitter of me but idc because I'm pressed about it
<GOOD> Oh and my brain gave me nightmares where I enjoyed time with every past friend I had that were shitty to me and that made me miss them
<GOOD> Even though most of them were liars, manipulators or just didn't care about me lol
<GOOD> So that was fun
<GOOD> I'm just so tired of being alone bruh
<GOOD> I stopped for a bit and then realised I was really bored because I had no one to talk to that often
<GOOD> Then I tried to make plans and they were busy with their partners so I'm back here lol
<GOOD> My best friend allegedly wants to hang out today but we'll see how that goes, she's in VC with her bf rn
<GOOD> All of my friends have turned out to be manipulators or liars so I'm very cynical about that
<GOOD> Unfortunately not cynical enough to not trust people again because I'm a dumbass
<GOOD> >have turned out to be
<GOOD> I am not trusting of many friends
<GOOD> 200k volumes of Kagurabachi have been sold
<GOOD> Very teno
<GOOD> It only has 2 volumes
<GOOD> There are 4 Xenoblade X players apparently all still online w each othwr
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> There are 11 players amongst diff games
<GOOD> 2 in MK7, 1 in Splatoon, 4 in XCX, 1 in Wii Sports Resort, 1 in MK8
<GOOD> Uhhh idk the rest
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> They're livestreaming it too iirv
<GOOD> They recently got booted from like actual lobby matchmaking but the stores and shit are updating and the announcements are coming jn
<GOOD> They just never turned off their wii u
<GOOD> Like they've been on 24/7
<GOOD> Iirc one of the last ones had a power cut which DC'd them
<GOOD> But ye there's 11 or so left
<GOOD> I think 1 is in pokemon Y but idk
<GOOD> The list
<GOOD> Of all documented people at least
<GOOD> That's interesting
<GOOD> I never got much of the squid sisters but I like Marie for telling Callie to die over saying she likes the map rotation
<GOOD> These bitches gay as hell, good for them, good for them!
<GOOD> I like the ones that include the detail of Foghorn briefly stopping shouting to blame someone for something like falling down
<GOOD> Goddamn
<GOOD> Very impressive model
<GOOD> Is this for a project or just renders
<GOOD> Hrmmm I'm bored
<GOOD> I wanna learn modelling tbh
<GOOD> I could make low poly....
<GOOD> I haven't even properly played Unleashed because as a kid I was stupid and couldn't beat like the 2nd level
<GOOD> So I just played the first Werehog stage over and over
<GOOD> Goddamn
<GOOD> Skill issue
<GOOD> Bro my flatmates left a half destroyed muffin on the floot
<GOOD> Wtf why would you even do that
<GOOD> Someone really wanted to make their SNES look right
<GOOD> DKC looks heat with CRT
<GOOD> And SMRPG
<GOOD> But what if instead i turned on Pixel Smoothing
<GOOD> I've never played on CRT
<GOOD> Yeah I just don't have any old consoles to hook it to
<GOOD> Uni accommodation means I have nothing here, but at home I have wii and gamecube
<GOOD> You can see the ball joints between the shoulder and body tho
<GOOD> It's just less pronounced than the others
<GOOD> The connector between the shoulder balls and the torso
<GOOD> Bounty likes pixel smoothing confirmed
<GOOD> The purple?
<GOOD> Samus doesn't have a purple helmet
<GOOD> Starting to look like a transvestigator image
<GOOD> Got the jawline out n shit
<GOOD> But ye Samus has a warm colour helmet, always has
<GOOD> Still very much connected to the torso
<GOOD> Still can't believe this is a real interview
<GOOD> Yeah lost levels sucks
<GOOD> Ok I could buy MGSV and Oneshot for 20 if I wanted
<GOOD> But idk what other games I could get
<GOOD> Like a Dragon is on sale too
<GOOD> Or I could buy P5R for 20
<GOOD> Good ass deal
<GOOD> Idk which to play first
<GOOD> It's only 4 rn so I decided to try
<GOOD> Idk I'm going in blind
<GOOD> Same for most of these games
<GOOD> I like hack and slashes sometimes
<GOOD> So bayo seems like a good cop
<GOOD> I almost bought P5R but eh
<GOOD> I wonder if that clip is TAS'd or not
<GOOD> Idk which game to play
<GOOD> Yeaahhhhh baby
<GOOD> I can't wait to play the remake as my first TTYD playthrough
<GOOD> Another 4 years of Bridget discourse
<GOOD> Also reply bombing bigots is always funny
<GOOD> Where did the audio go
<GOOD> In the OG translation she is changed from a trans girl to a cis girl
<GOOD> In this translation they're changing it to be more accurate it seems based on the dialogue we've seen
<GOOD> This dialogue aligns more with the JP translation compared to the original
<GOOD> Yeah it's tied to this dialogue from the original script
<GOOD> Jumpscare you say
<GOOD> Gdi I couldn't find that clip of Speed jumping into his setup with the withered foxy scream
<GOOD> Yeah just not discussing it is fun
<GOOD> Or using the most tame insults, I do that a lot because for some reason being called an unpleasant person strikes nerves more than whatever other insult I throw
<GOOD> Just watched the first cutscene of Bayonetta
<GOOD> This game funny asf
<GOOD> They do explain the holding thing
<GOOD> Just not the dodging afterwards to continue combo
<GOOD> Yeah they haven't so far
<GOOD> Anyway yippee 4 new games to play
<GOOD> Good deal tbh
<GOOD> Yeah that
<GOOD> That checks out
<GOOD> Even if she literally strips in the game
<GOOD> Also Bayonetta is hot (hot take ik)
<GOOD> Need to think of what comfort character and their close friend this is for me
<GOOD> Currently thinking Pearl and Marina
<GOOD> I still like the hell naw dog more
<GOOD> You can probably find it somewhere
<GOOD> Love this fucking video
<GOOD> HE-HELL NAW
<GOOD> What's the problem fixed by it
<GOOD> Idk how ultrawide is an issue
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> It's a joke
<GOOD> They gave that patch but it broke every mod
<GOOD> YOU'RE STILL PLAYING UNITE!?
<GOOD> Ngl not even that is enough to interest me anymore
<GOOD> They still only got 2 damn maps in the game lol
<GOOD> Do you really count quick play tho
<GOOD> So like how would I draw a fursona
<GOOD> I can't draw animals that well
<GOOD> Also are protogens strictly canines I've literally only seen dogs
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Can't download the homebrew channel on my sona what's even the point in living
<GOOD> Also the idea of them using nanites to create like living cells immediately makes my brain hum with I can make body horror out of this
<GOOD> And I don't like how often that comes up
<GOOD> My brain has horror on the mind frfr
<GOOD> Wdym closed
<GOOD> That seems like monopolising art lmao wha
<GOOD> Is it not the same as just making a character inspired by another tho
<GOOD> Yeah like I understand trading and buying specific OCs
<GOOD> But a whole species?
<GOOD> Damn I wish I could get it
<GOOD> I spent 28 today so I'm good
<GOOD> I might make a different tech inspired fursona so
<GOOD> Well later
<GOOD> Gonna be hard to think of tho
<GOOD> Hrm I'm bored
<GOOD> This OneShot game is sick
<GOOD> Ohhhh wait nvm
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> But ye I love this game
<GOOD> And will protect Niko with my life
<GOOD> Ok fuck this game it made me cry
<GOOD> Polite fellow
<GOOD> I don't wanna go back home
<GOOD> I'm gonna be bored as shit for months and around my dad
<GOOD> Banger music as always
<GOOD> I'm praying these are real
<GOOD> I need leaks in my life
<GOOD> Just found out this neuralink bullshit involves replacing a piece of your skull by drilling a hole in it lmao
<GOOD> Nobody told me I could pay for a lobotomy
<GOOD> Hooooly shit
<GOOD> For FREE!?
<GOOD> This analog horror shit funny af
<GOOD> (This series is dogshit apparently I'm not giving it the time of day)
<GOOD> Retro...
<GOOD> Freaky Mario Thousan Year Door
<GOOD> I can't think of character designs rn ouchies
<GOOD> I wanna draw characters for my world but putting it all together is hard
<GOOD> Anyone got some good ass games for consoles that are PS2 or weaker for me to emulate
<GOOD> I don't dislike FPS games, I just suck at them
<GOOD> And idk how goldeneye aiming is
<GOOD> Oh I got distracted
<GOOD> Bloodrayne?
<GOOD> I've never heard of that one, or shadowman
<GOOD> Might do Bayonetta before playing that
<GOOD> Oh damn
<GOOD> These are good recs I need some games I've either never heard of or never thought about
<GOOD> The phrase timesplitter just makes me think of that yugioh archetype
<GOOD> That's a big ass roster damn
<GOOD> Also I LOVE random silly modes
<GOOD> Skateboarding MGS2....
<GOOD> This seems fun
<GOOD> I'll probably download
<GOOD> When I can get the motivation to leave bed
<GOOD> Smash Brawl
<GOOD> It's looking better than someone
<GOOD> If you looksmaxx and mew enough baby gronk style with a side of skibidi, you too can mog someone and send them to Ohio
<GOOD> 1 letter away
<GOOD> And if you looksmaxx enough, one day you can rizzle that level 10 skibidi gyatt you've been chasing
<GOOD> D only rizzed up my style, I was bathed in the gronk
<GOOD> I actually understand everything except baby gronk
<GOOD> He's a social media guy and a sports guy I think
<GOOD> But it's just another word in the soup
<GOOD> You've been falling behind Marcel
<GOOD> You're becoming outdated
<GOOD> Your rizz? Level 1 at best. You'll be laughed out of the Mewing academy in a week. My level 10 rizz the ocky way? I've built a gyatt that will mew and prosper 1000 years.
<GOOD> Face it Marcel, you've been mogged.
<GOOD> My Pizza Tower will last millennia once I've fanum taxed every ounce of rizz in this server
<GOOD> What the bruh is wrong with you my fella
<GOOD> I'm simply trying to rizz the ocky way, hold the ohio with a huggy banban on the side
<GOOD> WAIT
<GOOD> I didn't read that message sorry
<GOOD> That sucks
<GOOD> Alas, no
<GOOD> I hope you feel better soon
<GOOD> Also I know this is random but ngl I feel like typing like a pirate so bad rn
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> I can't control for shit on keyboard
<GOOD> Oh also I've been made aware this image exists
<GOOD> And now I love it
<GOOD> Nobody can ever remove this image from my brain
<GOOD> If you couldn't handle me at me scallywag, then yer not deserving of me at me captaincy
<GOOD> Same vibe
<GOOD> Yeah he'd be like hi I'm Baldi, nice to meet ya
<GOOD> Huh?
<GOOD> Omg the dance
<GOOD> I haven't played the game yet Willow
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Idk that person-
<GOOD> I'm not a song people usually
<GOOD> ALSO ONLY LIKE 4 DAYS UNTIL PEAK
<GOOD> Bya

<GOOD> On a piano?
<GOOD> Yooooo
<GOOD> It's just TADC's orchestral theme
<GOOD> It was a score made for the episode
<GOOD> I have this on my phone too lol
<GOOD> PBG is in Strive
<GOOD> I grew up w jack and madk
<GOOD> Mark
<GOOD> Hell yeah
<GOOD> Bro didn't find the others funny
<GOOD> Boredom has led me to try Kingdom Hearts again
<GOOD> Time to try Yakuza 0
<GOOD> I didn't feel like it today
<GOOD> I just did the 25 minutes at the start
<GOOD> It's gonna be painful because I already did a few hours before
<GOOD> This yakuza 0 game kinda fun
<GOOD> This is... dame da good????
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> I had to restart because I don't have my old save where I quit at the jungle :((
<GOOD> I mean where else would I start
<GOOD> 1 is the first one
<GOOD> 1
<GOOD> Yeah I got bored and quit in the jungle last time
<GOOD> I can't take it no more
<GOOD> Reminds me how I basically got nowhere in GU because finding out what quests I needed to do annoyed me
<GOOD> Fun game tho
<GOOD> The bow......
<GOOD> Oh I see
<GOOD> Kinda annoying they weren't flagged thk
<GOOD> Tho
<GOOD> I think Mizutsune was the last monster I beat lmao so I didn't get far at all
<GOOD> I just got tired bc I kept doing quests and I must have done all of them except the key ones because literally nothing was happening lol
<GOOD> It happened
<GOOD> Sonic himself had to comw down and smite google play
<GOOD> No it's real
<GOOD> I don't blame them, ok short king
<GOOD> My head feels like it's full of oul
<GOOD> Oil
<GOOD> This happens often
<GOOD> It's not an illness thing
<GOOD> Well maybe mental
<GOOD> My flatmates are being weird again
<GOOD> They put tape on the peepholes on some of our doors and I can't think of why
<GOOD> It looks neat
<GOOD> It's oddly funny that my dad has said he's ok if I was gay before
<GOOD> Because like I know his ass wouldn't be, he immediately followed that up with but don't bring your boyfriend here
<GOOD> Bro is just upset for no damn reason too like I ain't even gay
<GOOD> And it shouldn't be a problem if I were
<GOOD> Sonic
<GOOD> Tbf I play Olimar and Snake I have no place to talk
<GOOD> KEEP HIS NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH HE IS A LOVING HUSBAND AND FATHER
<GOOD> HE WAS BUTCHERED BY SUBSPACE
<GOOD> Also I think Banjo is up there
<GOOD> Raising my hand to shit on boost era sonic
<GOOD> (I don't actually dislike boost Sonic)
<GOOD> I'm just mad about Banjo because his kit is lackluster
<GOOD> And I love Banjo
<GOOD> Olimar and Snake are my fave characters in the roster so I play them
<GOOD> Olimar feels just like I'm playing Pikmin
<GOOD> I used to play Inkling that was the rlly sad era
<GOOD> Inkling is more annoying than Olimar I think
<GOOD> Just because their best option is just to continue to camp you without ever getting close except to land bair
<GOOD> Because it's a snoozefest
<GOOD> I was just about to mention the racist mii gunner edit
<GOOD> What a coincidence
<GOOD> hardest response to being racist ever perhaps
<GOOD> Fairly sure my mii is just Neco Arc
<GOOD> Oh also just saying that the racist dude's Mii Gunner clips aren't good enough for me to forget he's racist
<GOOD> Yeah it fucking sucks which makes it funnier
<GOOD> Edgeguards not spicy enough to make me forget he said racial slurs
<GOOD> I'm more baffled this video isn't ironic tbh
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Launch launch, monsuno
<GOOD> Ready to battle, who wants to battle
<GOOD> Insane intro
<GOOD> The editing is so funny like this was uploaded in 2014 not 2004
<GOOD> Inazuma eleven intro is like that for me
<GOOD> One of my first anime
<GOOD> although in retrospect this one isn't quite as good lmfao
<GOOD> Ok I lied It's actually really bad but idc
<GOOD> Nostalgia clears
<GOOD> THAT ONE BANGS SO HARD
<GOOD> It's saved on my phone
<GOOD> My childhood trust
<GOOD> It still bangs today
<GOOD> Surely the rest of the series is this good!!!
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> I also went back to find this since this was also a childhood anime for me
<GOOD> But it reminds me of the fucking Evil Wizard thing because they keep saying Ultimate Muscle
<GOOD> Didn't have to go this hard
<GOOD> Arale only had no effect on Beerus and even he didn't actually hurt her
<GOOD> Need
<GOOD> I need a giant teddy bear to just eat
<GOOD> Because ngl if I had a giant teddy bear I'd act like a puppy with it (I would not actually put my mouth on it probably that's unsanitary)
<GOOD> Unfortunately
<GOOD> I am alone rn /neg
<GOOD> So no blanket
<GOOD> *no blanket stealing
<GOOD> Fried brain
<GOOD> Yea that's why I'm trying to get a big teddy bear
<GOOD> My friend has this big axolotl cylinder and it is life changing to hold
<GOOD> She gives it to me when I'm stressed around her and it works wonders
<GOOD> Mhhh too pricey for the size of bear
<GOOD> I think a generic one would be cheapest
<GOOD> UK, but yea I'll be poking around supermarkets
<GOOD> I've been having a bad streak so I feel icky today
<GOOD> Showering only takes like 15 minutes I should not require so much effort to do it
<GOOD> It's not even unpleasant, albeit for me it's a bit stressful
<GOOD> I have a thing with the shower
<GOOD> If the shower curtain is closed and obviously the noise of the shower running I get very anxious
<GOOD> Especially when I have to close my eyes to let water not run on them
<GOOD> Oh it's clear
<GOOD> Like I'd know if someone's there
<GOOD> It's just the idea that I'd be blinded and not be able to see or hear someone there
<GOOD> It's irrational bullshit but idk
<GOOD> That's how I feel about sensory deprivation in general tho, I'm deathly afraid of fucking hand dryers in empty washrooms
<GOOD> It's very embarrassing but it stresses me out to use them
<GOOD> I guess it's a loud noise in a quiet space situation but ye empty bathrooms make me uneasy
<GOOD> And again, loud noise = you can't hear someone coming
<GOOD> Trueeee
<GOOD> Genuinely even 1 person being around me helps so much
<GOOD> Not in the washroom ofc lmao
<GOOD> But like in general if I'm not alone I'm not afraid of people being in blind spots in doorways and stuff
<GOOD> Or outside my window or in my bathroom right now
<GOOD> But unfortunately I am alone right now so those fears are very real
<GOOD> I literally live on the 3rd floor for this reason but I'm still afraid
<GOOD> The window is like, behind my headboard
<GOOD> And when it's windy it makes noises like someone is scratching at it which makes me absurdly nervous
<GOOD> If it were under my contract to be able to move shit then the only option would be to place my bed facing towards the window but with my head right next to the door lmao
<GOOD> I wear an eye mask
<GOOD> Very helpful despite the obvious stupidity of being afraid of blindness but willingly putting one on
<GOOD> The bathroom door that is
<GOOD> With the exit being behind me
<GOOD> FnaF night ass setup
<GOOD> Foxy would absolutely be a window guy that works differently to the others coming in through the doors
<GOOD> This is how my view is when I sit up
<GOOD> But obv the flash isn't on rn
<GOOD> The closet is to the right there
<GOOD> So yea very stressful to be surrounded by entranceways
<GOOD> Yee
<GOOD> I don't have anxiety related to my flatmates at least despite how loud and bigoted they are lmao
<GOOD> Yeah that's a circular vent, it makes an air noise constantly
<GOOD> Like a rumbling air flow
<GOOD> It used to bother me but now it's a bit white noisey
<GOOD> I also have a thing where when I open my eyes I'll see something absolutely horrifying for a split second and if I blink it'll be normal
<GOOD> But like, there's no way the shit in my brain rationalises a bag on my cupboard as a crouching human being up there
<GOOD> That actually happened once I was scared af
<GOOD> But I think everyone has that tbh
<GOOD> They see monsters in the dark bla bla bla
<GOOD> Probably normal
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I'm honestly afraid it's hallucinations but I think it's just paranoia or smth
<GOOD> So much for sleeping
<GOOD> Yeah there's literally the cupboard, the actual door and the bathroom door all in 1 direction and then the Foxy window in the other
<GOOD> I think Bonnie and chica would spawn in the cupboard and bathroom respectively then Freddy would come through the entrance if you didn't constantly check if it was locked
<GOOD> And then foxy you have to make him fall as he slowly advances up the wall to the window behind you
<GOOD> (He advances in 5 phases where he's at the bottom, 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors and then reaching directly into your window)
<GOOD> Nah this one is pretty loud all the time, it's literally fnaf type fan ambience
<GOOD> Ignore the random flatmate sound at the end
<GOOD> Yeah I did when I went back around Christmas
<GOOD> Or when I'm in my friend's flat since hers is silent
<GOOD> It was the start of a sentence
<GOOD> Oh also that light circle is the peephole that constantly reminds me the door is right there
<GOOD> My flatmate put tape on it last night for some reason
<GOOD> That made me think a lot of things that aren't happening could be which was scary
<GOOD> But they were just pranking everyone I think
<GOOD> It's not like it's beaming in it's just a vague hole at the foot of my bed
<GOOD> Oh also my lightbulb has started flickering randomly so I've stopped using it
<GOOD> I should rlly email the services about that
<GOOD> Oh damn I rambled a lot about my dumb brain
<GOOD> Oopsie
<GOOD> Ngl it would be funny to buy a classic fnaf style flashlight for shits and giggles as well as convenience
<GOOD> I think that Nightmare Foxy would eat shit and die if I flashed him with a nice bright flashlight
<GOOD> Bro would fall to the bottom floor and die
<GOOD> God I need TJOC Reignited soon
<GOOD> Excuse me???
<GOOD> Oh it's potential loss
<GOOD> I can't ball any more
<GOOD> I can't take it
<GOOD> How many bottles is like a safe amount of cider
<GOOD> I think I might have 2 to keep safe
<GOOD> I think the brand I used to have is like 4%?
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> So weak sauce
<GOOD> Yea 4.5
<GOOD> What else would I be doing with cider
<GOOD> Old mout
<GOOD> So like not too big, maybe 2 glasses?
<GOOD> 500ml each apparently
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> Not in the mood to rationalise why I'm drinking I'm just gonna get 2 bottles
<GOOD> Unless there's a 3 for 2 deal
<GOOD> Alone, why
<GOOD> Not a fan of parties
<GOOD> Because I feel like shit and cider is kind of tasty and there's nothing else I can do about it
<GOOD> He right tho
<GOOD> Lol
<GOOD> Yeah I know
<GOOD> It's wildly self destructive to drink alone don't do it kids
<GOOD> I know, it wasn't sarcasm
<GOOD> Fine I'll get 1 bottle probably
<GOOD> TotK
<GOOD> Well not incredibly disappointing ig
<GOOD> It just feels like for the buildup TotK was just a good game
<GOOD> I heard a lot of people were a bit disappointed with crash 4 somehow
<GOOD> I enjoyed it tho
<GOOD> Hmmm
<GOOD> Would Dark Souls 2 count as a good game
<GOOD> Mmmm drugs
<GOOD> Raaaagh I'm unmedicated
<GOOD> And undiagnosed
<GOOD> Don't have access to a clinic or anything raaaagh and I've also already talked to you about how my parents think checkups are for me raaaagh
<GOOD> Tired
<GOOD> Burger
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Burger
<GOOD> Does anyone have any gigantic fluffy clothes they can show me as a reference
<GOOD> Like pajamas, robes onesies etc because I'm ngl google is shit for this
<GOOD> All of these robes are REGULAR SIZED!!!
<GOOD> New OC
<GOOD> Designing a horrific eldritch creature containing itself in fluffy slippers and PJs
<GOOD> It's just tough to search for how oversized clothes fit anyway
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I have learned to use the smudge tool
<GOOD> I saw this this morning for the first time and I lost my shit
<GOOD> Yyyaaaaayyyy
<GOOD> Yyaaaaaayyyy {johnnysmile}
<GOOD> I never wanna hear anything that reminds me of fnaf ever again after yesterday
<GOOD> (Kidding but the community is a shithole rn)
<GOOD> Multiple controversies + a poor response from Scott + a problematic person working for him quit
<GOOD> And it's been simmering for a while now with other smaller controversies
<GOOD> The person in question is a big problem + Scott's defense of them
<GOOD> And when the fnaf fandom gets riled up they do stupid shit
<GOOD> Is that bad?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Wait what why
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh are you on some privatised system
<GOOD> Idk how getting HRT works except on the NHS it takes forever
<GOOD> Bruh
<GOOD> So like, almost 7(?) Years
<GOOD> Is it even like an actual threat to your health
<GOOD> Or is it just the same as normal cramps
<GOOD> I meant specifically cramps induced by HRT
<GOOD> You guys don't lay eggs?
<GOOD> And fish
<GOOD> Gave myself a headache
<GOOD> Guh
<GOOD> Oh my god it's only been an hour????
<GOOD> Can this day end already
<GOOD> Where is the comic con
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I'm out for the rest of the week minimum anyway it seems
<GOOD> My mom keeps pushing me to go to Conwy or Chester but idk what to actually do there
<GOOD> And I can barely even leave my room
<GOOD> I don't doubt it but just go to Chester isn't a reason to go
<GOOD> Oooh
<GOOD> It's just hard to be interested in things that should be
<GOOD> Yea maybe a shopping trip and a food court is in order
<GOOD> I also want to cook some nice food but eh
<GOOD> Thinking of dishes is haes
<GOOD> Hard
<GOOD> I need a win so this food better be good frfr
<GOOD> I have been through Rhyl on the train
<GOOD> A few times
<GOOD> I'm so messed up for this chem test tbh
<GOOD> I haven't been able to revise because my brain feels awful
<GOOD> And it's on fucking Ochrm
<GOOD> Ochem
<GOOD> Tuesday
<GOOD> There isn't gonna be a rest day
<GOOD> Today is a rest day too, and yesterday, and basically this whole week
<GOOD> I'm not rested lol
<GOOD> Tf am I meant to do then
<GOOD> I mean I literally just spent all of today in bed minus a short shopping trip
<GOOD> I'd call that a rest day
<GOOD> I don't have mental rest
<GOOD> The more time spent with my brain the worse it is
<GOOD> I can assure you I've been thinking about something else all day
<GOOD> I've never played siege
<GOOD> The ubi game I put the most time into was For Honor
<GOOD> Ughhhhhhhhhh I don't wanna get out of bed
<GOOD> I want this day to end
<GOOD> At least I bought cake today instead of alcohol
<GOOD> Although rn I kinda fuckin wish I had some
<GOOD> I bought fudge cake because it took me 5 hours to coerce my brain into letting me leave bed and run an errand
<GOOD> I had to look again I thought it was a kebab
<GOOD> God I don't look great rn
<GOOD> Fucking
<GOOD> I hate ochem
<GOOD> They should love me instead
<GOOD> I'm certain fujos wouldn't mind drawing masc enbies
<GOOD> Oh also kagurabachi fans recently found out the JP Yaoi community is fucked up and they love it
<GOOD> Women that ship gay men
<GOOD> Like have you seen those ppl that ship Edgeworth and Phoenix Wright
<GOOD> NOOOOOOOOOO
<GOOD> I don't rlly see an issue with shipping tbh
<GOOD> Unless it's a ship that is problematic
<GOOD> I'm still losing it at the Kagurabachi fandom hiring fujos en masse because the cast is mostly dudes and they know it grows the fandom massively
<GOOD> Like they were partying in the streets when they saw men kissing
<GOOD> They literally had want ads out for people to ship Chihiro and the dude he works with
<GOOD> Honestly the most positive manga community I've seen
<GOOD> In the latest WSJ cover Chihiro was on one of the little stickers, and it was slightly larger than the last time and people were popping off
<GOOD> Found it, Bachibros popping off
<GOOD> He was smaller last time
<GOOD> Unironically I'm very happy KB is succeeding
<GOOD> It's so good
<GOOD> The plot is moving very fast tho, we're probably reaching the end of the first or second arc already
<GOOD> Depending on how you define an arc in KB
<GOOD> Marina and Pearl....
<GOOD> Tbf there is an infinite monkey theorem type thing with shipping where inevitably everyone will be shipped with everyone
<GOOD> Currently it just happens that Kagurabachi has like 3 female charactees
<GOOD> And the rest are men
<GOOD> Naw it happens with a lot of fandoms
<GOOD> And tbf every girl in KB so far as been respectful and a cool asf character
<GOOD> Like one of them has already almost beaten Chihiro head on
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> That actually helped it
<GOOD> It ballooned ironically then when it released the art was phenomenal and ppl loved it
<GOOD> And the fights we've had so far are clean, the pacing is good, and the characters are cool
<GOOD> Chihiro himself is already being a media literacy check lmao
<GOOD> Because mfs think he's just edgydude McBadguy
<GOOD> Oh also KB already has shit like this
<GOOD> So I think the fandom is safe
<GOOD> Kagurabachi (they are not together)
<GOOD> Goku isn't standing a chance against Chihiro tbh
<GOOD> What he gonna do when Chihiro uses Black
<GOOD> Or Red
<GOOD> He pulls it off tbh
<GOOD> Is it too hasty to say Kagurabachi is in my top 5 manga OaT
<GOOD> Like rn I think it's:
One Piece
HxH
Dungeon Meshi
Goodnight Punpun
Kagurabachi
<GOOD> Watch out Punpun.... Chihiro is coming....
<GOOD> Bachicord has so many emotes
<GOOD> Honestly I think Chihiro cuts down Punpun
<GOOD> What is Punpun gonna do? Cry???
<GOOD> I mean Frieren is creeping up my anime ranking
<GOOD> And if KB were a trend it would be being talked about everywhere
<GOOD> Chihiro is just HIM
<GOOD> No that's Dungeon Meshi
<GOOD> It got an episode yesterday
<GOOD> It has that sort of setting but with its own spin
<GOOD> It's mostly about food
<GOOD> And autism
<GOOD> Top 1 in Japan
<GOOD> And has been for most years in the last 25 or so
<GOOD> Dunmeshi has a lot of shipping too but that's just how the fandom is
<GOOD> Like if I search dungeon meshi in gif search the first result is unhinged
<GOOD> This dude is not a communist
<GOOD> There are many of these characters
<GOOD> SHUT UP I'M AFRAID GOKU IS GONNA GET ME
<GOOD> The 4kids dub wasn't Oda's fault
<GOOD> It was Toei's fault iirc
<GOOD> Or whoever distributed it
<GOOD> Iirc it was Sailor Moon or smth they added it to
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Dunmeshi is still blowing up tho
<GOOD> And JJK is getting less attention because it's mid
<GOOD> Gojo is a fraud, this is the year of Sojo
<GOOD> It's the year of Sojo
<GOOD> Even though he's dead
<GOOD> Wait this just means IT'S THE YEAR OF CHIHIRO AGAIN
<GOOD> MY GOAT
<GOOD> Why wouldn't I be
<GOOD> GOATCHIRO
<GOOD> Actually wait I mustn't slander JJK
<GOOD> Kagurabachi may be my favourite but respect for your fellow manga is more important... dattebayo...
<GOOD> Speedureadbachibros will say Chihiro was edgy for this...
<GOOD> Meanwhile the more keen eyed teno-analysbachibros will be enlightened as to his tragedy
<GOOD> Bro she's so cool

<GOOD> This is how my friends greet me tbh
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Aaaaa
<GOOD> It's all paper
<GOOD> Big Boss?
<GOOD> The man who sold the world...
<GOOD> I think a good start is to shoot him
<GOOD> I researched this for months around a year ago
<GOOD> It was very fun to present and teach ppl about
<GOOD> Actually I think it was about a month not multiple
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Bro this is fucking awesome
<GOOD> I feel drunk but it's usually just severe headfog
<GOOD> I feel like I'd be dead if that were the case
<GOOD> It happens often so I doubt it
<GOOD> And I do open my windows
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> I wanna be more fem
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> I might put off thinking about that for a bit
<GOOD> Fellas is my brain too far gone
<GOOD> Seems different to when I dissociate
<GOOD> Mine just feels like my brain is running too fast with too many thoughts and it gets clogged up and messy and keeps building and shaking and flowing until I can't take it and it feels like my head is bursting
<GOOD> Among other things
<GOOD> It's strange that your handwriting is the least legible part of this for me so far
<GOOD> I can't read other ppl's handwriting for shit
<GOOD> Omg samesies
<GOOD> Can I have your lemonade
<GOOD> Wait that's a mental illness thing?
<GOOD> I thought random pockets of hyperactivity was just something that everyone has
<GOOD> Just to a lesser extent than what I do-
<GOOD> I occasionally bruise my hands from stimming too rapidly and roughly
<GOOD> Because of being hyperactive
<GOOD> Like TADC yesterday made me hurt my hands and I was literally just jumping everywhere and running around my tiny ass room lol
<GOOD> Seeing stuff?
<GOOD> Oh perceptions of yourself not hallucinations
<GOOD> Naw I have times like that too where my perception of myself warps to something entirely inexplicable and different
<GOOD> I changed how I visualised it over time and it went from personality soup to books on a shelf to a gallery of masks and now I don't feel as stressed when I think about it
<GOOD> Yea I saw
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I'm not shaking anymore
<GOOD> Caine is funny asf
<GOOD> Bubble too
<GOOD> Honestly I like him more than befroe
<GOOD> He seems less tumblr sexyman and more Bender from Futurama now
<GOOD> Also they've set up Jax for later with the Kaufmo scene
<GOOD> I've already seen some Jax NPC theories kicking around where his nihilism is from the reality that he's not real
<GOOD> Gangle is in my top 3 of the circus members probably
<GOOD> Minus Cain and Bubble
<GOOD> Pomni is my favourite
<GOOD> Then Zooble and Gangle
<GOOD> I didn't like Zooble as much in ep 1 but I like her more in ep 2
<GOOD> Ep 2 has some amazing character moments
<GOOD> And then Bubble is Bubble lmao
<GOOD> So sticky! So *BLEEEEEEEEP*
<GOOD> I like how they didn't even use the silly censor
<GOOD> They just used a regular censor bleep
<GOOD> What did she say
<GOOD> Perhaps
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Welcome to the goddamn digital circus
<GOOD> My name is Caine, I am your bitch
<GOOD> This fucking frame blew my mind tbh
<GOOD> When this happened my jaw dropped
<GOOD> Goose mixed 2 of my hyperfixations together that is illegal
<GOOD> It's like mixing volatile chemicals
<GOOD> This is literally how our party is rn but we bonded over selfishness
<GOOD> And egotism
<GOOD> Reminder that boxing used to not even involve dodging
<GOOD> They would just beat each other up
<GOOD> stop please
<GOOD> Or I can mute you, your choice
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Idk Elder Scrolls or smth
<GOOD> I haven't done a thing today
<GOOD> I'm gonna watch a movie tomorrow tho
<GOOD> I need to watch Champloo
<GOOD> After Frieren and Guren Lagann
<GOOD> What this time
<GOOD> Yesterday I looked and Shadow the Hedgehog was talking to Eggman
<GOOD> OHHHHH
<GOOD> I saw a bit of that
<GOOD> Wait why are they fighting
<GOOD> Ohhhh I've seen
<GOOD> I think this is him frantically trying to keep her on the platform while keeping appearances on his engagement bait posts
<GOOD> Yea?
<GOOD> How are ppl still dunking on that one multiversus clip it's so funny
<GOOD> Isn't he a dragon
<GOOD> Although usually people just call him Shenron
<GOOD> Yeah he taught Ryu everything he knew
<GOOD> Yeah it's a famous conspiracy
<GOOD> It's just a misconception about his atfack name but people made fake articles back in the day about Sheng Long and unlocking him
<GOOD> It also got passed around and republished a lot by different game magazines
<GOOD> Wait were you joking and you already knew all this
<GOOD> Oopsie
<GOOD> L is real is one of my favourites
<GOOD> The gigaleak cemented it
<GOOD> Oh sorry
<GOOD> I just knew all this because it's in the same vein as Ermac
<GOOD> Except Ermac actually became a thing
<GOOD> Idk anything about Street Fighter but I love videogame urban legends and internet horror stories
<GOOD> Tbf Ermac looks cool as hell
<GOOD> I like the design they chose
<GOOD> But honestly Sheng Long is funnier because he never appeared in anything officially
<GOOD> He does look awesome
<GOOD> I wanna try SF 3rd strike tbh
<GOOD> It looks cool
<GOOD> And very fluid
<GOOD> Though tbh I'd probably main Akuma in every SF game
<GOOD> He's just that guy
<GOOD> Gill is also cool
<GOOD> And Q
<GOOD> I love characters that do shit like this
<GOOD> Ultimate weapon type characters like Kars
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> He cool
<GOOD> Gameboy Chun Li
<GOOD> Perfect for me
<GOOD> I can't combo anyway
<GOOD> I labbed Bedman combos in Strive but I know I'm never pulling them off in a real fight
<GOOD> I like 3rd strike's smoothness
<GOOD> Also the grappler dude
<GOOD> I wanna learn Bridget in Strive
<GOOD> Akuma is the most standout
<GOOD> For me at least
<GOOD> I loooooove these types of characters so much
<GOOD> Like uh Void Soul from Kirby
<GOOD> Watching him throw the same jumping overhead from neutral airdash is so funny
<GOOD> Like they're cracked as hell with this character but you can tell they don't have options lmao
<GOOD> Pot if being in advantage was also dogshit for him
<GOOD> Yo Arrowhead seems a lot more based than it seems
<GOOD> Apparently they're trying to strongarm Sony into removing the PSN requirement by provoking review bombs and refunds
<GOOD> Honestly I can respect it
<GOOD> They're a transparent company and they fully admitted they don't mind the negative reviews because it gives them ammo in discussions with Sony
<GOOD> I'm tired of this stupid hair
<GOOD> It grows back every 2 days I hate it I want it gone off my face
<GOOD> I'm never having money for that in my life methinks
<GOOD> I just hate this I wanna rip them out by the roots
<GOOD> Still expensive
<GOOD> And from what I understand impermanent
<GOOD> That's like an entire semester's rent or smth lol
<GOOD> They most likely get saddled in debt and paperwork and go bankrupt
<GOOD> Is that not because the action is through a PSN link
<GOOD> And not steam
<GOOD> Therefore they're easier to identify
<GOOD> None of the words you said were in what she said like
<GOOD> Well not in that order
<GOOD> We can handle player reports better now isn't we're happy our game is doing shit
<GOOD> Sheldon Cooper in shambles
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I thought this was the steve clip
<GOOD> THIS THING HAS A NAME???
<GOOD> I thought everyone had this happen why does this have a clinical name
<GOOD> It happens w me constantly over even the simplest things
<GOOD> Like I should watch that thing or I should go on a walk or I should play a thing is this not just laziness
<GOOD> That happened a few days ago when I literally couldn't leave bed ig
<GOOD> My friend made a plan to hang out and told me to go shower and get ready Because I hadn't done anything in days
<GOOD> She forgot about it but it did get me out of bed
<GOOD> Also I don't think anyone I know watches Frieren
<GOOD> Or like does the things I do or likes what I like
<GOOD> At this exact moment at least
<GOOD> Like nobody gonna tell me to play fucking Pikmin 3 Deluxe so we can talk about it
<GOOD> Yea but asking friends to do that seems hard
<GOOD> Coward
<GOOD> (Disclaimer I also hate feet)
<GOOD> He does such a comically large amount of damage I forgot how arcade fighters were
<GOOD> Like that round 2 was hilarious
<GOOD> Why did he just decide to do 3/4
<GOOD> Damn he looks like a cooler DJ than me
<GOOD> You must beat Sheng Long
<GOOD> His brother
<GOOD> I wanna draw Pomni
<GOOD> But I have to revise and go shopping
<GOOD> It has occurred to me I have introduced someone to the concept of bed rotting but without specifying it's a more specific situation than I felt like staying in bed longer and I don't wanna correct them
<GOOD> Like they just said I felt like rotting so I had breakfast at 12pm
<GOOD> Bro these cybertruck posts always send me
<GOOD> Like why are you still defending this
<GOOD> It reminds me of that Malcolm in the Middle episode where he's in like an abusive relationship with a car
<GOOD> It makes me annoyed I get genuinely mad when people don't like digital circus show when it's perfectly reasonable
<GOOD> Well it's fine to not like it but seeing switchup on the characters is annoying me even though it shouldn't
<GOOD> The chip damage being more than a shoryuken is hilarious
<GOOD> I was voice training and dicking around with the highest my voice could go and I made a yelping noise
<GOOD> I'm never doing a Flowey impression again that was embarrassing
<GOOD> I'm self conscious of it it sounds like a shitty fandub
<GOOD> Ridley
<GOOD> Also someone just sent this image to me
<GOOD> I have no fucking clue what it's meant to mean
<GOOD> It's like those Loud House fanarts
<GOOD> It's a British car (Ace Attorney reference)
<GOOD> ((The wheel is on the other side))
<GOOD> Yesh
<GOOD> Wario also uses child labour
<GOOD> He is also our NB GOAT because no one else matches the colour scheme that well
<GOOD> Also speaking of TADC and queers apparently gender non conforming ppl in general have claimed Zooble and like
<GOOD> Damn I love them
<GOOD> (It's not actually claiming it's just headcanon)
<GOOD> I still love their design tho
<GOOD> Ye facial hair
<GOOD> And brows and hair
<GOOD> No one else matches the colour scheme very well so we took Wario
<GOOD> Oh right it is
<GOOD> I love Wario anyway
<GOOD> Dipper wtf did I miss
<GOOD> Is this that same event
<GOOD> Solid Snake diff
<GOOD> I already main Snake this is inspiring
<GOOD> I have no idea how grenade cooking works tho
<GOOD> God I need more friends
<GOOD> (I'm really into Mario Kart and that's about it)
<GOOD> Do you need to shield drop to catch the grenade
<GOOD> Or some sort of tech
<GOOD> There are Gran Turismo missions where this happens I think
<GOOD> No slander to Acola but Steve looks so boring at times
<GOOD> Like the grenades w snake are so neat and Steve just
<GOOD> Wall
<GOOD> Yeah the grenade mixups are crazy
<GOOD> I'm good for now
<GOOD> Actually do you have any Banjo sets
<GOOD> Banjo is so funny man even at the highest level he looks bad
<GOOD> The dude is cracked af but he looks so off
<GOOD> Mad respect for not immediately burning wonder wing every time
<GOOD> Side b calls to Banjo players like the green goblin mask
<GOOD> Skill issue
<GOOD> /j but that's funny asf
<GOOD> Why does he do so much
<GOOD> What the hell is Hades
<GOOD> Also ya I just saw this
<GOOD> Very cool
<GOOD> I wonder if the direct will be on my birthday
<GOOD> BK DECOMP IS BEING UPDATED???
<GOOD> I also hope minecraft becomes TNT trolled
<GOOD> This Yakuza 0 kinda good...
<GOOD> It seems good so far
<GOOD> I suck at yakuza
<GOOD> Only in chapter 2 tho so I'll just learn lmao
<GOOD> 0
<GOOD> I just don't know how to break my attack chains lol
<GOOD> So I don't get packed up immediately
<GOOD> Also I think there's something unhealthy about just drawing and nothing else for 8 hours
<GOOD> My neck still hurts
<GOOD> It was worth it tho I made my new favourite art
<GOOD> Oh some dude just 2 shot me
<GOOD> I feel like that was an intended loss somehow
<GOOD> Gotta watch out for Giant Man frfr
<GOOD> Oh his name is Mr Shakedown
<GOOD> How nice
<GOOD> Hit them with the
<GOOD> Is it just about neutering cats or smth
<GOOD> I'm already so pissed about this discourse
<GOOD> Everyone got in their own heads about their headcanons for sarcastic sans tumblr sexyman jax and the second episode 2  continues doing exactly what he acted like in ep 1 people think it's character assassination
<GOOD> I literally can't not care about this show
<GOOD> My mom being like watch out for those peaceful protestors sitting on a patch of grass when you go out shopping today x is so funny
<GOOD> And sad
<GOOD> Idk they might suffocate me in a flag lmao
<GOOD> It's so funny because the person she heard it from said in their post that other student forums just didn't allow them to shittalk it and banned them
<GOOD> According to my friends my driver's license photo looks like that guy on meth
<GOOD> Are these proper joycons
<GOOD> God I want these badly
<GOOD> There were NES ones worldwide..?
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> Yeah but not all of these are joycons
<GOOD> Like you can't just slot them on
<GOOD> Is there even any game where that's applicable except like, overwatch
<GOOD> Very cool
<GOOD> Hold up but what if the 2 player game was split screen so if you sat on either side of the switch you each had a screen....
<GOOD> Does anyone know about kazuya smash bros
<GOOD> Can you confirm any attack out of his side b hitstun
<GOOD> Wasn't there because it's ass
<GOOD> Subspace army clears
<GOOD> That was my childhood
<GOOD> I'm never playing brawl ever again
<GOOD> Oh also I think I made people less comfortable around me at my gaming society by saying oh Snake my husband... I love u snake over and over while playing him in ultimate
<GOOD> I don't like Lucario
<GOOD> I did as a kid tho I walked on my toes to be like him until my dad yelled at me loud and often enough to make me stop
<GOOD> Naw I'm playing Snake and Olimar rn
<GOOD> I played Kazuya for a match and beat the brakes off everyone because he's busted in FFA
<GOOD> Guys I bought meatballs... I wonder what to make with them and how much of it...
<GOOD> What if I had MEATBALL with LOTSA SPAGHETTI for DINNER...
<GOOD> But I can only have MEATBALL as a treat because even though I'M SO HUNGRY I need to be a little, mmmm, RICHER if I want them for DINNER
<GOOD> Help
<GOOD> Am I really the only shitty YTP era survivor.... <a:hollowpain:661093056426016768>
<GOOD> Truly a lost art form
<GOOD> Why are they taped
<GOOD> And why are they 8
<GOOD> Can you not punch without the tape
<GOOD> Someone mixed my fixations and favourite characters againnnn
<GOOD> I can never handle it when it happens
<GOOD> EXACTLY
<GOOD> I need them tbh
<GOOD> If I weren't refusing to eat there I'd go
<GOOD> I need the Kuromi slifer
<GOOD> Apparently
<GOOD> My mom said that at least
<GOOD> Kuromi is the black and white skull cat creature, Slifer is a yugioh card
<GOOD> Egyptian god
<GOOD> I also want the blue eyes one
<GOOD> But that would require both going to McDonald's and ordering a happy meal for myself
<GOOD> That's not my issue
<GOOD> It's that it isn't worth it
<GOOD> Chocolate, brownie and oreo
<GOOD> And caramel fudge
<GOOD> And cookie dough
<GOOD> And rocky road
<GOOD> Chocolate
<GOOD> My favorite food is warm chocolate fudge cake and vanilla ice cream, or chocolate ice cream
<GOOD> I wanna try warm chocolate fudge cake topped with brownie ice cream ngl..
<GOOD> Chocolate can never NOT be good
<GOOD> Unless if it's fruit
<GOOD> Yucky :<
<GOOD> Not too much of a fan of mint chocolate either
<GOOD> Mint is yucky
<GOOD> FL I'm not lynching you but you will be set on fire and then tarred and feathered and then raked across the coals and then set on fire again and then keelhauled for this
<GOOD> Chocolate mousse is also amazing
<GOOD> You will only be dunked in water for this, as a warning
<GOOD> And I'll give you a stern look
<GOOD> Did you also need a stern look
<GOOD> I think my 2nd favourite food is millionaire's shortbread
<GOOD> Yummyyyyy
<GOOD> I want millionaire's shortbread and chocolate fudge cake and chocolate milk rn
<GOOD> Topped with chocolate brownie ice cream with crushed oreo on it
<GOOD> I should consider having coffee ice cream with my breakfast instead of just coffee tbh...
<GOOD> Yummyyyyy
<GOOD> No I'll have it WITH breakfast smh
<GOOD> Unless you have bread flavoured ice cream
<GOOD> I just have toast and coffee
<GOOD> And maybe like 2 digestives to dunk in the coffee
<GOOD> I have a sweet tooth
<GOOD> Although the bread I use is seeded loaf
<GOOD> Because it's yummy asf
<GOOD> What the hell are oats
<GOOD> Like weetabix?
<GOOD> Like how do you eat them do you just chew them
<GOOD> I knew what they are but like I didn't know they were just food you could eat with nothing else
<GOOD> Wouldn't you have a dry mouth
<GOOD> Might stick with toast
<GOOD> I heard seeds are yummy tho
<GOOD> Like just seeds in a bag
<GOOD> Are oats sweet
<GOOD> Does oaty mean sweet
<GOOD> Ooooh honey oats
<GOOD> Can I just buy weetabix and eat them raw
<GOOD> It's wheat and bix
<GOOD> I should just chew on these
<GOOD> Also I snack on bread slices
<GOOD> In fact it's almost midnight, may be time for midnight bread
<GOOD> Idk it's brown bread and a multiseed loaf
<GOOD> I know it tastes good
<GOOD> And I barely put butter on because too much butter is yucky
<GOOD> And it's unsalted anyway so
<GOOD> I can have white bread but seeded better
<GOOD> I always eat the end pieces without toasting them
<GOOD> I don't like toasted end pieces because I can't eat the middle and the crust separately
<GOOD> I usually have this
<GOOD> I should go to the morrisons bakery ngl
<GOOD> And try more breads
<GOOD> Like I haven't tried many breads
<GOOD> I don't know what that MEANS
<GOOD> I wanna try exotic breads first I've only eaten from the loaf
<GOOD> Also why is sliced bread like, the best thing ever
<GOOD> I don't understand
<GOOD> Why is sliced bread the best thing in the human epoch
<GOOD> I don't understand
<GOOD> Yeah like they'd get rid of the end pieces if it was so good
<GOOD> I should try healthier sweet things too
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I don't understand
<GOOD> I'm trying to research sliced bread why is it so good
<GOOD> It just says it led to people eating more bread
<GOOD> What is Big Bread hiding
<GOOD> I wanna try this other fruit I forgot the name
<GOOD> Persimmon?
<GOOD> I tried it as a kid and loved it but never tried it again
<GOOD> Idek if it was a persimmon
<GOOD> It was just very sweet and had a firmer texture than usual
<GOOD> Almost crunchy but not
<GOOD> Midnight bread....
<GOOD> Ngl I've never had a nut in my life
<GOOD> Midnight bread and ribena out the carton next to my drawing tablet
<GOOD> Now we're cooking with gas
<GOOD> I wanna try that third one
<GOOD> Oh it's sour
<GOOD> Is it tangy
<GOOD> Are you sure sourdough tastes good
<GOOD> Tangy isn't a nice taste
<GOOD> I don't want acid bread
<GOOD> ACID BREAD IS NOT PUPPIES
<GOOD> I need sweet bread that's healthy
<GOOD> How did they get the ham in
<GOOD> That sounds hard
<GOOD> Ribena is so yummy
<GOOD> I love ribena
<GOOD> Fellas give me a list of nice breads to buy at morrisons
<GOOD> Or should I just buy what looks yummy
<GOOD> I want crunchy bread
<GOOD> I wanna buy one and just eat it whole
<GOOD> Is that why sliced bread is so good
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I don't eat sandwiches ngl
<GOOD> I just eat bread
<GOOD> Or buttered toast
<GOOD> I drank like half the carton of Ribena
<GOOD> Uh.
<GOOD> That's what it says
<GOOD> It's a 1L carton
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> It's Ribena
<GOOD> It has some sweeteners
<GOOD> So I imagine part natural part sugary
<GOOD> What is casino bread
<GOOD> Is it just bread in a casino
<GOOD> Do you win it in a casino
<GOOD> I don't get the big deal is sliced bread good so I don't eat the entire fucking thing
<GOOD> It's so confusing
<GOOD> I feel like that dude from JJBA part 5 when I do this but it makes no sense
<GOOD> Why is sliced bread better
<GOOD> What makes it the BEST THING
<GOOD> And what was the best thing before sliced bread???
<GOOD> The wheel?
<GOOD> I want to try a tiger loaf
<GOOD> That's literally just extra filling street food
<GOOD> Can confirm that kinda stuff is rlly nice
<GOOD> Pork and stuffing sandwiches are nice
<GOOD> Not much of a gravy person unless it's light
<GOOD> Footie food
<GOOD> If you steal it they aren't gonna care
<GOOD> Want
<GOOD> Need
<GOOD> 2 QUID???
<GOOD> I've had worse
<GOOD> Nah, I'd win.
<GOOD> I've had so many dodgy chicken shops' chicken
<GOOD> My stomach is iron (usually)
<GOOD> Yuck
<GOOD> Also way too expensive
<GOOD> I think our scran that's just meat and a bun clears
<GOOD> Shredded pork <a:eat:395722001047748609>
<GOOD> Yorkies are usually full of mashed potatoes and gravy then eaten
<GOOD> Not a fan of peas
<GOOD> It's sausages and gravy in a yorkshire pudding
<GOOD> Never tried bubble and squeak
<GOOD> Not a fan of sausages tbh
<GOOD> I just like the meats
<GOOD> Oh also jacket potatoes are nice asf but I don't like cheese and I'm iffy about tuna and curry so I just have it with plain butter
<GOOD> Still very nice
<GOOD> Slop but I'd eat it
<GOOD> Maybe not the mozzarella sticks, I'm not a cheese person
<GOOD> I once went to pizza hut but I don't like cheese or pepperoni so I just ate croutons and almost a whole tray of pasta
<GOOD> Best day of my life fr
<GOOD> I also didn't know that croutons were meant to like, go with things
<GOOD> So I was just eating croutons
<GOOD> Shortbread is so nice
<GOOD> I want shortbread
<GOOD> Eggs, gammon, probably sausage and hash browns
<GOOD> And toast odc
<GOOD> Ofc
<GOOD> Everything except the black pudding and beans
<GOOD> And tomato
<GOOD> Full english is a standard after all
<GOOD> I don't like beans
<GOOD> What's suprising about me not liking baked beans
<GOOD> It's tomato sauce
<GOOD> I do not like tomatoes
<GOOD> I want a star fruit
<GOOD> I wanna eat one
<GOOD> Are durians nice
<GOOD> I wanna eat a bunch of new things but like
<GOOD> It makes me mad that cheese is so key
<GOOD> Like I don't like cheese man
<GOOD> I don't understand it the taste is so weirr
<GOOD> It has a weird taste
<GOOD> Yea but then I'd have to go through a bunch of cheese I hate and also buy it
<GOOD> I just don't get it
<GOOD> Like cheese feels ugh
<GOOD> It's so rich and tangy and yucky
<GOOD> And it seems like a lot of cheese is like this
<GOOD> Why would you waste perfectly good milk on cheese
<GOOD> Just drink the milk
<GOOD> It's yummy
<GOOD> I will drink the milk
<GOOD> Yeah because everyone is too busy eating cheese for some reason
<GOOD> Waiter! Waiter! More mold on my rotten milk pls!!!
<GOOD> Deserved
<GOOD> Cheese is just so rich it makes me feel ill
<GOOD> Like even just cheese flavour on things
<GOOD> I once went to a pizza making thing and made just a pizza base with no sauce or cheese and ate that
<GOOD> I'll use this
<GOOD> Also all cheese is cursed
<GOOD> It's like asking for room temperature water
<GOOD> The extra brain growth is just your brain being filled with curdled milk chunks
<GOOD> Meanwhile mine goes straight to the bones because milk is good
<GOOD> Cheese probably causes blood channel blockage
<GOOD> It curdles your blood and grows blue mold on your blackened, cheese eating soul
<GOOD> Your avarice in consuming will be consumed itself by the grotesque richness and sting of its taste, and your appetite will be quenched and then drowned in an ocean of your own creation.
<GOOD> Cheese is the root of ALL evil
<GOOD> Yeah it's rotten cow piss
<GOOD> They should call it uddering
<GOOD> I feel so bad for laughing but who the fuck sent me this
<GOOD> I saw this dog a few days ago lmfao
<GOOD> Pimpy x Bape
<GOOD> Giagi x Lavendar goes crazy
<GOOD> Wait does anyone have the Ted video
<GOOD> THERE'S SO MUCH major league bullies!!!
<GOOD> Please do
<GOOD> I wonder what x Redrum is at
<GOOD> He looks like a frog
<GOOD> I feel very bad for the creature
<GOOD> 14x grinch 8x Zeus
<GOOD> I played it yesterday at gaming society
<GOOD> I beat up people with Kazuya
<GOOD> Monti
<GOOD> I played Oneshot it was very good
<GOOD> I love Niko also they must be protected
<GOOD> Very rare occurrence for me to actually feel that way
<GOOD> Yes but someone had to tell me to restart it
<GOOD> ||restore the sun||
<GOOD> I almost had a panic attack so I had to
<GOOD> The choice stressed me out too much
<GOOD> I didn't wanna learn him
<GOOD> Idk what to learn thh
<GOOD> Tbh
<GOOD> Still playing him as my main
<GOOD> I wanna learn Steve for funny reasons but he's literally just impossible
<GOOD> The rabbit hole never ends
<GOOD> I may try game n watch fr
<GOOD> The spinning mewtwo png in mewtwo x elsa was my breaking point
<GOOD> I like the characters
<GOOD> Are they bad(
<GOOD> I honestly don't know how good or bad any character is lol except Sonic, Steve and Snake
<GOOD> And Ganondorf
<GOOD> I wanna learn Sephiroth but there isn't much to learn
<GOOD> Yea Sonic is annoying as shit
<GOOD> I hate him
<GOOD> Homing attack and that fucking F Smash
<GOOD> Pythra also makes me mad because I'm too bad at avoiding her giant ass sword in Pyra form
<GOOD> Korewa
<GOOD> Water 7 is the start of the peak streak of arcs
<GOOD> There's only 1 bad arc between then and ||the TS|| imo
<GOOD> And the rest are peak
<GOOD> I love Long Ring Long Land but I'm not gonna say it's as good as water 7 lmao
<GOOD> Are you watching it
<GOOD> Or reading
<GOOD> LRLL drags out in the anime because they added rounds that weren't there
<GOOD> The manga only has Foxy Boxing, Groggy Ball and the boat race
<GOOD> I would recommend if you ever get to post timeskip to at least try the manga
<GOOD> There's a point where the anime becomes unwatchable padding
<GOOD> Like genuinely 15 minutes of things that have already happened
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I think One Pace is at Dressrosa? Idk
<GOOD> Meeeeee
<GOOD> Except Zoro
<GOOD> ||Jinbe|| spoiler for you two is my favourite SH
<GOOD> You had to say you hate Chopper
<GOOD> Whopper is my GOAT
<GOOD> He becomes chibified but tbh he carries the fuck out of the crew
<GOOD> He has a ton of moments
<GOOD> Usopp has uh
<GOOD> Some moments
<GOOD> Still the GOAT
<GOOD> He has the biggest moment
<GOOD> Also yippee new chapter today
<GOOD> But break next week
<GOOD> The latest chapter has me on the edge of my seat for the first time in a few weeks so
<GOOD> That's fun
<GOOD> The recent chapters have been good tho
<GOOD> Very happy
<GOOD> Unfortunate
<GOOD> The egghead anime seems good so far
<GOOD> Good ass fight scenes
<GOOD> It's what Luffy would want
<GOOD> Trust
<GOOD> I need to rearrange my favourites grid soon to be more clear
<GOOD> Maybe a new format
<GOOD> Like a list
<GOOD> My favorite is in the centre and my next favourites are in the innermost square
<GOOD> I fucking love cooking
<GOOD> It also suffered from the part ending the way it did
<GOOD> ||Go Beyond is really boring||
<GOOD> Araki always does asspulls but this is probably his worse
<GOOD> *worst
<GOOD> Maybe tied with the arrow being written in hastily 1 arc before it's used in part 5
<GOOD> Then rejecting Diavolo and having GER beat him
<GOOD> Even though there was no reason for the arrow to be needed at all
<GOOD> Like, requiem was not even required to beat Diavolo
<GOOD> Just jump his ass!!
<GOOD> It also suggests that Polnareff is more deserving of the arrow than Diavolo which is funny
<GOOD> I'm just not a fan of those ones
<GOOD> 4 and 6 don't rlly have asspulls in their climaxes and 7's is acceptable
<GOOD> 3 is... fine?
<GOOD> The twist is weird but it's ok
<GOOD> 7 is my favourite followed by 4,6,5,2,8,1 and then 3 probably
<GOOD> Actually maybe change 8 and 3
<GOOD> 3 is just really boring sometimes
<GOOD> Like people remember Dio but then remember he doesn't do a thing till they get to him
<GOOD> And for every Hol Horse and Boingo there's a Wheel of Fortune
<GOOD> Or The Sun
<GOOD> The Sun has a funny ending but it did not need to take that long
<GOOD> Oh also it has the only episodes in all of jojo I skip
<GOOD> 2x Iggy opp
<GOOD> Strength and Set
<GOOD> I despise Set it's such a dogshit episode
<GOOD> Like at least Angelo's shit is like skip about 1 minute and then you get to the decent fight
<GOOD> Alessi is just bar
<GOOD> Bad
<GOOD> Was Set 2 episodes?
<GOOD> Or 1
<GOOD> Omfg
<GOOD> Also they put that fucker in HTTF lmao
<GOOD> And he has his own unique mechanic
<GOOD> Or at least I think that's the game he's in
<GOOD> But he has a de aging mechanic that changes the sprite of every character in the game
<GOOD> Including shit like turning Dio back into a head in a jar while that merchant guy holds him
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Also random shit like Mariah being de aged into the old lady that slaps Joseph for being in the women's bathroom
<GOOD> I think that's what happened at least I haven't watched part 3 in ages
<GOOD> Some of the transformations don't make sense
<GOOD> They're straight up different characters
<GOOD> This was rlly annoying for shit like Hail 2 U or whatever his name was
<GOOD> Like that could have been 1 episode
<GOOD> Maybe?
<GOOD> I don't remember some of the part 3 ones
<GOOD> And especially not users
<GOOD> I think I have a bias towards D'arby the gamer just because it was funny
<GOOD> The more time it eats up in the climax of the part the funnier it gets
<GOOD> The Vanilla Ice fight should have been interspersed with the other crusaders still playing some random fucking game
<GOOD> The only one I thought needed like 2 eps to get the jokes across were Hol Horse and Boingo and Baster
<GOOD> *Bastet
<GOOD> Stuff like The Lovers was just really slow
<GOOD> And a lot are forgettable
<GOOD> Tower of grey
<GOOD> Oh lord ebony devil is a thing lmao
<GOOD> I remember dark blue moon mostly but not any fight detauls
<GOOD> I only remember tower of grey because it has a stupid name when SuperFly is a grey tower
<GOOD> Oh and the shit where jotaro isn't accurate enough or whatever so kakyoin uses the emerald splash in a populated aeroplane
<GOOD> No one can deflect it
<GOOD> It's rlly funny how Kakyoin just gets relegated to guy that has a long range stand
<GOOD> 2 identical rocks
<GOOD> Isn't his stand billy jean
<GOOD> Or something
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Geb was good tho
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> N'Doul
<GOOD> It has Jotaro throwing a dog
<GOOD> 3X IGGY 2X N'DOUL OPP
<GOOD> Was Enya 1 ep or 2
<GOOD> I swear it was 2
<GOOD> We needed more Hol Horse
<GOOD> And Oingo Boingo
<GOOD> I remember Enya's fight the most because that's where he was meant to join the crusaders
<GOOD> But then for whatever reason they scrapped it and Hol Horse just ran away
<GOOD> I'm gonna sleep
<GOOD> Bye
<GOOD> Oh apparently this new sonic game has an awful discord server
<GOOD> THEY SAID ALL QUEER MENTIONS SHOULD BE IN OFF TOPIC AND MONITORED FOR RESPECTFULNESS?
<GOOD> This is funny asf
<GOOD> Yeah lmfao
<GOOD> Apparently people are being permabanned for that because it's provoking
<GOOD> I wanna draw
<GOOD> Queer segregation in the sonic rumble server
<GOOD> I can't draw women
<GOOD> I am rn
<GOOD> This design disparity so ass
<GOOD> I'm adding more she deserves better
<GOOD> Ok there
<GOOD> Cba to study arm guards rn because it's a doodle
<GOOD> I mean I only added 2 things
<GOOD> It's no more busy than the crow fella
<GOOD> I suppose she should also have shoulder guards
<GOOD> Eh not rlly
<GOOD> A small fries at McDonald's is absurdly small
<GOOD> 1 nugget is about the length of your thumb
<GOOD> Yeah because it's made for ppl that are like 6
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> 20 mcnugget share box and large fries tbhtbh
<GOOD> They aren't.
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Like 100
<GOOD> Oh 100 for me is like, just kinda hungry I think
<GOOD> Like I didn't eat breakfast that day
<GOOD> If I'm allowed breaks, maybe some water and I haven't eaten? Like 200
<GOOD> Maybe 175
<GOOD> Assuming it's those particular nuggets
<GOOD> Honestly yeah
<GOOD> They aren't filling
<GOOD> 15???
<GOOD> At McDonald's I've had 20 + large fries + a drink for dinner
<GOOD> I only have fast food every few months tho
<GOOD> Vegans
<GOOD> I bought some frozen pork meatballs as a treat
<GOOD> They are very nice
<GOOD> As compared to what
<GOOD> Other fries or other chips in general
<GOOD> All food?
<GOOD> Like B tier, it's not as good as skin on fries or anything
<GOOD> It just has a nice, empty but salty taste
<GOOD> Good as fast food fries I guess
<GOOD> F tier fries are the microwave ones that feel like I'm eating paper
<GOOD> And I haven't rlly had S tier fries since to my understanding america has those
<GOOD> Chips tho
<GOOD> I have to say S tier chips are the orange chips we have back home
<GOOD> Nah, I'd scran.
<GOOD> The thing is like, I'm so confident in how many Nuggets I can eat because they're so non dense
<GOOD> They feel like nothing to eat
<GOOD> Like 1 big bowl of stir fry and pork and I'm down for the count
<GOOD> But nuggets?
<GOOD> Nah
<GOOD> 50 is def where I'd start being like oh I'm starting to not be hungry
<GOOD> Or like less hungry
<GOOD> Idk I eat filling meals
<GOOD> So my body wants more
<GOOD> 2 slices of toast this morning and I have a brioche bun for my burger for dinner
<GOOD> Well more like a chicken sandwich
<GOOD> But whatever
<GOOD> I don't bulk, I don't even exercise off most of the fat
<GOOD> It just disappears
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> I've eaten half a chicken and some potatoes and veg for tea before
<GOOD> A few times actually
<GOOD> I just don't like picking it apart because I waste some when I can't get to it
<GOOD> Sliced, groundnut oil and cooked into wedges
<GOOD> Preferably also with a pinch of salt
<GOOD> Idk what herbs can be used on wedges tho
<GOOD> It's rlly good
<GOOD> It has a nutty aftertaste but it's savoury, bit unhealthy tho because you're cooking with oils
<GOOD> I don't use air fryers bc I don't have one
<GOOD> But if you can cover them in oil without it damaging the fryer then probably
<GOOD> I just don't know how the cooking time varies
<GOOD> I like them cooked to be crispy and a little darkened so they crunch
<GOOD> As long as it's mashed enough to be creamy and smooth then it's good
<GOOD> Not as much of a fan of lumpy mash but it's fine
<GOOD> And if u mix in a little butter it's rlly nice
<GOOD> Maybe a tiny bit of gravy but I'm not rlly a fan of things swimming in gravy
<GOOD> Seems like a good deal
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> Is that a bucket of fucking rice
<GOOD> I need that
<GOOD> I love rice
<GOOD> Rice
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Even better
<GOOD> I like cooking meats in gravy ngl
<GOOD> Like just shallow, even covering in gravy
<GOOD> Sleepy
<GOOD> Aame
<GOOD> I keep dousing my arms in cold water
<GOOD> Me when the same joke yet again
<GOOD> (It's really really funny this time trust it was definitely funny)
<GOOD> I wonder why footie scran looks bad
<GOOD> No idea how this could be the case
<GOOD> The assertion is that meat and vegetables are not readily used elsewhere???
<GOOD> Do what wrong
<GOOD> Like it's literally meat and vegetables, you don't need to add anything to that except like gravy <a:hollowpain:661093056426016768>
<GOOD> The dish is literally just the most basic you can make
<GOOD> Good chips
<GOOD> That gravy seems just ok
<GOOD> Might be because it's in a foam box tho
<GOOD> Erm... that's just meat... Peru has NO food
<GOOD> I'd eat that in a second
<GOOD> They usually sell chicken also
<GOOD> That seems like a poor business model
<GOOD> Actually hmm it's kinda expected
<GOOD> But like, most chippies have at least 1 other thing
<GOOD> What are they I haven't been to a welsh chippy yet
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Reminding myself that 2 games I played as a kid just randomly had FF characters
<GOOD> Naw Mario Hoops 3 on 3 and Sports Mix Wii
<GOOD> Cactuar ballin....
<GOOD> Behemoth
<GOOD> You beat him up with volleyballs
<GOOD> They also made the white mage very pretty
<GOOD> She floats
<GOOD> I love Toons
<GOOD> They're my fave archetype
<GOOD> Bridget is making me feel something adjacent to gender envy and I don't like it
<GOOD> Maybe she's just enby transition goals for me fr
<GOOD> Idk it's just her vibe
<GOOD> She's so carefree and I want her hair
<GOOD> Rec Room
<GOOD> It's also more racist
<GOOD> From what I've experienced at least
<GOOD> The most popular map on rec room last time I checked was  like gulf war RP or something
<GOOD> And it was just 14 year olds RPing being racist assholes
<GOOD> Idek what to play if I play roblox
<GOOD> The mimiiiic
<GOOD> Yaoium

<GOOD> Photonegative Mickey reference
<GOOD> Zamn I have lying alone in my room and eating a popsicle today
<GOOD> Well it's night but same plan
<GOOD> Yea same nkw
<GOOD> Always happens later in the day
<GOOD> Google en sunflower backrow
<GOOD> AuuuuuuaaaaAAAAAAAAUGH
<GOOD> I NEED SOMETHING TO DO
<GOOD> Drew one a few days ago
<GOOD> Well doodled
<GOOD> Why does my belly button hurt
<GOOD> So Slender the 8 pages
<GOOD> One HUH???
<GOOD> Find my pages.
<GOOD> Kinda upset
<GOOD> Your mom
<GOOD> Average NHS hospital...
<GOOD> Too many people in hospitals
<GOOD> Glad it's almost midnight bread time then
<GOOD> What do you even do with all lands
<GOOD> Like what if you don't topdeck 1 of the 2 monsters
<GOOD> *3
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Did you have loss irl
<GOOD> Is that why you were there so long
<GOOD> How many of the hours were spent being like  at a hospital bed
<GOOD> Were you allowed to drink any leftover blood
<GOOD> Is that a dio thing I just drink blood when I bleed because it's tasty
<GOOD> I thought everyone did is this another one of those things where people don't do it but I thought it was normal
<GOOD> Because like I just lick blood off myself usually
<GOOD> Huh
<GOOD> That's a pervert thing..?
<GOOD> Ohhh
<GOOD> I should go check
<GOOD> There isn't as much here
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Yea the uni is too well lit for me to get a pic
<GOOD> People trying to convince me It's meant to be horror or whatever
<GOOD> I feel like if it was a dream sequence you could do more direct horror lmao
<GOOD> It's MEANT to be fucked up if it was It's weak sauce as far as grossout horror goes
<GOOD> Thing is that like at the very least there was some salvaging it with that intent, but then she made a post with the 2 siblings holding each other that said cry about it and shit and like
<GOOD> Atp people are absolutely gonna dogpile you, it should be expected if you're trying to rub it in
<GOOD> Not saying she deserved the bullying but you could certainly see it coming
<GOOD> Yeah like, the Berserk scene where Guts lets that inkling of hatred in the form of the wolf take over him and consumes Casca is a horrific and disgusting scene to witness, but it is handled with that gravity
<GOOD> What game is this
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Someone told me to play a game called Library of Ruina
<GOOD> It has a jester
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Someone sent me this design and I melted
<GOOD> Oh it is??
<GOOD> I need jester....
<GOOD> It's upsetting but making fun of the culture and the breeders is somewhat constructive
<GOOD> I really hope they rot in jail tho
<GOOD> Yea that's why I said rot
<GOOD> As in like, put in a cell and left there until they die
<GOOD> Not rehabilitative jail
<GOOD> Just like, kills you by old age jail
<GOOD> I wanna try some rlly high quality desserts ngl
<GOOD> It always makes me feel bad to laugh at this image
<GOOD> The account is real but the videos are shitposts
<GOOD> Oh dear
<GOOD> This is the first video I saw on it
<GOOD> He has others on the channel
<GOOD> 2x Pimpy
<GOOD> This channel is basically just a video dump for twitter shitposts
<GOOD> I wanna buy spelunky but it isn't on sale
<GOOD> Sounds more like an N thing
<GOOD> His name is Saltydkdan
<GOOD> The actor is not called saltydkdan
<GOOD> Accidentally drew mildly icky body horror bc I was testing out a new brush
<GOOD> At least I also got to doodle Pomni
<GOOD> Freaky Dave
<GOOD> So much Kirby
<GOOD> I beat RTDL today and started 64 and tried Air Ride and beat the True Arena in Superstar Ultra
<GOOD> Galacta Knight kicked my ass
<GOOD> He was a bigger roadblock than Marx Soul
<GOOD> I never played SSU as a kid unfortunately
<GOOD> Grew up on RTDL, Epic Yarn and later Triple Deluxe
<GOOD> So Magolor was my impression of choice
<GOOD> I used an ability
<GOOD> Still took a bit tho
<GOOD> I don't know if I'll try without
<GOOD> Galacta Knight with no item sounds hellish
<GOOD> Also what is Galacta Knight's fucking problem lmao
<GOOD> He always seems so mad
<GOOD> Like Star Dream makes him and he immediately starts tweaking and smashes the computer
<GOOD> Or unseals him ig
<GOOD> What is a dark matter scout
<GOOD> Is that the dreamland 2 Dark Matter
<GOOD> Since I haven't played Dreamland 3 yet but to my understanding Zero makes a bunch of those
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> So that Dark Matter is just a goon
<GOOD> Also 64 feels really fucking weird
<GOOD> I am aware of Zero 2
<GOOD> Not much else tho
<GOOD> I've only done the first world of 64 but I'm missing so many shards
<GOOD> Ye I might play DL3 vanilla and then just use the NSO completed copy of the game to fight Zero
<GOOD> Since I've heard the 100% in that kinda ass
<GOOD> I also need to get like 4 more energy spheres in return to dreamland
<GOOD> Yea but I wanna fight Zero 2 :<
<GOOD> It feels weird to say I suck at Kirby but I really do
<GOOD> Like my ass is not beating any other True Arenas
<GOOD> *maybe* RTDL but that's it
<GOOD> Star Dream Soul OS is too much
<GOOD> I've only beaten 1 so far x_x
<GOOD> And I cheesed it
<GOOD> Hammer
<GOOD> I'm just afraid of Star Dream OS
<GOOD> Insanely long fight
<GOOD> I struggled on regular Star Dream lol
<GOOD> Also I'm buying forgotten land soon
<GOOD> Since I only just beat RTDL for the first time in like 12 years, I'm not buying DX
<GOOD> And I've heard FL is better than SA
<GOOD> With hammer I literally took 1 random hit up until galacta knight and 0 others
<GOOD> Like Masked Dedede is easy even without hammer
<GOOD> And then Galacta would have washed me without my hammer crutch
<GOOD> I just suck at kirby
<GOOD> Like Marx Soul was not as stressful as I was making it out to be
<GOOD> Except that one attack where he goes under you I still don't understand that one
<GOOD> I dodged it once and no other times
<GOOD> I didn't understand the timing
<GOOD> I guess
<GOOD> I'm probably not 100%ing any game that doesn't just require basic collectibles tho
<GOOD> Like my ass is not doing great cave offensive
<GOOD> I will buy Forgotten Land soon
<GOOD> Unfortunately means I don't get to play Marx :<
<GOOD> He always seems to catch me when I'm slowing down or turning
<GOOD> So I just blocked
<GOOD> I lost a Marx soul run and got so mad because I tried to block the energy sphere attack
<GOOD> It was my first time seeing it
<GOOD> I also need to play Squeak Squad or whatever
<GOOD> And Amazing Mirror
<GOOD> I think I'm good on doing them without abilitjes
<GOOD> I'll just pussy out and use hammer
<GOOD> I played Kirby's Adventure then played Nightmare in Dreamland immediately after  and realise they're the same fucking thing
<GOOD> Still enjoyed Nightmare in Dreamland tho
<GOOD> I wish Nightmare didn't look like that tho
<GOOD> He was cooler as a ball
<GOOD> I like balls
<GOOD> Those are the only 2 dreamlands I've played and I enjoyed them
<GOOD> DL2 was fun
<GOOD> I used a guide for the rainbow drops tho
<GOOD> I went in blind to both and I was suprised at how well they held up
<GOOD> Minus the archaic collectibles
<GOOD> Apparently they're not
<GOOD> I asked some ppl for advice going into DL3 and they were like please abuse the fuck out of save states
<GOOD> Ngl I missed the brainless whimsy of the ultra abilities
<GOOD> The music too like ugh
<GOOD> Yes I do want to get a giant hammer
<GOOD> I mean if we're comparing stupid funny abilities then it clears the Mega Mushroom
<GOOD> Since there's actual gameplay with this one
<GOOD> Do NOT play epic yarn it bored me even as a kid
<GOOD> Jk it's actually pretty good
<GOOD> I was just a bitch as a kid
<GOOD> I need to replay epic yarn through the 3DS port
<GOOD> Also I've been reading the wiki bc I can't afford star allies
<GOOD> And what the fuck happens in star allies lmao so much lore
<GOOD> So like is Marx canonically alive
<GOOD> Because he seems very much alive in SA
<GOOD> Is he Magolor Soul or did he just survive without absorbing Nova
<GOOD> *Marx soul
<GOOD> It would be strange if Marx were Magolor Soul
<GOOD> I also saw Morpho Knight
<GOOD> Me talking to Taranza, being unable to suppress jokes about his wife
<GOOD> Also I have played triple deluxe as a kid and it left not much impression on me
<GOOD> It wasn't bad tho I should replay
<GOOD> I think Sectonia's design just doesn't stick with me either
<GOOD> Even though she's very unique
<GOOD> Maybe I just like spherical enemies too much
<GOOD> I mean that seems to be what happens anyway
<GOOD> No fucking clue how Marx came around on Kirby tho
<GOOD> Ig he's just that likeable
<GOOD> I don't own the game
<GOOD> MARX WANTS TO DO THAT???
<GOOD> Bro I wanna make a what if for if Marx was assimilated by Star Dream soooo bad
<GOOD> I honestly don't know what Marx's deal was in the first place
<GOOD> Like he just wanted to be strong as hell and destroy shit afaik
<GOOD> You taken that back right now
<GOOD> Do NOT dunk on my baby
<GOOD> Does this suggest that between SSU and Star Allies Marx was just chilling somewhere
<GOOD> Like he definitely should have been around for Robobot
<GOOD> Maybe he was still comatose or smth
<GOOD> Somehow I doubt that
<GOOD> Afaik Nova isn't even sentient
<GOOD> Or at least wholly so
<GOOD> It doesn't seem to have its own agency in the way Star Dream got
<GOOD> What, grant wishes?
<GOOD> That seems pretty benign
<GOOD> Just imagined that shitty no don't hold the smoke in that doesn't do anything!!! Meme with galactic nova thanks for that
<GOOD> They look perpetually stoned
<GOOD> Bluntscraper
<GOOD> Yea but it doesn't do anything with em
<GOOD> Also the weapons are like, a clock
<GOOD> And a telescope
<GOOD> I wouldn't call a weather vane a weapon
<GOOD> I mean it can do whatever it wants but lasers can be used for self defense too
<GOOD> Maybe it's just a well armed chill space station
<GOOD> By accident tbh
<GOOD> Like the weapons are a product of misuse
<GOOD> Me when I send my weapon to war but the opposing side wishes for it to explode
<GOOD> Also wdym Galacta Knight was created by the ancients
<GOOD> Is Kirby not just a creation of natural positive energy concentrated
<GOOD> The same way Dark Matter is naturally formed from concentrated negative emotion
<GOOD> I thought he was just like, a strong guy
<GOOD> I thought Void just kinda existed, not created by ancients
<GOOD> I thought that was what Void Termina was
<GOOD> I mean isn't that because Kirby is an opposing force to Void inherently
<GOOD> Void is a concentration of negativity, therefore Kirby's positivity is the way to harm it
<GOOD> Which is why stuff like the love love stick can kill Dark Matters
<GOOD> I mean in that case Kirby's friendship hurts it because it's been poisoned by Hyness
<GOOD> Kinda fucked up looking baby
<GOOD> Although Giygas is also meant to allude to a fetus maybe so
<GOOD> >maybe
<GOOD> They made it up to anyone's interpretation
<GOOD> But you can't tell me there isn't a fetus in there
<GOOD> It's literally right there
<GOOD> You can't tell me babies aren't shaped like that
<GOOD> Like the nose and mouth are there
<GOOD> So like Where's the direct confirmation that the only correct interpretation is yours
<GOOD> Yea but your assertion is also not the intended effect as far as you know
<GOOD> They didn't outright say what it was
<GOOD> Because it's your opinion on it
<GOOD> If you didn't think it to be the right one you wouldn't have it as your interpretation
<GOOD> Retro...
<GOOD> Dreamland 3 is so fun so far wtf
<GOOD> Kirby game
<GOOD> I did mid
<GOOD> I still haven't played Wii because I don't have motion control access
<GOOD> I mean technically I played RE Biohazard(?) In Vr
<GOOD> But then I had a panic attack 5 minutes in and stopped
<GOOD> I just couldn't because it was too stressful
<GOOD> And the turning was 8 directional increments
<GOOD> Which I hated the idea of
<GOOD> Because I'd probably hear some shit and just
<GOOD> Max yiik
<GOOD> This doesn't make up for the exclusion of Fnaf
<GOOD> RE gamers don't know REAL scary games.....
<GOOD> Freddy fas bear
<GOOD> NOOOOOO
<GOOD> Doesn't even have Deltarune.......
<GOOD> Actually unironically where is Warioware
<GOOD> Warioware is peak
<GOOD> As a kid I had only played Jak and Daxter and I thought they were Ratchet and Clank
<GOOD> I had never seen what ratchet and clank looked like so I just assumed this was them
<GOOD> 2/5 worlds of Dreamland 3 beaten
<GOOD> I shall take a break
<GOOD> Ratchet and Clank trust
<GOOD> (I don't remember)
<GOOD> I played it on the PSP
<GOOD> I gotta say these character designs are atrocious
<GOOD> They look like Ice Age characters
<GOOD> Why does he have green eyebrows
<GOOD> Ok this one is funny as fuck
<GOOD> Any game with this type of cover is like ensuring you know exactly what era it released in
<GOOD> I love the mildly edgy mature covers for something that previously wasn't
<GOOD> Where they have this beige apocalypse tone
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Why the fuck is he built like that
<GOOD> Metal Gear....
<GOOD> 3
<GOOD> I also beat RR Raiden story and bought 5 but haven't played it yet
<GOOD> Playing Mario Kart today with my gaming society
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> What platform is peace walker on
<GOOD> PSP?
<GOOD> I'll probably emulate that and Twin Snakes
<GOOD> For now the Kirby binge is continuing
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Before that tho
<GOOD> I gotta 100% Dreamland 3, beat and 100% Crystal shards, start Amazing Mirror, replay Triple Deluxe, 100% both the main and extra mode of RTDL, then buy and play Forgotten Land
<GOOD> They wanna be Conker so bad
<GOOD> Oh also I'm getting a new 3DS XL in a month
<GOOD> Hopefully I can just move this CFW SD card to a new CFW 3DS XL
<GOOD> Like just take it out and put it in this one after doing system transfer
<GOOD> Ye idm that
<GOOD> As long as I can keep my injected shit and saves maybe
<GOOD> Sick
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> Lemme check I forgot lmao
<GOOD> Micro
<GOOD> Oh lmao
<GOOD> Maybe when I get the XL I'll try Robobot true arena
<GOOD> Got reminded of this image again
<GOOD> Does New 3DS XL need unscrewing or is that just for the plate on the back
<GOOD> That's fine thh
<GOOD> Tbh
<GOOD> I'm not gonna be taking it apart often
<GOOD> I do want a cool backplate for it tho
<GOOD> Wait can you replace the bottom back part too?
<GOOD> Ooooh
<GOOD> I'm gonna have to look for designs
<GOOD> Stinky shoe Sonic
<GOOD> Idk what patapon is
<GOOD> I don't understand but I like it
<GOOD> Do you have to memorise them
<GOOD> Because I'm ngl I'm shit at memorisation
<GOOD> He just like me
<GOOD> Mmmmmm I think this recent Kirby hyperfixation has become a problem
<GOOD> Or is going to become one
<GOOD> your time to shine
<GOOD> 3x Tauros 2x Kingler
<GOOD> I think it's the amount of inbreeding they've done
<GOOD> 14x Grinch
<GOOD> Also I was playing Smash with people and we actually fucking had a Raditz moment
<GOOD> Someone charged up robin neutral B while I grabbed Someone on high percent
<GOOD> I love shitty in-joke gifs
<GOOD> Also someone at my gaming society picked just meta knight and kirby and no one else ever, and was just like I think I'm comfortable with Kirby
<GOOD> This was after he said he was spicing it up and trying new mains (Kirby)
<GOOD> Yeah but don't worry he won't play most of the roster because he doesn't know who they are
<GOOD> He only knows the Mario and Kirby ones and has only played a Mario game out of the entire roster
<GOOD> He also only plays Nintendo consoles so I have to assume the only games he ever plays are Mario
<GOOD> I think he'd make a good nintendo youtuber
<GOOD> Yeah I heard he played Mario Strikers
<GOOD> He also keeps saying call me scott the woz but I'm not really an RPG guy when I try and talk about FF or something
<GOOD> Which is like fair enough if you aren't but I suspect you've never played an RPG
<GOOD> Can confirm as a previous not-rpg person
<GOOD> (My first one was Persona 5 and it poisoned my opinion)
<GOOD> He also calls most of the cast the anime characters (any human character that isn't Mario)
<GOOD> Oh also there was a Sephiroth vs Rosalina matchup and someone said I hope the hot one wins and I said I also have my bets on Sephiroth and he really defensively said I'm not gay
<GOOD> So that was funny
<GOOD> Idk she fucking sucks in smash so idc
<GOOD> She's so boribg
<GOOD> Also he says he only likes really badass characters like Dry Bones
<GOOD> And that's why he plays meta knight
<GOOD> Gotta get him on the Mario Party DS
<GOOD> Weezer
<GOOD> Breezer
<GOOD> I'm desperately attempting to talk to this guy about anything except the franchise he plays but it doesn't work x.x
<GOOD> It's a shame bc he's a decent person
<GOOD> And the last time I talked to him about anything else he seemed really shocked about dark lore in the nintendo games I like
<GOOD> Youtube video essay writers
<GOOD> You should have seen his reaction when I explained octo expansion to him
<GOOD> Child blender
<GOOD> And that time he had to reassure me he didn't think I was occult for liking the Robot Devil from Futurama
<GOOD> And that time he thought Guilty Gear players hated cishet people
<GOOD> He gave me a completely blank look when I said I picked up Strive fast because being trans gives you an edge
<GOOD> I would like to eventually introduce him to his second game franchise tho
<GOOD> He might like kirby idk
<GOOD> But he was also shocked when I said Kirby was made of Void and is kinda godlike
<GOOD> I didn't even hyperbolise it like some people do with the eldritch god crap I just said he was a kinda godly entity
<GOOD> And then I explained that Marx Soul is just dead Marx absorbing Galactic Nova and he was also shocked that dead people are in it so
<GOOD> Beat Dreamland 3
<GOOD> Fantastic game
<GOOD> I'm at 99% completion
<GOOD> Must do Boss Butch tomorrow
<GOOD> Basic Baldguy
<GOOD> Redrum's cycle of life and mortality has been INTERRUPTED  He will not be seeing the GATES of HEAVEN  due to the PERVSERSION of the NATURAL ORDER OF LIFE
<GOOD> Bully breeder: NO! What are you doing? You're supposed to obey me!!!
The 7x Redrum Souls:
<GOOD> I still haven't watched smiling friends
<GOOD> Except the  Gwimbly episoce
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> This clip is also funny but it's kinda giving Rick and Morty in some parts
<GOOD> Rick and Morty has a lot of loveable scrimblo humour where a throwaway character will just say some random bullshit while everyone talks over one another
<GOOD> I find the awkward talking over one another funny but Rick and Morty just kinda sucks
<GOOD> I'll def try smiling friends tho
<GOOD> just watch this fr
<GOOD> Buy what...?
<GOOD> I will soon be consumed by the rot
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I forgot I posted that
<GOOD> Yeah probably
<GOOD> My uni's gaming society just had a tier list night and I feel so bad
<GOOD> Nah basically they were tiering the best video games oat and also fnaf characters
<GOOD> I was the only one that played fnaf and is also fixated on it so I rambled for so long I had to cut myself off at 5 mins per character
<GOOD> And they said it was fine and they needed my input but do NOT give an autistic fnaf fan of nearly a decade the aux
<GOOD> I had also played like 5x more on the game list than they had and I was so guilty
<GOOD> Yea because I just kept talking
<GOOD> Yeah it's been going on a whole day now
<GOOD> They replaced the entire team twice in that span
<GOOD> Idk if the current one is transphobic
<GOOD> Apparently he gave gender to genderless pokemon and made male Kirlia evolve into Gallade only (and the same with Gardevoir)
<GOOD> And the same with Snorunt
<GOOD> Yea I just think they were being petty lol
<GOOD> This year is a good one for the trans pokemon community (we get to throw bricks at Verlis and get rid of yucky transphobes)
<GOOD> Apparently the new community manager was *also* transphobic which is like
<GOOD> Bro how do you fuck up again
<GOOD> I wonder if the current one is
<GOOD> They swapped them twice in 20 minutes
<GOOD> Yea and in their announcement they referred to it as an ideology
<GOOD> The second part is killing me
<GOOD> Ye sonic rumble was this week I think
<GOOD> Me vs the devs
<GOOD> This image is funny as shit man how do you even come up with this
<GOOD> It's so stuoid
<GOOD> Tru
<GOOD> I love aquariums
<GOOD> MONTERY BAY AQUARIUM IS MY DREAM
<GOOD> Or one of them
<GOOD> Wait what???
<GOOD> That's so cool what did they do
<GOOD> Adorable
<GOOD> Mmm more Kirby today I think
<GOOD> Ooooo
<GOOD> Very cool
<GOOD> Ah fuck my toast is burning a bit
<GOOD> It's only a little blackened
<GOOD> I add very little butter tbh
<GOOD> I don't like beans
<GOOD> Also I love seeded bread
<GOOD> I'm like a salary person rn
<GOOD> Don't talk to me till I've had my morning coffee guys
<GOOD> Hahaha workin hard or hardly workin Marcel
<GOOD> Woahoahoah looks like SOMEONE woke up on the wrong side of the bed
<GOOD> I wanna try more interesting coffee
<GOOD> I usually just have mocha tho
<GOOD> Coffee isn't an addiction
<GOOD> For me at least
<GOOD> Stock brokers
<GOOD> Don't talk to me till I've had my adderall laced coffee
<GOOD> Live laugh love
<GOOD> Radioactive coffee yum
<GOOD> Idk why but the coffee talk reminds me of a Bob's burgers ep where he like fantasises about having a rlly boring and lame office job where he laughs at Borat impressions every day
<GOOD> My wife
<GOOD> Incredible
<GOOD> My dad LOVES doing a Borat impression idk why
<GOOD> Was it just the best joke ever for 40 year old dudes
<GOOD> Mmmm mocha
<GOOD> Don't talk to me till I've had my VAPE
<GOOD> No shade to ppl who vape but those flavours smell like shit
<GOOD> 10????
<GOOD> Shameful display
<GOOD> You ahve brought dishonor upon us
<GOOD> We learn from the mistakes of our ancestors
<GOOD> Falin... save me Falin....
<GOOD> Falin save me...
<GOOD> I need to buy some wax
<GOOD> I've never waxed before tho so that's scary
<GOOD> I can't get someone else to
<GOOD> Ermmm but consider dysphoria
<GOOD> Is that not what you're meant to do
<GOOD> You just put it on, set it and rip it off
<GOOD> I tried the cream and it was shit
<GOOD> It came off in patches and made my dysphoria worse
<GOOD> So I had to use a razor and cut myself a few times
<GOOD> She's transition goals tbh....
<GOOD> She pretty
<GOOD> I gotta get rid of this hair I hate it sm
<GOOD> Still transition goals tbh ||I'd love to be a sick ass chimera....||
<GOOD> I'm just like Laius frfr
<GOOD> Izutsumi is like my 3rd favourite character now behind Laius and Senshi tbh
<GOOD> Marcille and Chilchuck are my least faves of the party but I still like them a lot
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It has a rlly strong cast
<GOOD> And the dub is good too
<GOOD> Also it's rlly fun how they deconstruct how dungeons and monsters actually work
<GOOD> It has good worldbuilding
<GOOD> Yea Laios is awesome (minor spoiler)
<GOOD> Ngl if I was in that world I'd be just as monster obsessed
<GOOD> Ye I relate to Laios so badly
<GOOD> I'm not diagnosed but I feel there's something there with the insane level of connection and relation I have w him + my general history lmfao
<GOOD> Like it broke my heart when ||Shuro told him he was trying to be polite by not telling him straight out that he's annoying|| bc I've felt that so badly
<GOOD> I can't take hints I have to be told things
<GOOD> The scene itself is very upsetting
<GOOD> Also I project my dysphoria onto Izutsumi a bit-
<GOOD> Spoilongs
<GOOD> Pls tell me when you finish I wanna talk about it so badly
<GOOD> Cat fellas are always sick characters tbh
<GOOD> I'm 3 eps into Frieren and it's already making me emotional af
<GOOD> It's just such a pretty manga
<GOOD> *anime
<GOOD> I've watched that
<GOOD> Was funny
<GOOD> Oh I'd absolutely be down
<GOOD> Would take forever tho
<GOOD> My last D&D character loved eating everything
<GOOD> They were a kobold
<GOOD> Ughhh I wanna draw or smth
<GOOD> But idk what to draw Marx doing
<GOOD> If I was gonna draw my comfort characters doing anything it would be them on the Weezer blue album cover
<GOOD> I should go thrifting tbh
<GOOD> I want a new wardrobe
<GOOD> My voice dropped for a second it's so over for me
<GOOD> Hell yeah
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Watching a fight over someone being cut off rn
<GOOD> I like spectating arguments
<GOOD> Sometimes
<GOOD> Oooo they're taking number plate pics
<GOOD> Oh apparently someone was doing 20mph in a 20mph road so the other dude is mad
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ok I really shouldn't have looked up scopophobia
<GOOD> O right that
<GOOD> DBD please.... add fnaf and I'll play it...
<GOOD> Why is wax so expensive
<GOOD> I'm not buying allat yet
<GOOD> Enough for my arms and legs
<GOOD> Waxing them
<GOOD> Wrong wax idk how to sculpt
<GOOD> I suck at anything that isn't drawing
<GOOD> Yea but like I'm right handed
<GOOD> How do I shave it with my left hand
<GOOD> Idk I just want all this gone
<GOOD> Need all of it off
<GOOD> Yeah I got my wheel set up and everything
<GOOD> I forgot wax sculpting is a thing ngl
<GOOD> I don't like cheese :<
<GOOD> Thinking about Christmas Carol again
<GOOD> Why did Charles Dickens right a decent story and then have the absolute worst and most stilted delivery of an important detail ever
<GOOD> Tiny Tim, who did NOT die like bro you could have had it a bit more subtle
<GOOD> Pizza also
<GOOD> In fact basically every aspect of a pizza is unappealing to me so I don't eat them
<GOOD> Need
<GOOD> I don't like Christmas carol much
<GOOD> An Inspector Calls was my favourite of the things we had to read for GCSE
<GOOD> We did Inspector Calls, Christmas Carol and Much Ado About Nothing
<GOOD> We also did Mice and Men and Taming of the Shrew the year before
<GOOD> The 2 Shakespeare plays we had were boring as shit ngl
<GOOD> I mean Mice and Men had a scene that was uncomfortable to do a live reading of too
<GOOD> Though then again the rest of it was also uncomfortable
<GOOD> Vaseline glove :((
<GOOD> Wait did I make that up I think it was a regular glove
<GOOD> Either way not a fun book
<GOOD> Oh we also did Noughts and Crosses I think, and uhhhhhhh Animal Farm a little?
<GOOD> I don't remember other than that tho
<GOOD> Our teacher just kinda let us read it and then told us what Marxism was
<GOOD> I forgot everything else but I made the connection pretty easy
<GOOD> Yeah we got taught it was about the problems with communism or whatever
<GOOD> And how a system of equality eventually trickles down to creating another authoritarian system
<GOOD> We had a teacher quit within a few weeks, I felt partially bad for her but she also said some awful shit to a kid that got her fired so
<GOOD> Coats indoors being banned is a stupid rule imo
<GOOD> It's very reductive and petty
<GOOD> Yeah because schools have a prison structure
<GOOD> Speaking of, the secondary school my brother is in (and previously mine) are at threat are getting shut down by ofsted lmao
<GOOD> And they've tried to quell it by introducing a point system where you can buy shit like cutting the lunch queue
<GOOD> And added shit like a slushy machine to keep funding
<GOOD> By squeezing kids for money
<GOOD> You can just tell they're desperate
<GOOD> Mine lost its association with the company(?) It was a part of
<GOOD> Because it was so shit
<GOOD> Like it was under a funded system of schools all under the same name but they lost that brand bc they were doing so crap
<GOOD> Yeah that's a thing sometimes
<GOOD> It's literally just to demean students
<GOOD> By being overly draconian in how they enforce rules they get a bit more leverage on students
<GOOD> But that also makes them miserable and pissed off
<GOOD> B-b-but growth mindset
<GOOD> They're off the hook trust
<GOOD> I never understood the branding no larger than a credit card on backpacks rule we had
<GOOD> Lmaoooo
<GOOD> I kinda understand it
<GOOD> In concept the system is effective bc you won't get bullied for wearing something poor as someone that grew up as like, upper lower class(?)
<GOOD> Like the only thing I ever got shit for was my trainers on PE days
<GOOD> Bc that's the only thing you could actually bring yourself
<GOOD> Regulated ones yes
<GOOD> We also had those?
<GOOD> Those aren't mutually exclusive things
<GOOD> Fym no shirt
<GOOD> The rugby style one was so itchy for me
<GOOD> Couldn't wear it bc it irritated my skin
<GOOD> Constant belittling, no pay, being taught boring shit
<GOOD> I retained like 2 and they aren't my best friend
<GOOD> I'm so tired of Britain vs America BS ngl
<GOOD> Like bro why does it fucking matter if I call fried chicken in a brioche bun a burger why does that matter
<GOOD> It's the argument that to be a burger it has to be ground up
<GOOD> And everyone that calls this a burger is wrong
<GOOD> But like does it really actually matter that much
<GOOD> I agree
<GOOD> It was a random stock image I took
<GOOD> I also saw someone say just chicken between bread isn't food I'd put cranberry sauce and lettuce on it like bro do you have to be extra, plain sandwiches are just a struggle meal
<GOOD> I fucking love going to a meetup to play games and a kirby one trick gimps me offstage and camps ledge over and over
<GOOD> I played Simon for a match and 2 stocked the other 4 players but yippee 3 hours of Kirby main
<GOOD> War never changes
<GOOD> Bc after you make 1 funny thing you have to try and wring it till it's no longer funny
<GOOD> Which in this case is anything after the first
<GOOD> Oh KH on Steam
<GOOD> Maybe it's finally gonna be my time
<GOOD> June 3
<GOOD> The trilogy
<GOOD> Or whatever these are
<GOOD> New keyblade also
<GOOD> It looks cool
<GOOD> Should clarify it's the 13th not the 3rd
<GOOD> I forgor
<GOOD> Oh idk
<GOOD> I can't wait for mods
<GOOD> Hopefully I can actually play it this time
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't know what most of this means can I just play them in the order I think they go in
<GOOD> That's a lot of things
<GOOD> Like why is there a .8 edition of a game
<GOOD> Oh I thought it would be 1 bundle tbh
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I have already questioned that one wayy too many times
<GOOD> Like isn't 358/2 just 179
<GOOD> I only got to the jungle in 1 and stopped last time
<GOOD> Why is it 2.8
<GOOD> They should have called it 2.75
<GOOD> Or 2 and 3/4
<GOOD> That's a lot
<GOOD> Goes hard tbh
<GOOD> I love the retro
<GOOD> If Christians are right wouldn't this dude be going to Hell for casting the first stone or wearing some shit they weren't supposed to when the bible was written
<GOOD> Either that or God's unending forgiveness just lets basically everyone in
<GOOD> Yeah it's all grift and bigots
<GOOD> What's wrong w buddy
<GOOD> I didn't know buddy was like a masculine thing
<GOOD> Tbh I get called dude more than anything else but I never associate that w being masc either despite it very much being so, so idk
<GOOD> I don't talk to old people
<GOOD> Yea probably
<GOOD> Hopefully they don't do it as much in future
<GOOD> Yea they is referring to customers in general
<GOOD> I don't pass but that's to be expected bc my voice training is ass, I'm bony af, passing as enby is impossible because ppl will always assume one way or the other and I haven't worked on how I look properly
<GOOD> But ig taking most ways to refer to me as gender neutral helps w that so idk
<GOOD> I'm already naturally bad at speaking and I'm not at the stage where I can talk in a trained voice without the windup yet
<GOOD> I get that before I even started voice training
<GOOD> So being more soft spoken is aaaa
<GOOD> OMG
<GOOD> They actually did stick to the JP script
<GOOD> Transphobia real raaaaa
<GOOD> I won't pass in a million years so lmao
<GOOD> My name is probably fine as is idk
<GOOD> Despite Tommy being decidedly masc
<GOOD> Yea but who gonna immediately see someone and be like oh that person must be enby, at best imma be misgendered the other way which is like, preferable I guess??
<GOOD> Ngl I don't even like the Snrub in my name
<GOOD> That requires me to completely pass as androgynous
<GOOD> And people would *still* guess one way or the other
<GOOD> I am very tired
<GOOD> I should just stop being enby teehee
<GOOD> Honestly atp just continuing to pile on apathy until idgaf anymore feels like the plan
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah but there is literally not another solution
<GOOD> I can physically never pass as what I wanna be and my ideal image is already light years away so
<GOOD> Being literally unable to reach what I want is kinda a demotivator ngl.....
<GOOD> I live in the UK which is already a bad start
<GOOD> Isn't this that game with the sick gameplay but hilariously bad dialogue
<GOOD> I wanna play it
<GOOD> So like
<GOOD> I randomly talked about waxing to my mom and she seems oddly receptive to me just booking somewhere
<GOOD> That's unexpected
<GOOD> Also kinda rough tho bc getting waxed by someone else feels embarrassing
<GOOD> Shut up Buzz, I'll kill you
<GOOD> BAD morning
<GOOD> I actually am glad it's raining rn
<GOOD> I'm frogmaxxed rn
<GOOD> Woke trans reporting for duty
<GOOD> I was playing Smash and the same person from last week said they were too mariopilled to pick any non cartoon humanoid in the cast bc they all look the same
<GOOD> I also juuuust managed to win against kirby a few times by using the GOAT
<GOOD> I mean DK is a donkey
<GOOD> This 97 year old Tgirl still makes Estrogen the old fashioned way
<GOOD> Actually how the fuck do you even get estrogen apart from the human body
<GOOD> Is it like a plant or smgh
<GOOD> When do I get to absorb JK Rowling and become Perfect Pronoun
<GOOD> I'll take her with me like 16
<GOOD> Actually nvm I think JK Rowling being anywhere near me would wither my soul and restore my gender
<GOOD> That hag doesn't have long left
<GOOD> I'll just wait
<GOOD> God imagine if that was still the case today
<GOOD> The TRANS CULT injects HORSE PISS directly into their brain
<GOOD> Idk where injections go
<GOOD> Joestar blood
<GOOD> Ouch
<GOOD> That hurts
<GOOD> I would definitely fuck it up
<GOOD> It's just like hacking your 3DS.....
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I guess I'd have to do that too :<
<GOOD> I almost throw up before breakfast
<GOOD> Can I eat them
<GOOD> Take a picture, might be police time
<GOOD> Is your red mark an abrasion or a blunt injury
<GOOD> Maybe try again if they bruise but for now first aid
<GOOD> I recommend an ice pack or smth just for now if that lump is from a punch or something
<GOOD> With blunt injuries it's much harder to dress
<GOOD> Are you cut(
<GOOD> Ok so for now try and use frozen veg to soothe it
<GOOD> There isn't much you can do with bruises and lumps except wait for them to go down
<GOOD> If you think you have any fractures or something then definitely ask your parents to go to the hospital, but I feel like you'd know if you did
<GOOD> Like you would be in absolute agony if it was the same type of lump fracture than I had on my foot
<GOOD> Unfortunately how abuse goes
<GOOD> My dad has yelled at me for going to the bathroom a good amount of times
<GOOD> I mean atp isn't that just neglect
<GOOD> Like they are standing by and condoning abuse/assault from someone who is over 18
<GOOD> These are all crimes
<GOOD> There's some leniency in charging for crimes when you're under 18 but throwing shit at people with the intent to injure them and then trying to stop them calling for help is a crime
<GOOD> It's assault and abuse
<GOOD> If it was a ceramic bowl and it was thrown at your head you could have died, it's not something to be taken lightly
<GOOD> I mean are they not also a threat to your brothers
<GOOD> I may have to let other secret basers field this one
<GOOD> I mean that's probably(?) Enough info but like idk
<GOOD> I have no experience handling abuse except my own which I just temporarily escaped from
<GOOD> Yis
<GOOD> Rejoice
<GOOD> Happy holidays to all who celebrate
<GOOD> I love goths can I talk to some goths by getting their number thanks guys
<GOOD> Ngl this is how most talks I've seen about it go
<GOOD> It's shared experience after all
<GOOD> And like I don't rlly have a solution so talking *about* it is probably the next best thing
<GOOD> Yea but this goes for Lumi too, unless she had a solution it's perfectly valid to share an experience
<GOOD> It only becomes a problem when people start doing trauma Olympics and I trust everyone here to not do that
<GOOD> Yea it took until like 3 months ago to accept I was being abused for most of my life because it wasn't as physical and the verbal wasn't as bad as what I've heard stories about
<GOOD> It's hard to share experiences without thinking mine are somehow less than someone who was hurt more despite us both being fucked up in different ways
<GOOD> I would not call this very well animated
<GOOD> This is me except instead it's the dinner soundbyte from CDi Zelda
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I think it was also the case in Iceland or smth
<GOOD> Yea I remember from when I was a kid
<GOOD> Mmmmmmm horse
<GOOD> EAT A HORSE????
<GOOD> I'm getting very tired of transphobia ngl I thought the dumbasses would have moved on from TTYD already
<GOOD> And some other dumb twitter discourse being like men will NEVER look good in skirts or fem shorts which is kinda annoying asf since I thought I might eventually would look good in em
<GOOD> I am aware but the massive swelling of erm men fucking suck and I want them dead all the time is mildly discouraging as someone that's masc presenting usually
<GOOD> Originally bait but then unironically consolidated by transphobes
<GOOD> Like, 2 of these at the same time and seeing so much pushback against people just existing is gonna kill me eventually
<GOOD> It rlly doesn't and won't end
<GOOD> Like I can understand not trusting men as a woman it's a dangerous world but the idea that I scare people and they want me dead for existing is just gut wrenching
<GOOD> Like they aren't gonna see an agender person they're gonna see a dude :/
<GOOD> And then bullshit like all men should be imprisoned by default and killed and then when people say what the hell are you talking about not all men do awful shit that's seen as a self report???
<GOOD> I'm so done with shit like this I just wanna exist and I'm getting flak from all sides like fuck off
<GOOD> Unfortunately a lot of people see me as 3 of those for being trans and masc presenting sometimes
<GOOD> Joycon
<GOOD> That's the only thing I remember him for tbh
<GOOD> I don't know why it's just such a bad animation
<GOOD> I wish I could punch him
<GOOD> Yea the racism in the joycon thing
<GOOD> I'm both when I optimise my build in Fallout New Vegas
<GOOD> Tbf I've only ever hurt bugs by accident
<GOOD> I literally would not hurt a fly
<GOOD> Actually ykw villain arc, I would hurt a fly
<GOOD> Have you not seen the animation
<GOOD> watch this for about 5 seconds to see the problem
<GOOD> Or watch all of it and try not to want to bludgeon the creator's self insert's face
<GOOD> Get the GC cover
<GOOD> Also cool
<GOOD> I'm not getting it yet but it's apparently good
<GOOD> Super Paper Mario would be peak
<GOOD> I like Super Paper Mario
<GOOD> At least what I played of it as a kid before the game broke
<GOOD> I should watch gravity falls
<GOOD> I know this block formation.... that's so retro of them
<GOOD> I can't look at this video without thinking of it being so retro
<GOOD> Like those 1-1 remakes in super mario maker
<GOOD> I enjoyed what I played but my disk froze late into that one mansion area
<GOOD> I wanted to emulate it but I think it requires a real wiimote and shit
<GOOD> Oh I already did that with Return to Dreamland
<GOOD> Do you really not need the pointer?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> TTYD remake is out and my depressive episode continues raaaa
<GOOD> I wish Birdo wasn't created as a joke
<GOOD> Yeah she's called Birdetta
<GOOD> That sounds like a cool idea
<GOOD> The archipelago
<GOOD> I'll think idk
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> I love anxiety hahaha
<GOOD> (I'm actually quite upset)
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I was getting rlly nervous on VCing because my voice training is going bad
<GOOD> I will probably also do that
<GOOD> I'm sorry for just leaving immediately I got rlly stressed
<GOOD> I would be interested
<GOOD> I beat Forgotten Land
<GOOD> Easy top 10 favourite games of all time
<GOOD> First credits
<GOOD> I just did the ultimate arena and I'm taking a break before isolated isles
<GOOD> Although I didn't expect it
<GOOD> I know it sounds cringe but I could see an open world with a Kirby that moves like this
<GOOD> I don't mind either
<GOOD> It's just something I could feasibly see working
<GOOD> It's very satisfying
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> I gotta finish the Isolated Isles
<GOOD> Haiii
<GOOD> Happy birthday but I'm sry :((
<GOOD> Everyone pings are rough
<GOOD> Oh oops
<GOOD> And true
<GOOD> Also scran rating?
<GOOD> Welsh fish n chips go hard tbh
<GOOD> I don't have peas
<GOOD> Probably bc it cost an exorbitant amount and isn't by the sea
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Same age as me
<GOOD> It was small enough that I kept it down
<GOOD> Tho tbf it is dinner and not tea so that's surprising
<GOOD> I also bought some dandelion and burdock sweets
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Also this baby crow is watching me
<GOOD> I eated it also it would dir
<GOOD> Die
<GOOD> Also I was looking for the train station back and some old dude sitting in front of his house said GOOD MORROW and then just gave me directions there without me asking him
<GOOD> I know his ass enjoyed how shocked I was
<GOOD> My train is once again 5 feet from the ocean
<GOOD> Also your bruise is bad Marcel make sure to dress it and picture it (I assume your parents brushed it off but other ppl won't)
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Partaking of the frog juicw
<GOOD> Frog powers were like my favourite quirk in that show
<GOOD> Gay Luigi
<GOOD> I like new Dedede
<GOOD> Me and Marx
<GOOD> What is this gif
<GOOD> That's awesome
<GOOD> I have so many of these
<GOOD> What did you think
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> Yea it was v popular
<GOOD> I love that one
<GOOD> Whimsi is faster so it's been seeing use
<GOOD> They're both top 12
<GOOD> It's not as omnipresent as it seems tho
<GOOD> Current regional usage
<GOOD> Boo
<GOOD> I mean it has the benefit of making Miraidon do more damage ig
<GOOD> Yummy
<GOOD> I will eat a horse
<GOOD> I am at peace and in charge of my own synergy
FUCK IT WE TERA EDRIFT FUCK IT WE TERA EDRIFT FUCK IT WE
<GOOD> I'd lose
<GOOD> Are you genuine
<GOOD> Oh then it's a manifestation of your soul
<GOOD> If it was good yes
<GOOD> Persona made me ill
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Kamoshida's palace put me in an irreversible coma
<GOOD> I still have no idea what the rest of the game is like bc they put Kamoshida first
<GOOD> Like why
<GOOD> He really wasn't for what I watched
<GOOD> I also heard they sexualise Anne even after the palace tho
<GOOD> Which kinda defeats most of the disgust I get from Kamoshida because if that carries over what's the point
<GOOD> They also just spend the whole of the first palace's windup with the flattest description of Kamoshida ever
<GOOD> Like yes he's an abuser and he is a creep I literally got that from the car scene
<GOOD> You do not need to then tell it to me like I'm 5 over 10 hours of dialogue
<GOOD> I mean tbh I didn't even care about beating him up at that point it didn't feel organic
<GOOD> It's like shooting a cutout of a cookie cutter criminal at a gun range
<GOOD> Like yeah probably a bad guy but why should I care he's just an evil guy
<GOOD> This feels heartless but like idc what they do unless I actually consider them a human being and not a character in a video game
<GOOD> I understand that abuse and shit is real it just doesn't feel organic being thrust into the game so immediately and constantly
<GOOD> Would it be too much to say the palace system feels like a flaw since the time to breathe and develop actual hatred for these characters isn't given
<GOOD> Unless this changes after palace 1
<GOOD> Idk about morgana since I didn't get to the constant sexual harassment part
<GOOD> Or whatever he does
<GOOD> Isn't she a minor tho
<GOOD> Also simping when someone doesn't want you to can easily slide into harassment
<GOOD> Ok man I'm glad I didn't keep playing
<GOOD> Also there's no universe in which that isn't sexual harassment like
<GOOD> Also the dialogue reminds me of when I watched some Neon White cutscenes
<GOOD> Which is funny
<GOOD> The bug snackerrrr
<GOOD> I already did dreamland 3
<GOOD> Either amazing mirror or squeak squad are the next ones I'm playing
<GOOD> I don't understand what's the gameplay
<GOOD> Morn
<GOOD> Reminding myself of a hacker OC I made as a child that I remember so vividly since he was my only one at the time and for like 10+ years
<GOOD> And I forgot about him and now wish to redesign him
<GOOD> Also I found the oldest art I made that I still have preserved (fake moshi monsters)
<GOOD> You can see where my mom wrote some of it
<GOOD> I'm losing it at my first documented artwork having Sexy Sexy Blast written on it
<GOOD> An artist ahead of their time
<GOOD> Oh also  I found this old image of one of those collections I got from magazines
<GOOD> As a kid at least
<GOOD> I have picked up a Touhou
<GOOD> I punched my desk and hurt myself while this fucking png was on the screen lmao
<GOOD> Frustration
<GOOD> Look at the progression
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Because it's not 100%
<GOOD> It means I lost
<GOOD> Like half an hour a run I think
<GOOD> If I get a good one
<GOOD> Because it hurts to play
<GOOD> And the game looks like this
<GOOD> For all of that time
<GOOD> I'm not fucking doing it I already know
<GOOD> Almost 40 bombs and I still lose
<GOOD> On normal
<GOOD> I'm shit
<GOOD> Well I don't see a beaten game
<GOOD> But I'm pissed
<GOOD> My emulator is fucking up on Squeak Squad
<GOOD> But it's peak so far what are you talking ab
<GOOD> What haven't I played that's better
<GOOD> Doesn't make it false
<GOOD> It's within their power to choose it too???
<GOOD> Like, it's writing because it's written right there
<GOOD> If Joker were straight it wouldn't be an option
<GOOD> Why is it non voluntary
<GOOD> You also have the option to not romance anyone
<GOOD> Yeah and that's weird as shit?
<GOOD> Claiming love for some other person your age is just as optional what's the point you're trying to make
<GOOD> You are an RPG character it's all optional
<GOOD> But it's not inaccurate to say this person would do that tho
<GOOD> Like whether it's a bad or good rep is irrelevant he is literally able to say I would marry a dude
<GOOD> If Joker wouldn't do it he wouldn't be able to say it
<GOOD> Ok but like that makes the assumption it is immediately
<GOOD> I don't know why you'd do that bc there isn't currently anything you know of that confirms it
<GOOD> I mean is it not possible for Joker to just be capable of every choice at once and still be the same person
<GOOD> Choosing to not romance characters in the game does not make him ace it just makes him not interested
<GOOD> Choosing to not answer that he'd marry a dude doesn't make him straight it means he chose someone else
<GOOD> Like dialogue options for Joker are just different things he's probably thinking of saying rather than this will entirely shape what kind of person Joker is
<GOOD> That it isn't a half existence to have the option to say you'd marry a guy and then choosing a girl instead
<GOOD> Like if a dialogue option said:
If I married someone, it would be:
Male character
Female character
It would be a choice to answer one way or the other but marrying a woman doesn't make you not bi
<GOOD> Yeah but Joker's choices reflect thoughts on what he wants to say
<GOOD> He doesn't change as a person by saying a different thing
<GOOD> He's more immutable than a lot of RPG protags that are just vessels
<GOOD> Yea you could
<GOOD> Although most RPG protags are just hollow minus a few traits (i.e Frisk)
<GOOD> Dialogue like this doesn't mean Joker would only respond in 1 way in this timeline or whatever it just means he's perfectly capable of saying all 3 but doesn't
<GOOD> The only times I'd say it doesn't count is fallout type protags because they can literally be anything
<GOOD> Based on choices in the game tho your character cannot be all of them at once
<GOOD> Like in Fo4 you can murder random civilians or be a pacifist or join a synth army
<GOOD> Some of these are directly contradictory
<GOOD> A character with agency can't be a horrible murderer that relishes in it but also be a complete diplomat that avoids violence
<GOOD> Then what are you specifically trying to assert
<GOOD> Yeah but it's not copium
<GOOD> The interpretation being Joker can say he wants to marry a dude in a spinoff?
<GOOD> It's not some cryptic roundabout thing It's just a thing he can say straight up
<GOOD> I have that shit running in my brain constantly when talking lmao
<GOOD> I mean yea because you make the conscious choice to decide them
<GOOD> Can you prove the thoughts are intrusive and not just things Joker might say
<GOOD> Nope all romance options
<GOOD> Afaik at least
<GOOD> Wdym pairing
<GOOD> I don't think so
<GOOD> Same but I didn't get far lmao
<GOOD> I like gijinka as long as they're cool designs
<GOOD> Shoutout to the vending machine isekai me and my friend watched
<GOOD> Too fanservicey but funny
<GOOD> Just in concept
<GOOD> I've seen it from both sides
<GOOD> This is the funniest nendoroid tbh
<GOOD> Every time I see this in my gallery it mocks me
<GOOD> I must beat it
<GOOD> Especially because the png is really funny
<GOOD> I hate hatred
<GOOD> Fire them out of a cannon
<GOOD> I'm not confrontational enough to tell ppl that
<GOOD> But I speak especially matter of factly and deadpan when I don't want to talk to them
<GOOD> Can't rlly help it tho
<GOOD> Someone I was playing mario party with at my gaming society was telling me how good he was at it while playing because he knows the strategies and I just kept dismissing him on instinct
<GOOD> Like he was rlly starting to annoy me
<GOOD> And the one time someone else tried to ask him to elaborate he was just like I'm not gonna say because then you'll know my strats
<GOOD> Like bro it's mario party fuck off
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I just chill and chat while playing it
<GOOD> Also he was backseating everyone's turn and when he got to mine he'd start talking and I'd just make the choices immediately and he was just like oh but you sho- oh, ok
<GOOD> I always do that on that game
<GOOD> Ngl I can't sit through a game of mario party usually
<GOOD> I tapped out of that particular one after 10 turns
<GOOD> Also does anyone here have advice for problematic friends of friends
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Dude wait that's happened to me w my dad
<GOOD> This past year I feel entirely different
<GOOD> I feel really bad tho because I don't think I'm masking around my mom and I think she thinks I don't want to talk to her when we call
<GOOD> When I talk to my dad I just feign smiling and laughing
<GOOD> But idk if my mom sees that
<GOOD> Well I lie to her about some things but I am genuine in how I speak to her usually
<GOOD> That happened to me yesterday afternoon
<GOOD> It only takes 1 random thought tbh
<GOOD> I watched a movie (Fall Guy was awesome) but then I was like why am I doing this alone?
<GOOD> Dop dop dop yes yes
<GOOD> Me warning all the Aussie mods of their impending Skibidilisation
<GOOD> Me but wanting to drsw
<GOOD> I wanna draw so bad rn because I finally remembered my first OC ever
<GOOD> Like, the one I had for almost 12 years atp
<GOOD> My memory of childhood is so bad idk why
<GOOD> It's all fragmented
<GOOD> Like I'll just straight up remember something extremely important by pure accident and nothing else
<GOOD> How were they made
<GOOD> Something I've been trying the past few days that seems to work is to start a 5 second count down and if I don't do it I'll be smited
<GOOD> No Skibidi mitosis
<GOOD> It's 10am
<GOOD> Also if it's ideas I just write them down in my phone notes
<GOOD> Night time is when I'm most mentally ill and also inexplicably more creative
<GOOD> I thought you had the motivation right now
<GOOD> I think today I will watch The Naked Gun
<GOOD> I like spoof movies
<GOOD> I wanna watch more action movies that are funny but also have good choreography
<GOOD> Me and my unfinished drawings
<GOOD> Especially this one
<GOOD> I got too mad at how shit it looked so I stopped
<GOOD> Yea I never draw across multiple days
<GOOD> fellas youtube content has finally peaked
<GOOD> Doug is getting more and more unhinged every video idea wise lmfao
<GOOD> Gadagadigadagada-oh
<GOOD> I should learn Minmin or Incineroar in Smash
<GOOD> Idk which
<GOOD> But Min Min is cute
<GOOD> And she punches good
<GOOD> Need a kiss from Vivian tbh.....
<GOOD> This mf was not spitting
<GOOD> Yes why
<GOOD> Also her hat and hair curl is so cute
<GOOD> You sticker stars
<GOOD> Jumpscared by her
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't think this is a trans thing
<GOOD> People just rlly like Vivian
<GOOD> Not denying it happens tho
<GOOD> Oh that's gore of my
<GOOD> How I feel with Touhou currently
<GOOD> Cool designs tho
<GOOD> She's so cool but why is she hitting the
<GOOD> I wanna draw in this type of style so badly
<GOOD> I just can't nail it
<GOOD> Or like, getting my own
<GOOD> Opening r/eggirl
<GOOD> I saw a friend of a friend say a slur they definitely can't say, post a Genshin Impact gif and then say Reddit is awesome unironically
<GOOD> I may have to ask my friend about it
<GOOD> Ooooo robot arm
<GOOD> Can I have one
<GOOD> Skibidi biden joe joe joe
<GOOD> I need to decide on a character to draw in this pose
<GOOD> It was already the most critically acclaimed one
<GOOD> Also does anyone have an idea for a hat that would go with this coat
<GOOD> I decided on a wide brimmed bucket hat
<GOOD> It was gonna be a beanie but it didn't fit the hairstyle
<GOOD> Made them look like a blond moistcritikal
<GOOD> The only zelda game I've beaten is link between worlds and like 80% of TotK's story
<GOOD> League skin.....
<GOOD> Are we thinking about the same stupid person
<GOOD> Mind reading woaahg....
<GOOD> Reeheehee
<GOOD> Hey I think I know that person
<GOOD> Fakemon gym?
<GOOD> Or someone else
<GOOD> Dam now there's 2 whole AI bros...
<GOOD> Why couldn't we have 4 halves of an AI bro.......
<GOOD> (I'm kidding)
<GOOD> I use this one bc it has a funnier aura to me
<GOOD> Gender returning to my body...... this can't be.....
<GOOD> I chose a good frame
<GOOD> Putting this on my fridge
<GOOD> I need this idk what for
<GOOD> It would probably be Miku
<GOOD> Wren is such a cool name I wish I had a cool name
<GOOD> I'm bad with names
<GOOD> Ehhhh Tommy is probably fiiiine
<GOOD> If I was called Bob or smth I'd change it tho
<GOOD> Plus names are hard
<GOOD> Why didn't I capitalise that
<GOOD> Argargarg dysphoria getting bad me boy I want a button that removes all my hair
<GOOD> Also just like a bad day today-
<GOOD> It just takes so long
<GOOD> And it's so itchy
<GOOD> With a non electric razor it takes even longer
<GOOD> Plus I'm afraid of shaving around my thighs
<GOOD> Because of blood vessels
<GOOD> Yea but assuming I do get cut there that one artery is dangerouuuuus
<GOOD> Like, if I cut it I die
<GOOD> I do that every 2 days but after like 1 day I already feel like shit because my face feels rough
<GOOD> Idk I'm just so tired of this
<GOOD> I gotta do arms, legs and other places every few days just to feel a little bit ok
<GOOD> It sucks
<GOOD> And I can barely even get out if bed to shower some days
<GOOD> It's like, I can't do this at all
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I've actually found a bit of a workaround to being too afraid to shower tho
<GOOD> Just gotta put a lot of distracting music on
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> My therapist thought there was nothing wrong because after 2 sessions I said I was feeling better
<GOOD> And then didn't respond at all to shit
<GOOD> It's not that easy
<GOOD> So happy I found this because I was hyperventilating and constantly stressed while showering before and now I'm only a bit stressed
<GOOD> Now I just jam out to fnaf and check the door every 30 seconds or so
<GOOD> I didn't leave bed today lol
<GOOD> Ig it's just a chill day then
<GOOD> I'm gonna try some gelato at a cafe tomorrow probably
<GOOD> But what's a panic pill
<GOOD> Sedative?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I would take them too often
<GOOD> I panic in the dark and the shower and in the kitchen when I'm alone (not attacks just fear)
<GOOD> In fact I'm stressed as we speak because it's dark
<GOOD> I just said I have been
<GOOD> It stops the imminent fear of death
<GOOD> Mostly
<GOOD> Music in general
<GOOD> Rhythm heaven especially but I sometimes get tired of it
<GOOD> Ughhhh I'm stressed rn too
<GOOD> I'm just afraid someone will be/is inside my house
<GOOD> Or will dive at me from literally anywhere right now or is already watching me
<GOOD> Despite it being unfeasible
<GOOD> I had a night light as a kid but I had to stop using it rip
<GOOD> I stared at the shadows too long and they started warping
<GOOD> And I got wayyyy too upset about that
<GOOD> But I should def get a night light yeah
<GOOD> Rn my best aid is a sleep mask
<GOOD> I mean maybe idk
<GOOD> It's more just some sort of paranoia I think
<GOOD> Like I am afraid of sensory deprivation when I'm alone it makes me incredibly stressed because I don't know if someone is right next to me
<GOOD> Even loud sounds like using a hand dryer in an empty washroom is too much
<GOOD> The 2 biggest triggers are washing my hair and using a hand dryer but it happens often
<GOOD> Staring at doorways/places I can't see also does it
<GOOD> Because I'm like haha yea what if someone or something just crashed through that doorway rn haha
<GOOD> Remembering that time once again my dad took like 8-10 year old me on a light gun arcade machine that got more violent and frightening the more stressed you are and then put me on the zombie level (my fear at the time)
<GOOD> And wouldn't let me leave
<GOOD> Sorry
<GOOD> I really should stop consuming horror media as much as I like it
<GOOD> I think it's feeding too directly into my fears
<GOOD> Wish I could un-consume the mandela catalogue
<GOOD> I watched it from overviews/other people because I'm a coward
<GOOD> Still too much for me especially since it directly feeds into a fear of intruders
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I need to watch spirited away
<GOOD> I've watched Porco
<GOOD> Man I don't need a night light imma just treat every night like a fnaf fangame
<GOOD> I have a torch lmao
<GOOD> Joy of Creation type shit
<GOOD> Dangerous?
<GOOD> I don't leave it on or anything I shine it when I'm almost certain I see someone in the corner
<GOOD> Playtime with Percy?
<GOOD> Oh wait nvm
<GOOD> I reread it
<GOOD> I just saw microgame, parody and fnaf
<GOOD> I pussy out of most fnaf fangames anyway lmao
<GOOD> A bite at Freddy's was good tho
<GOOD> He knows how to make his son feel really ashamed
<GOOD> They doxxed the backrooms
<GOOD> Fire is ireland nice
<GOOD> I might come across on a ferry at some point
<GOOD> 6 MONTHS???
<GOOD> DanTDM
<GOOD> Oh my fucking god
<GOOD> The man is an addict
<GOOD> They're cool
<GOOD> Ahhh
<GOOD> I wanna draw a Zonai OC
<GOOD> I need to make more inklings based on different animals
<GOOD> They're one of them yes
<GOOD> I also wanna draw a Kirby OC but I know I'd want to make it a Dark Matter
<GOOD> And Dark Matters are pretty much always just balls with eyes
<GOOD> If this can exist in Kirby most can
<GOOD> Kirby designs in general too
<GOOD> Like most enemies are not just balls
<GOOD> Sir Kibble isn't a ball tho
<GOOD> The boomerang guys
<GOOD> Yea but that's not just a ball in the same way Kirby is
<GOOD> But yea the Dark Matters are hard to make new ones
<GOOD> Cuz like half of the dark matters look like this
<GOOD> I don't know what a sergal is
<GOOD> Oh that girl
<GOOD> I love characters that are spheres tho
<GOOD> Like just balls
<GOOD> I love balls
<GOOD> Wait
<GOOD> Spheres
<GOOD> I love spheres
<GOOD> They're pretty sick but I don't like Electrode's 3D model
<GOOD> I wish it was a bit more imperfect
<GOOD> Blue spheres hater spotted
<GOOD> Zero is peak design and I'm not joking
<GOOD> Second strongest Dark Matter probably btw
<GOOD> I fucking love blue spheres
<GOOD> I haven't played 64 yet
<GOOD> I played the first world but it controls so badly
<GOOD> So now I'm playing Peak Squad
<GOOD> I just realised he has a bandage
<GOOD> On his head, and no I'm not
<GOOD> So many people
<GOOD> I already answered
<GOOD> GRAHAHHHHH
<GOOD> This one looks good tho wdym
<GOOD> Tall women.....
<GOOD> Guys I tried Five Nights at Funkin....
<GOOD> It's just like fortnite festival
<GOOD> Day 1 Gogeta main
<GOOD> I mean we're getting into the Mimic era of fnaf now
<GOOD> The next game will probably be set in the 70s if theories are right
<GOOD> First PS5 game.....
<GOOD> PS5 has no haters....
<GOOD> PS5 only has as many haters as it has games
<GOOD> Which is 0
<GOOD> I ate mango gelato
<GOOD> I should have had charcoal vanilla
<GOOD> It's a cleansing thing
<GOOD> Apparently tastes exactly the same
<GOOD> I am unmedicated
<GOOD> Although I probably should be
<GOOD> You're so right
<GOOD> Why *do* they call it oven when you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food
<GOOD> I mean she's cute
<GOOD> I haven't played yet tho
<GOOD> I'm probably buying RTDLDX first
<GOOD> I neeeed the RTDL remaster but is so expensive
<GOOD> I will save
<GOOD> Big
<GOOD> Guys.... I need help I don't have 20 pronouns and the deadline for my project is midnight
<GOOD> Add more combinations
<GOOD> I need them to have legs for a head
<GOOD> How India-coded.....
<GOOD> That reminds me of like, the tiny round baby vs the strong baby
<GOOD> I forgot their names
<GOOD> The little baby looks like this
<GOOD> Nobody gets me.....
<GOOD> I hope I'm not too late to set my feelings straight with him
<GOOD> I don't think Goku is capable of hating everything about a person
<GOOD> I can't find the fucking image I want
<GOOD> I need the tiny baby that looks like it has psychic powers
<GOOD> It reminds me of Fecto Forgo
<GOOD> Fecto Forgo
<GOOD> Specifically its larval form
<GOOD> Kirby enemy
<GOOD> Eternatus called the Great Fire of London
<GOOD> *caused
<GOOD> Yea it came down and was like bro you don't even wanna know what's gonna happen to London Bridge and flew away
<GOOD> Did you know Eternatus is based on the fact that brits have hands that are approximately 4x larger than the average person
<GOOD> I am going to kill you
<GOOD> Death by yaoi
<GOOD> Are you implicating that you'll live this and achieve Ultra Fujo
<GOOD> No new nessie pokemon :((
<GOOD> I wish we had more cryptid mons
<GOOD> We need a mothman
<GOOD> Or a Flatwoods Monster
<GOOD> I still wanna try one
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I've tortured myself before with food I'll do it again
<GOOD> I almost ordered charcoal ice cream today I'm a freak
<GOOD> (That's not actually that bad btw)
<GOOD> I was being hyperbolic it probably just tastes like vanilla
<GOOD> Yea but like
<GOOD> That doesn't sound
<GOOD> Right
<GOOD> Like isn't batter savoury
<GOOD> I always add sweet to sweet
<GOOD> That's how you make sweeter things
<GOOD> I'm kinda annoyed bc like
<GOOD> When I was ordering ice cream I ordered chocolate and she thought I said Blood Orange, and then she said they were out of blood orange but had Mango
<GOOD> So I had mango
<GOOD> Still yummy tho
<GOOD> I don't think they had a different orange
<GOOD> No it was a cafe
<GOOD> I loved reading the google reviews there
<GOOD> You can feel the anger
<GOOD> EVIL FUCKING SKELETON MY BELOVED
<GOOD> I think the lack of any capitalisation and punctuation makes this one
<GOOD> Like writing everything as one sentence with no punctuation is rlly funny to me
<GOOD> Last one but both of these ppl are being funny asf
<GOOD> Hyenas don't lay eggs
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I could do it if I locked in tbh
<GOOD> You just cut in a square and remove the baby right
<GOOD> And then put the square back
<GOOD> I was born C section I know how it works
<GOOD> I think that we should stop letting C sections happen in case the kids kill the king of Scotland
<GOOD> Raaaagh I hate the monarchy
<GOOD> Even him
<GOOD> It should be XL Bullies
<GOOD> Pimpy Son Opp 3x Bape 2x Elsa
<GOOD> It is unfortunately a breeder
<GOOD> I hate them sincerely
<GOOD> Not even a breeder they fucking cloned Redrum
<GOOD> I don't think anyone takes the idea seriously that knows of it, everyone knows it to be an absolutely subhuman practice
<GOOD> It's like making a shitpost about a battery farm that mocks it as a concept
<GOOD> Car?
<GOOD> Oh cat
<GOOD> Disgusting what some breeders will do
<GOOD> Ear clipping too
<GOOD> I will be crushing someone's skull if they mistreat an animal
<GOOD> I literally had a polite conversation with a seagull today I'm not fucking around with my empathy for animals
<GOOD> I actually only found out that cats should be kept almost exclusively indoors a few months ago which I feel awful for
<GOOD> I never owned any cats tho
<GOOD> Yea as a kid I was like how do ppl feel safe letting cats out what if they don't come back
<GOOD> And I am only being told recently that I was correct
<GOOD> I'm ngl bros I'm feeling worse and worse about this world
<GOOD> I can't live in it much longer
<GOOD> I just realised after like a year of going on the train that my tickets online actually have a seat number specified
<GOOD> I've just been getting on the train
<GOOD> Idk my dog's breed
<GOOD> Part staffy
<GOOD> So close
<GOOD> Fellas I'm in a gigantic CEX rn
<GOOD> What should I look for
<GOOD> They have a whole 2 giant shelves just for PS2
<GOOD> It has a second floor
<GOOD> Oh it's cordoned off lmao I don't think they have the stock to fill it
<GOOD> I'm on a Chester day trip
<GOOD> This place is huge
<GOOD> I mean idrk what I'm doing
<GOOD> I'm just walking
<GOOD> Fun tho
<GOOD> Copping the physical release ngl
<GOOD> Also bold move putting this on the PS4 and Switch
<GOOD> Probably lmfao
<GOOD> I'm getting very fancy fish n chips rn
<GOOD> Ok chat pls remind me which is the salt shaker
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I almost ordered Hake or haddock but Cod is too tempting
<GOOD> I'm jumbo josh bruh
<GOOD> I wonder if they made Nabnab not a completely unoptimised billion polygon raw sculpt
<GOOD> Huggy wuggy seek scawy blue, banban, or like uhhhh... banbalina
<GOOD> Zumbo zoss
<GOOD> MHA almost over so I can call it kinda mid
<GOOD> What flag is this
<GOOD> Idk I'm kinda bittergiggle coded
<GOOD> Those jumbo josh oldheads don't know what they're missing out on
<GOOD> Newban is honestly leaps and bounds above Oldban
<GOOD> I have seen people draw Banban OCs and say that they recognise it's shit but something attracts them to it
<GOOD> Although I'm gonna be fr Banban's artstyle also isn't good
<GOOD> Uhyeah was in the most recent part which I find funny
<GOOD> He doesn't
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> He says that it's better than it was (which is true)
<GOOD> Because that's funny as fuck
<GOOD> He didn't wanna pass up the opportunity to be on all the shitty content farms
<GOOD> Like ThinkNoodles
<GOOD> Fusion isn't as bad
<GOOD> Pretty bad but not as bad as ThinkNoodles
<GOOD> Banban was released a year and a half ago
<GOOD> I'm crying bruh
<GOOD> Bro is acting like he's being sent to hell or some shit
<GOOD> This is over being an absolute unapologetic tool and being kicked out of the Melee community btw
<GOOD> I don't think skibidi toilet has that
<GOOD> It has toilets
<GOOD> Let it go bruh
<GOOD> I'm tired of these oldheads still clinging onto Bird Up and the original cast
<GOOD> Let it go sis, they're gone
<GOOD> If the Euphoric Bros bring back the OG cast I honestly think they're hacks
<GOOD> Especially with the narrative being presented
<GOOD> The Bittergiggle arc mogs your kindergarten ass bird and simple story
<GOOD> I'm gonna say it, the Jumbo Josh elevator scene was overrated
<GOOD> And the Banbalina classroom is the worst thing to happen to Banfans
<GOOD> They had to fix their mistake
<GOOD> And the next chapter's thumbnail makes me worry for the series' future going forwards
<GOOD> Like are they gonna make some rehashed Banban???
<GOOD> They need to stop riding his wave
<GOOD> The era of Banban is over, Cityngeon is already a better setting than the kindergarten
<GOOD> Better than Banban's Kindergarten
<GOOD> YOU HAVE THE READING COMPREHENSION OF A WORM
<GOOD> It is LITERALLY called GARTEN of BANBAN
<GOOD> You are a fake fan
<GOOD> Are people even following Banban lore anymore??????
<GOOD> They always just take things at face value these days instead of being introspective about Banban
<GOOD> Like they always say oh Givanium is so bad they retconned it in and explaining the Banverse characters scientifically made it less scary when it was LITERALLY hinted at from the beginning
<GOOD> HIS NAME IS SIR DADA DOO
<GOOD> A gartner of Banban
<GOOD> Like in universe?
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> Also I saw like, a bucket of Catnap plushies
<GOOD> Today
<GOOD> Have you asked one
<GOOD> About Banban?
<GOOD> Yeah it's a nuanced series
<GOOD> A lot of kids won't get it
<GOOD> I have a confession to make
<GOOD> Yk how I love jesters
<GOOD> Like, all jesters p much
<GOOD> They get me very excited
<GOOD> Yes I actually like bittergiggle partially
<GOOD> My greatest shame
<GOOD> I have stockholm syndrome w Banban
<GOOD> Like I don't dislike Stinger Flynn, the new designs or Banban himself
<GOOD> Not even Jumbo Josh
<GOOD> I don't like sheriff toadster tho
<GOOD> Unironic btw
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> The idk ones I'm fairly sure are not
<GOOD> Are the green guys like, the givanium aliens?
<GOOD> Ok there
<GOOD> I'm almost certain these aren't real
<GOOD> Well yea but I already tiered those
<GOOD> Sonic.exe is still my GOAT ngl
<GOOD> FNF brought him back
<GOOD> Very happy about it
<GOOD> The bottom 3 seem to be unlikely to be
<GOOD> Idk what the chameleon is tho
<GOOD> I'm ngl, no
<GOOD> The OG Sonic.exe is just ok
<GOOD> He's gotten souped up since then with people like Lord X and stuff
<GOOD> I mean yeah no old creepypastas do
<GOOD> Except like, *maybe* russian sleep experiment
<GOOD> Smile Dog is ehhh
<GOOD> Because the base game has a song about someone wanting to peel your skin off
<GOOD> Also it's accessible and pretty easily moddable so
<GOOD> Yea and that guy wants to remove your skin
<GOOD> The Newgrounds tank guy also talks
<GOOD> A lot of the mods are voices
<GOOD> But ngl I don't mind the beeps
<GOOD> I never saw that
<GOOD> It was made on Newgrounds by Newgrounds users including multiple Newgrounds mascots like Pico and Tank Guy
<GOOD> Fuck Spooky Month song 2
<GOOD> I do not like that one
<GOOD> I thought that was obvious
<GOOD> They're like 3x people's heights
<GOOD> I've seen that I just meant beeps and borps ruining songs
<GOOD> Plus FNF has created some good exes I've learned about originally
<GOOD> *recently
<GOOD> Idk I was told about Scorched and I found him cool
<GOOD> I'm a personal fan of EYX
<GOOD> Oh and Furnace
<GOOD> But NOT STARVED
<GOOD> I HAVE TO MAKE THIS CLEAR STARVED IS NOT UNSETTLING HE'S JUST FUNNY ASF
<GOOD> I'm sorry he's just not scary
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> O I also like Faker
<GOOD> Fortnite
<GOOD> Would have been a perfect time for mad max crossover gbh
<GOOD> Instead of just theming
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> The big fists are awesome
<GOOD> Fortnite is awesome ngl
<GOOD> I used to hate it and then I was like wait Goku can shoot people and realised it was actually good
<GOOD> It's also just a really really fun game
<GOOD> Like the cars this season are hysterical I love them
<GOOD> And the fists and the movement
<GOOD> Plus you can do this bullshit
<GOOD> Which is always fun
<GOOD> Yea that's what Lethal Company is about
<GOOD> Also the capitalist hell is funny sooo
<GOOD> Why was that voice saying Akira
<GOOD> His name is Leon
<GOOD> You will not believe what just leaked
<GOOD> Jack Sparrow is coming tho that's close
<GOOD> Also I looked at your About Me
<GOOD> I think midnight is 0:00 everywhere
<GOOD> I should just put that in my bio without the tag
<GOOD> In my country midnight is at 12am
<GOOD> You delete it
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> Or just delete a character
<GOOD> <t:1712790000:t
<GOOD> The square hole
<GOOD> Fuck now I have that video in my head
<GOOD> IT'S MIDNIGHT AND I'M IN A DARK ROOM
<GOOD> I must retreat to sleep
<GOOD> They should make darkeners for guns like silencerw
<GOOD> Human.... I rememrbrrt yoottturrrre genrocidrss
<GOOD> Crash gif
<GOOD> Old
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> My hair fluffy today
<GOOD> I just don't touch bugs
<GOOD> Cute
<GOOD> I meant the otters
<GOOD> Ngl this predator eats animals!!! Is like yeah, cats are small creatures that are probably not used to being outside, nor are they made for the environment they're in when outside
<GOOD> Cats are just another animal so I don't like when people treat other animals badly for hunting them
<GOOD> Is the stereotype that coyotes eat babies real
<GOOD> Dingos are so adorable
<GOOD> Yea humans are animals too
<GOOD> Babies are just vulnerable animals if left near wild animals
<GOOD> Interesting
<GOOD> Are they actually an otter or is it just a way to describe it
<GOOD> Also this thing is adorable I have never looked at a dingo before
<GOOD> Ooooo
<GOOD> When someone says something so wildcaninephobic you have to hit them with the baby eater stare
<GOOD> Do dingos not also steal babies
<GOOD> Or is that a coyote only thing
<GOOD> Oh neat
<GOOD> The more you know
<GOOD> Oh mb
<GOOD> I mean like, that makes sense from a farmer standpoint but I guess that's the risk coyotes run by hunting
<GOOD> Random video analysis on fake conspiracies
<GOOD> I wish my recommended gave me more long form stuff about conspiracies
<GOOD> Hunting animals is so gross
<GOOD> I should have been more specific
<GOOD> About half of the examples of hunting animals is gross
<GOOD> Purposeless murder is yucky
<GOOD> Only when overdone it becomes a problem
<GOOD> Bro why can't I let twitter go
<GOOD> I opened a random post and one of the first things boosted was vile uncensored gore videos
<GOOD> I make a bingo sheet
<GOOD> That's how I organise most things
<GOOD> My friends watched me pick Lyra while they all picked the guy in HGSS lmao
<GOOD> Joke's on them I have a cool hat
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Hi chat I watched the Ape movie
<GOOD> My takeaway is that apes are bad and humans are awesome
<GOOD> Grrrr I hate apes
<GOOD> This movie showed me how apes are truly evil and how humans are correct
<GOOD> But you'll never make a monkey out of me
<GOOD> Would you believe me if I had that 2 minute clip playing in splices through the entire movie in my brain
<GOOD> Every fucking time
<GOOD> Dr Zaius was not present
<GOOD> Also this is the first ape movie I've ever watched
<GOOD> I think ape media is my favourite media to consume
<GOOD> I'm a bit of an ape fandom member
<GOOD> Oh right I watched this ape movie too
<GOOD> The exact same clips were in my head
<GOOD> May is apparently
<GOOD> Probably best to just practice good mental health in general
<GOOD> I don't have a mental health month or week
<GOOD> Enby erasure goes hard
<GOOD> /s
<GOOD> Guess I'll have to go it alone... heh, I'm a bit of a sigma that way....
<GOOD> I'm such a villain
<GOOD> What is risk of rain 2
<GOOD> Oh I like those if no one else takes it I will
<GOOD> Just give it a bit tho so someone else can ask for it if they want it more
<GOOD> I have a big enough backlog
<GOOD> So all roguelikes but this one is a TPS
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> Well not all
<GOOD> Isaac-type shit
<GOOD> >try to play FF7
>spend half an hour trying to get the mod manager to open ut
<GOOD> Still at it
<GOOD> I love whale sharks so much
<GOOD> I am hopefully seeing some seals today
<GOOD> One of my favourite animals
<GOOD> I sealed the deal
<GOOD> I wanna work in an aquarium so badly
<GOOD> Whale sharks and basking sharks are my fave sharks
<GOOD> Cute
<GOOD> I love almost all sea creatures
<GOOD> I don't remember one I particularly dislike
<GOOD> Although all marine biologists I know including me dunk on the ocean sunfish
<GOOD> Marine biologists are the greatest opp of the ocean sunfish
<GOOD> I mean yea I haven't seen one
<GOOD> They don't even know there are only 2 animals
<GOOD> I passed my big project raaaagh
<GOOD> I mean I've seen a lion
<GOOD> So it seems real enough to me
<GOOD> Do you have any photographs of dinosaurs?
<GOOD> I'm saying directly that dinosaurs aren't real
<GOOD> I believe in a corrected version of hollow earth theory where there are no dinosaurs in there
<GOOD> Instead there are trillions of moths
<GOOD> With that many moths yes
<GOOD> He's coming
<GOOD> Yeah but close enough
<GOOD> Morpho kinda gets Reborn often
<GOOD> Well in the 2 entries he's been in
<GOOD> That's a bird I think
<GOOD> No, in Forgotten Land it just becomes more confusing because he pulls the same shit, becomes canon and also breaks weird rules all at once
<GOOD> Like he just goes into a fucking mindspace and then absorbs Soul Forgo
<GOOD> Apparently it goes to climactic battles and then absorbs people
<GOOD> That's all we know of him from his figurine in Forgotten Land
<GOOD> I would call this breadcrumb (singular)
<GOOD> I mean we get basically none in Forgotten Land minus the possible origin of some Ancients
<GOOD> Pikmin 4 jumpscare
<GOOD> Fecto Elfilis sent them to Dreamland yes
<GOOD> Or Forgo I forgot what form it was in
<GOOD> Galacta knight is still so funny to me
<GOOD> He has 0 fucking chill
<GOOD> Like what's his deal
<GOOD> I don't understand why he was so mad the first time??
<GOOD> Like he's just mad every time he appears it's funny asf
<GOOD> One of my few S tier kirbies
<GOOD> Raaaagh subject to change when I finish Squeak Squad and 64
<GOOD> Just starts tweaking the second he exists
<GOOD> I honestly thought Galacta was meant to be dead before Nova revived him
<GOOD> The Galacta v MK one is canon I think
<GOOD> Or any of those ones
<GOOD> Or at the very least partially canon like Marx Soul
<GOOD> Like Marx Soul isn't technically canon but he did survive his death in SSU
<GOOD> Most side modes are like well if it did happen this would happen
<GOOD> And Star Allies is at least partially canon I think
<GOOD> At least at the basic level of these characters are not dead
<GOOD> I love Daroach so far he's epic
<GOOD> He's like I'm da giant rat dat makes all of da rules
<GOOD> I haven't played enough 64 to care about Adeleine
<GOOD> The game controls so bad
<GOOD> Star Allies Clean ability is so sick for bringing the friends back
<GOOD> Considering how annoying the shards seem and that I need them to fight the final boss I doubt it
<GOOD> But I probably will
<GOOD> What game
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I already know he exists
<GOOD> Isn't like, evil Kirby just Kirby
<GOOD> That's so funny bc you'd expect the opposite of Kirby to be Dark Matter
<GOOD> But he just isn't
<GOOD> I like the SqSq transformations that aren't Metal
<GOOD> Animal goes hard
<GOOD> Yes it's annoying as hell but I love the design
<GOOD> Squeak Squad: where did our treasure go????
Suspiciously 5 star bubble shaped tummy Kirby: urp... idk guys I couldn't pick it up
<GOOD> Bubble would work in any non-Squeak Squad game
<GOOD> In SqSq itself it's so ass
<GOOD> Yea and then you spend an eternity regurgitating it to make space for stuff you want
<GOOD> I like it a lot
<GOOD> Although it's where that stupid joke comes from
<GOOD> I hate the kirby get cake stolen and kills god!!! Joke because it literally happens twice in the whole series and one time it isn't god it's just dedede
<GOOD> And the second time it's Dark Nebula
<GOOD> At least I think it is
<GOOD> More of one than Nebula is probably
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> It literally happens 1 fucking time and people act like it happens all the time
<GOOD> Hell, it's a mischaracterisation for Kirby to immediately go after Dedede at all, since afaik by the time SqSq came around they were already chill
<GOOD> I don't think Kirby would ever be directly accusatory to Dedede without a reason
<GOOD> The only time they've properly fought is when Dedede deserves it because he actually did something bad
<GOOD> Or when Dedede is being controlled
<GOOD> Starving people is kinda bad I think
<GOOD> What if the bottom of the yellow bit opens up like a giant python mouth
<GOOD> He would because Bandana Dee has sauce
<GOOD> People saying he's just a waddle dee piss me off
<GOOD> Like Bandana Dee is basically Kirby's Luigi
<GOOD> Unless you count fuckin Yellow kirby or smth
<GOOD> He was also possessed in FL
<GOOD> Or at least influenced
<GOOD> Fecto Forgo had a chokehold on him we see it immediately drop once Kirby knocks sense into him
<GOOD> Then why does he kidnap Elfilin
<GOOD> That isn't something he'd do for no reason
<GOOD> But doesn't it make more sense that Fecto Forgo was telling him to
<GOOD> Especially since he's called Forgo Dedede
<GOOD> Forgo is an Epithet usually associated with the life form in some way
<GOOD> Yea that's why I said influenced
<GOOD> It still isn't his fault really
<GOOD> His mind is being tampered with
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I honestly think it was proximity to Fecto Forgo
<GOOD> Yea which is why Forgo has a hold on him
<GOOD> The waddle dees say he's thankful
<GOOD> And resting
<GOOD> That's about it tho
<GOOD> They say he's enjoying the town iirc
<GOOD> And then you get the blueprint
<GOOD> Mario 64 DS
<GOOD> I don't think Dedede can speak
<GOOD> At least in the games
<GOOD> SSU cutscene or smth?
<GOOD> Yea but like, Meta Knight's crew just can
<GOOD> Kirby cannot to our knowledge
<GOOD> The only time we've seen written words from Kirby is his thoughts
<GOOD> When he's like there can't be dark without light
<GOOD> Or something
<GOOD> What does he say
<GOOD> I don't think copy ability descriptions are Kirby's thoughts
<GOOD> I do not remember ngl but I guess since I was newer to Kirby I took Dedede speaking as a given
<GOOD> Since I didn't understand he didn't usually do that
<GOOD> I don't think Kirby would be able to understand that Chaos Elfilis is made of Morpho Knight and souls
<GOOD> OH RIGHT IT'S THIS
<GOOD> I mean he seems to have basic introspection ability
<GOOD> He seems genuinely suprised by most things that happen so I'm erring on the side of he's like a kind of stupid person
<GOOD> That fucking laser that I hate
<GOOD> DL2 dark matter is so annoying istg
<GOOD> Sick
<GOOD> I been waiting on this one
<GOOD> I'll look later
<GOOD> Drawing is so difficult
<GOOD> Getting pressed over this
<GOOD> Her name is Falin
<GOOD> They, and yes
<GOOD> Wait was this not a fan render
<GOOD> I thought they couldn't actually make something this sick
<GOOD> Not the first time, won't be the last
<GOOD> It was a joke
<GOOD> I don't play roblox
<GOOD> But I wanna try that fnaf 2 remake I saw
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It reminds me of scrap wyvern(?) from YGO
<GOOD> Love it
<GOOD> I can't look at Venom the same anymore
<GOOD> 6 mo-
<GOOD> Apparently
<GOOD> Idk whom
<GOOD> Discworld is awesome tho
<GOOD> Yuri
<GOOD> How was da fall
<GOOD> Miles Edgeworth Investigations
<GOOD> God trying to show other people stuff I like is hard
<GOOD> 5 is not cheap
<GOOD> My mom has fallen asleep watching dunmeshi
<GOOD> I can't get anyone on shit I like istg
<GOOD> Yea it's not anymofd
<GOOD> Guys did you know Luxray is the colour black
<GOOD> I hate Stan
<GOOD> Fuck Stan
<GOOD> Um... can we NOT talk about that right now?
<GOOD> I need to use this image more
<GOOD> Ngl between whoever tf this is and Roxy from Security Breach I'm starting to think I like wolf girls.................
<GOOD> Wait is this girl Beelzebub
<GOOD> There's no way right
<GOOD> THIS IS THE REPRESENTATION OF GLUTTONY?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Then um... can we NOT talk about what I just said?
<GOOD> It's the start of an era
<GOOD> I think @Pyrocynical would fucking despise analysing this avatar of gluttony frame by frame
<GOOD> TN: Beelzebub means Ba'al
<GOOD> I looked at a wiki and 2 of the 3 images of him are just him shitting
<GOOD> Like what's with that
<GOOD> Idk why but a completely implacable soundbyte of a gruff man saying IBS loudly played in my head just now
<GOOD> And I kinda like you less for causing it /j
<GOOD> Into the Pit video game soon
<GOOD> I can't believe fnaf finally showed child corpses let's fuckin go
<GOOD> Omg same
<GOOD> Also I have gone to bed and idk if my mom genuinely liked Dunmeshi or was humouring me because she felt bad that my dad was pressuring me to vote for the political party he likes 3 hours after getting back home
<GOOD> Like damn bruh I've been gone 6 months
<GOOD> Mammon means mom or smth I think
<GOOD> Evergreen...... come out Evergreen I need you
<GOOD> Hai all
<GOOD> My hair is messy
<GOOD> I wanna play SNK
<GOOD> Just for Terry
<GOOD> I'll eat them all
<GOOD> Wait wtf
<GOOD> That's sick
<GOOD> I need Sonic x Shadow
<GOOD> Look I saw Shadow gameplay and it looks so badass
<GOOD> Do we know if Sonic X Shadow is like, an intensive game to play yet
<GOOD> May have to start upgrading my PC.....
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> May have to cop when it comes out then
<GOOD> I love Shadow
<GOOD> (Has never played a game with Shadow in it that isn't also at the Olympics or Black Knight)
<GOOD> Or Gens ig but he shows up for like 5 seconds
<GOOD> Who is the green man
<GOOD> Is he capable and/or willing to hurt me
<GOOD> Do we even have the spec requirement yet bc I might wait a bit till closer to release
<GOOD> No moneys rn
<GOOD> Glad some things never change
<GOOD> The first image was just Shadow from Sonic X tho tbf
<GOOD> They really like trying to cover it up
<GOOD> Hmmmmm
<GOOD> I will ask when I have the moneys
<GOOD> I open twitter and people immediately saying SA1 aged better than SM64
<GOOD> Some people getting bold on this site
<GOOD> I like SA1 but would not go so far
<GOOD> Only by 2 years apparently
<GOOD> Not too uncomparable but honestly after playing SA1 for a while I think Mario still controls a lot more snappy
<GOOD> ~~Yea because Sunshine is ass~~
<GOOD> /j I actually like sunshine
<GOOD> The blue coins are just the worst thing in any game ever
<GOOD> I haven't played SA2 yet
<GOOD> Gotta do more SA1 campaigns
<GOOD> I also gotta emulate Shadow the Hedgehog
<GOOD> Yea but unfortunately that space race never ended
<GOOD> Which has led to the current state of modern releases by PlayStation lmao
<GOOD> No actually I think they should make the next Sonic game an unstylised, incredibly realistic cinematic walking sim
<GOOD> When sonic boosts you completely lose control as it zooms out to a wide panoramic shot of some giant monster and the game plays itself from there
<GOOD> They already did, they made the entire game
<GOOD> That game? Horizon Forbidden West
<GOOD> He's after me Skarm
<GOOD> If I don't he'll get me
<GOOD> I'll just skip both
<GOOD> How different even are the endings
<GOOD> Using monster hunter for art inspiration rn
<GOOD> At least the weapons
<GOOD> I HATE FACIAL HAIR OMFG
<GOOD> I don't shave for 3 days and I have awful wiry hairs all over my face I hate this I hate this
<GOOD> I'm buying an epilator when I go back to uni idc
<GOOD> It pulls hairs out at the roots
<GOOD> Idgaf
<GOOD> I would rather be set on fire than have all this hair
<GOOD> Idfk I wanna rip my skin ogg
<GOOD> Insanely expensive
<GOOD> 6 months
<GOOD> Expensive
<GOOD> Yippee continuing to be alive still even tho there's no reason
<GOOD> I love Laios
<GOOD> It's not rlly that I just don't have income
<GOOD> If we're talking how much money I have to live, it's 100 or so a week which is insanely generous but I need to stock it up in case
<GOOD> Probably too strong for fully evolved mons
<GOOD> Then it's not every pokemon
<GOOD> Powercreep also
<GOOD> It's fantastic in doubles
<GOOD> In doubles they definitely do
<GOOD> People don't run Technician Maus in VGC
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Bei
<GOOD> Bro
<GOOD> Shadow the Hedgehog is so cool
<GOOD> I can't stay away
<GOOD> No I just never really looked at Shadow
<GOOD> As a kid I loved him, as a teen I thought he was trying too hard and then as an adult I realise he does allat without trying
<GOOD> Tesco is unfamiliar waters for me
<GOOD> I always use Asda, Morrisons or Lidl/Aldi
<GOOD> Ngl
<GOOD> I could go for a big stick tn
<GOOD> Rn
<GOOD> Like I think a wizard stick could solve my problems
<GOOD> Just a stick
<GOOD> But it has to be an awesome stick
<GOOD> I also want the stick to have like a knot on the end
<GOOD> Like this
<GOOD> UTAH... OHHHHHH-
<GOOD> Galvanised square steel
<GOOD> Galvanised square steel and boards to transform 1m square space into a living space
<GOOD> Greatness takes time
<GOOD> Please please please
<GOOD> New creatura
<GOOD> It's already halfway over tho...
<GOOD> I'm not too optimistic rn because it feels a lot more like we made 2 Shadow things around the same time frame than a genuine campaign
<GOOD> Although I really hope they do more
<GOOD> Nothing is actually out, the movie releases in November tho
<GOOD> Forgot the release date for Sonic x Shadow
<GOOD> Is there more I'm missing
<GOOD> Some of these are very par for the course but I agree the symphony and the rider are cool
<GOOD> Also what does a campaign refer to in Rumble
<GOOD> Is it like a gacha game campaign
<GOOD> Also a costume in Superstars is hardly a celebratory thing that would have happened anyway
<GOOD> What, a model that takes like 1 dev hour to make? Probably
<GOOD> Year of Amy!!!!! Eat at Ihop
<GOOD> And a campaign in a mobile game
<GOOD> The bike is cool as shit tho
<GOOD> I will steal it
<GOOD> I don't like this page
<GOOD> I can't tell if it's trying to make neurotypical things ADHD or these posts are genuinely things ppl with ADHD experience (which are things I all do)
<GOOD> At least the ones that show up
<GOOD> It's scady
<GOOD> Scary
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> Is that thing when you watch smth like halfway through and absolutely adore it but can't bring yourself to do it again no matter what because some unknown force just stops you doing stuff you enjoy anything or
<GOOD> Or like when you have a massive interest in smth but then you're upset because you might stop liking it and you feel bad when you do other things in case your interests fade
<GOOD> But I need that for my 0.1 square metre room
<GOOD> I saw that in a CEX in Chester the other week
<GOOD> Weird lookin game
<GOOD> My mom showed me this plastic razor thing for tiny patches of hair
<GOOD> I gotta use em on my fingers at some point it worked amazing on my feet
<GOOD> I love the big fists
<GOOD> I wanna play KH but the jungle area in 1 + the gameplay up to that point being kinda boring killed me
<GOOD> YEAH BABY
<GOOD> I LOVE SONIC FORCES
<GOOD> Who is Sawyer
<GOOD> Just saw this posted again
<GOOD> It still goes on
<GOOD> L
<GOOD> Fortnite is awesome
<GOOD> They added a lightning guitar to it
<GOOD> Coolest shit possible
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Can't you literally play it for free tho
<GOOD> I don't rlly see an issue w the monetised stuff Fortnite does bc in the end you never have to spend anything
<GOOD> Then what does Fortnite cost
<GOOD> Also yes things are free
<GOOD> Oh my gotto, galvanizedono squara steeeeel
<GOOD> Weaponised??
<GOOD> Also amalgamations of unrelated media is awesoms
<GOOD> I mean like, it's not that egregious
<GOOD> Plus I can fish as Goku
<GOOD> WHAT THE FUCK
<GOOD> Isn't that Treasure Trove
<GOOD> 4D tbh
<GOOD> Damn it u were right
<GOOD> But all the new features makes this a must buy
<GOOD> Oh wait
<GOOD> They announced that AND a new game in 3D
<GOOD> And a Dig DLC
<GOOD> Go
<GOOD> It's on steam tho already
<GOOD> Shovel of Hope
<GOOD> Then Plague of Shadows, Spectre of Torment, and King of Cards
<GOOD> Then if you feel inclined, Dig which I still haven't played
<GOOD> Have been infected this movie has a realistic depiction of a panic attack
<GOOD> *informed
<GOOD> My hair has been wet so now it's all stringy and clumpy
<GOOD> My dad bullied me does that count
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Well because I wouldn't shut up about Metal Sonic
<GOOD> But I think that's p close
<GOOD> I asked my mom if the ribs I was given had bones in them in case I bit into them and hurt my teeth
<GOOD> It may have occurred to me I'm a fucking idiot
<GOOD> Oh also Frieren is peak
<GOOD> Me when I eat a gigantic fucking burger
<GOOD> Why do you wish to be a burger
<GOOD> HARD AGREE
<GOOD> I always explain everything I can in detail like, would that not make the alibi more believable
<GOOD> Ngl idk what my favourite fnaf game is still
<GOOD> I may have to do a marathon
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> I remember trying to do Plague Knight's in game achievements and gave up bc it was so frustrating
<GOOD> I can't control plague knight for the life of me
<GOOD> He's fun tho, and my favourite knight
<GOOD> I forget but does Plague of Shadows let you set Mona's gender
<GOOD> Without dying is evil
<GOOD> The rest are kinda ok
<GOOD> You can do relics and no money in 1 run, no?
<GOOD> I forgot about that
<GOOD> At least you can use the meal tickets
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> Plague of Shadows...........
<GOOD> Some are different
<GOOD> I'm crying at shield knight tho
<GOOD> His face is so funny
<GOOD> I think her stance also changes but idk
<GOOD> But ye I love fem plague knight
<GOOD> I can't wait for the customisation in DX
<GOOD> Plague Knight is always scrunkly
<GOOD> I mean even in Shovel of Hope he's just like reeheehee shovel knight, I'm gonna blow you the fuck up
<GOOD> He's a gremlin
<GOOD> Hehehehe
<GOOD> Scrunkle
<GOOD> Mornin
<GOOD> I don't get why my dad keeps complaining nobody cares about football
<GOOD> I don't think he even knows what I like, let alone anything about ut
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> Might be a girl
<GOOD> Or want to be fem at least
<GOOD> AI can't be better than anything
<GOOD> Thought we'd learned by now
<GOOD> It's ass
<GOOD> If it made a game it would just be a flash game you could already play
<GOOD> I'm getting into Strive tho.....
<GOOD> >pick up game for a session
>3 hours of Bedman labbing
>stop playing
<GOOD> I should learn Bridget she seems fun
<GOOD> Either that or Minmin smash
<GOOD> Bedman is a bed
<GOOD> I don't like dubious question marks
<GOOD> Yuyu Hakusho is awesome, I was randomly given a few volumes of it as a kid
<GOOD> And then I read HxH after and it was peak
<GOOD> I wanna play street fighter
<GOOD> This SMTV thing looks awesome
<GOOD> I want
<GOOD> I've never played SMTV but I've also never seen a bunch of cherry picked JRPG dialogue be funny so
<GOOD> CRTs seem awesome
<GOOD> Apparently sonic adventure on a CRT looks sick
<GOOD> Need this game
<GOOD> Urgently
<GOOD> I was not aware they had Mothman
<GOOD> I love this dude
<GOOD> I think he's called Jack Frost
<GOOD> MOTHMAAAAAN
<GOOD> Are there any other cryptids
<GOOD> YOOOOOO
<GOOD> Need this game
<GOOD> I saw Wend!go
<GOOD> And uhhh Chupacabra
<GOOD> Omg thunderbird is cool
<GOOD> Yes it is
<GOOD> Idk apparently closed culture and all so the ppl that believe in it don't like ppl saying it
<GOOD> Like this image is very obviously not meant to refer to the mythological thunderbird
<GOOD> Stuff lifted from it but not the actual thing
<GOOD> Random hoax image of the thunderbird
<GOOD> Basically the only one that represents it as a cryptid
<GOOD> Welcome to cryptids in general
<GOOD> Like yeah damn this is so real
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> I mean most cryptids have some root in either history or mythology where they're just like yeah what if that thing was still around
<GOOD> Like Nessie is literally just someone going hey what if a plesiosaur existed that would be mysterious
<GOOD> Fairly sure the tsuchinoko is a cryptid and a yokai
<GOOD> Unless it's just a mythological creature
<GOOD> Yea they tended to just, do that
<GOOD> When people catch wind of cryptids mass sightings occur
<GOOD> Which leads to activity and tourism and publicity and money bla bla bla
<GOOD> Mothman and Nessie being the primo examples but Bigfoot counts too and a bunch of others
<GOOD> I forget what that one is called that's like Nessie but I forget
<GOOD> Ogopogo that's it
<GOOD> Seems to have been picked up in cryptid circles as a hoax image
<GOOD> Cool birb tho
<GOOD> The new smiling friends ep was awesome
<GOOD> New jester character I'm inexplicably gravitating towards.....
<GOOD> So peak
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> And it's implied ||the eyeball twins are somewhat related to Spamtopians based on how Pim can speak to both of em||
<GOOD> Ah I don't have the file unfortunately
<GOOD> Well that seems like a normal enough fake lea-
<GOOD> OH MY GOODNESS
<GOOD> That fuckin bird
<GOOD> (The most reputable leaker in general rn)
<GOOD> Please please feature this
<GOOD> I need a push to start day drinking /j
<GOOD> Might play old Street Fighters
<GOOD> Why can't I play KoF
<GOOD> It has Terry
<GOOD> I should play Mugen
<GOOD> I also gotta play more Strive
<GOOD> The funny....
<GOOD> I heard it's sick
<GOOD> I have my card
<GOOD> One Piece
<GOOD> Pretty sick direct ngl
<GOOD> For the last few months of the Switch's life it's sick
<GOOD> ~~You give a shit about pokemon?~~
<GOOD> Neither of them are near New Snap
<GOOD> Would you call any of the games poorly ported
<GOOD> Nse
<GOOD> *naw
<GOOD> I was playing both sides
<GOOD> No Pik 4 DLC
<GOOD> It will probably have Bowser but controlled by smth
<GOOD> I wanna play but I'm gonna get slapped by coinbox(?) Sweats w infinites
<GOOD> Augh I'm enjoying smth with my mom but it has triggering scenes x.x
<GOOD> I'm bad at covering up that they bother me
<GOOD> This is a netflix series
<GOOD> Just has a lot of very vocal domestic stuff that really sets me off x.x
<GOOD> I hide it from my *parents* because my mom worries too much about me and my dad just can't know a thing about me
<GOOD> It's cool at least
<GOOD> I love seeing puppets and stuff
<GOOD> I think it's called Eric
<GOOD> It's actually about a kidnapping I think
<GOOD> But the backdrop is the main character is a puppeteer it seems
<GOOD> Idk I'm on the first ep
<GOOD> I mean I don't know if it'll be important
<GOOD> I do like how the stress of his show seems to translate to his home life rn tho
<GOOD> But yk, I don't do well on DV scenes it's like the only thing that triggers me
<GOOD> It's mostly vocal escalation and stuff
<GOOD> It's odd how other stuff doesn't affect me as bad but this does
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Hehehe
<GOOD> Manatees are only a tad detached from seals (my favourite)
<GOOD> YEAAAAA
<GOOD> I LOVE RAYS
<GOOD> I wanna try SF
<GOOD> Either Akuma or Urien
<GOOD> I love whale sharks also
<GOOD> I wanna play more than strive bc of long ass combos in Strice
<GOOD> I think I'm more suited to games more focused around neutral w more lenience on both sides fucking up
<GOOD> And apparently 3rd strike can sometimes be like that
<GOOD> Yea SF is looking fun
<GOOD> Especially w characters like Urien they look p simple but good
<GOOD> Also yk
<GOOD> The video
<GOOD> Ik this is a combo but apparently this isn't typical for SF
<GOOD> Or at least for them to go on that long
<GOOD> I just like him because shoulder and orb
<GOOD> He just *looks* satisfying even in regular gameplay
<GOOD> I don't know what other SFs exist
<GOOD> Wait what
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Does KoF have that sort of neutral play
<GOOD> Or does it play differently
<GOOD> By 3v3 is it like, switch only or can you do assists to extend combos
<GOOD> Ah ok
<GOOD> Godddd I'm hyped
<GOOD> Woah they should actually add that
<GOOD> The game would go viral
<GOOD> Who up attackin they bros
<GOOD> Can't wait for the Wega mod for Mario and Luigi
<GOOD> I wanna burn my hair off
<GOOD> And peel off my skin and replace it with better skin
<GOOD> The eshop is draining my wallet later this year
<GOOD> So rn I am deliberating between Metroid Prime and Metroid Dread while they on sale
<GOOD> Shadow x Sonic and uhhhhh
<GOOD> Mario and Luigi
<GOOD> I need to beat BIS and PIT
<GOOD> I bought Metroid Prime
<GOOD> Appletun is yummy
<GOOD> Do you not love playing Go?
<GOOD> Kills you
<GOOD> I thought you meant like, the move Barrier for a second and I was like but Mewtwo runs reflect
<GOOD> Or like, light screen
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> Gen 2 Snorlax uses a lot of things to make people miserable
<GOOD> I love Kuromi but hate Funko
<GOOD> I should start collecting Sanrio merch actually
<GOOD> Well mostly Kuromi and a few others
<GOOD> Like Tuxedo Sam
<GOOD> And Pochacho and Cinnamaroll
<GOOD> I literally bought Metroid Prime remaster yesterday
<GOOD> So yes
<GOOD> It's almost my birthday I'm allowed to stare at trinkets in longing
<GOOD> I was curious what this meant but I think these pfps would make me look like a person that drinks Monster that matches their fit
<GOOD> I still need to do that
<GOOD> I have Meltan and Melmetal at least
<GOOD> In like 50 years shiny Melmetal will be lost media and I'll cash out for a billion dolars
<GOOD> Dynamax mons aren't affected by weight moves
<GOOD> You can't use them
<GOOD> I mean dmax mons theoretically shouldn't be any heavier anyway
<GOOD> It's just an energy projection like the avatar
<GOOD> I love Gholdengo personally
<GOOD> Voting for the first time is scary
<GOOD> I mean the UK is pretty dire rn
<GOOD> Could be pretty important
<GOOD> Addicted to Chiitan, Japan's crazy mascot rn
<GOOD> Perhaps
<GOOD> Why sad
<GOOD> But that's Twitter lol
<GOOD> Chiitan isn't causing it she's just taking up ad space
<GOOD> AFAIK the only thing she's actually advertising is either Japan itself or just her
<GOOD> Either way she's adorable
<GOOD> Formerly?
<GOOD> That's incredibly funny
<GOOD> Like I'm ngl this just makes me like Chiitan more
<GOOD> Because like where is it getting the money
<GOOD> Is it being privately funded
<GOOD> I've heard mixed things about the difficulty
<GOOD> Still not sure if imma buy it but maybe
<GOOD> They should have said portside like a boat
<GOOD> Also decided I'm not buying it for a while
<GOOD> Seems like it's ER lategame cranked up too high so I'll give it a bit
<GOOD> Wasn't a fan of the billion-attack chains w minimal punish + reading flask drinking
<GOOD> And I imagine SoTE will be that but more
<GOOD> I was gonna use the Radagon sword
<GOOD> Was also gonna do a Guts sword one but like
<GOOD> That's boooorin
<GOOD> Everyone doing that
<GOOD> How's the damage on the enemies/bosses
<GOOD> Also I'm more worried about slower weapons being much much harder to use than dex
<GOOD> That remains to be seen for boases
<GOOD> Bosses
<GOOD> Cuz like I don't wanna just jump + heavy through stuff, I never been about that
<GOOD> Mh, I've been hearing a lot of conflicting things
<GOOD> Like I've heard a bunch of enemies and bosses have ||arena crossing leaps and hit for shitloads||
<GOOD> And ||can retreat after flowchart attacks like Malenia||
<GOOD> Still mad about that one time Malenia did her dashback + quick sword swipe about 6 times in a row to me
<GOOD> Cool idea at least
<GOOD> But if it's more of the same then I'll probably leave it because ER's lategame was bordering on pretty unfair and if it goes further then
<GOOD> At least Waves of Gold is still awesome raaaa
<GOOD> Good bc I got rid of my magic build in base game since everything seemed weak to bleed
<GOOD> I didn't build bleed tho just used the Radahn swords
<GOOD> But yea I wish I was more excited than I am
<GOOD> Another week without dunmeshi
<GOOD> (It's been 1 week)
<GOOD> I can't stop making jokes about the PS5 not having games :<
<GOOD> The jokes write themselves
<GOOD> Alr after looking through literally any online discussion about SoTE I remember why I fucking hate the Souls fandom
<GOOD> I shouldn't have done that
<GOOD> I need SMT
<GOOD> Hey just like my dad
<GOOD> I had to listen to him talk about politics and trans people and how young people know nothing for half an hour today
<GOOD> And then he said something that is like, factually completely false
<GOOD> Not even like a horribly bigoted thing the thing he said just wasn't true lmfao
<GOOD> Many such cases
<GOOD> Worms is peak
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I'm trans people, bow to your ruler
<GOOD> Why does studio ghibli food look so good
<GOOD> I might buy DQ11
<GOOD> Then save for SMTV:V
<GOOD> may have to finally buy one
<GOOD> DEAR LORD
<GOOD> Wait nvm it's not real
<GOOD> Dying
<GOOD> Felt
<GOOD> I love car mario party!!!! /s
<GOOD> I wanna try ||the kickboxing wrap things||
<GOOD> But yk no DLC so
<GOOD> Wait can you ||put the punching one in your right and the kicking one in your left?||
<GOOD> It's so warm
<GOOD> It's midniiiiight
<GOOD> Well 11pm
<GOOD> ~~Elden Ring~~
<GOOD> The bosses look cool from what I've seen design wise at least
<GOOD> Just very busy attack wise
<GOOD> Are they just waves of fire you jump over
<GOOD> Kirby and the Forgotten Land has an attack like that
<GOOD> A few, they're rlly cool
<GOOD> Forgo Leo comes to mind
<GOOD> I saw that fight
<GOOD> That seems like everyone's, and I agree
<GOOD> At least from just watching
<GOOD> No idea how fair they are but they look badass
<GOOD> I can't tell if I'm rusty on Souls, bitter or just genuinely didn't like Elden Ring bc I really didn't feel enough hype for more of it
<GOOD> No super long combos
<GOOD> I think it was the late game that did it in for me
<GOOD> But it's still like a solid 8/10
<GOOD> A fromsoft game I don't like as much is still a fromsoft game at the end of the day
<GOOD> Yea DS2 is in a tier of its own on the very top
<GOOD> Roll iframe stat
<GOOD> Who loves fire giant
Who wants to fight fire giant
<GOOD> Oh wait I'm curious does SoTE have any camera beast bosses
<GOOD> I don't think I've seen every boss yet just the mandatory ones
<GOOD> Imma look at the rest tomorrow probably if they've been uploaded
<GOOD> The new weapons look sick tho I saw ||the great katana's moveset||
<GOOD> And a lot of others
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Seeing some attacks in the DLC I wonder if they're actually possible to dodge with 0 END investment
<GOOD> Yea but a lot of attacks seem particularly frantic
<GOOD> Does anyone know anything about King of Fighters
<GOOD> Heard that NeoGeo could be run on New 3DS XL but there are so many KoF games
<GOOD> I have no idea what to grab
<GOOD> He admitted to it
<GOOD> Also he couldn't have just shut up about it
<GOOD> The investigation turned up evidence for his company to cut him off
<GOOD> He was already cooked
<GOOD> He tried to when he was like It was NEVER PROVEN I talked to kids
<GOOD> He was most likely already on a tight leash or under some sort of duress from lawyers
<GOOD> I was gonna make a PS Vita has no _ joke but I don't really know what it doesn't have
<GOOD> So uhhh have that half of the joke
<GOOD> Still wearing the badge of honour that I lost a long time friend by making too many PS5 jokes
<GOOD> Notice how he couldn't handle that joke, much like the PS5 can't handle having a game
<GOOD> I was genuinely upset af when it happened and then I opened twitter and saw this
<GOOD> They gave 0 prior warning apart from saying this joke is unfunny and then immediately cut me off without asking me to stop
<GOOD> What else am I meant to feel
<GOOD> This was also in a public chat
<GOOD> And they weren't there when I started making the joke
<GOOD> So atp what else can I do except find it really funny that someone cut me off over saying the PS5 has no games
<GOOD> I don't play Persona
<GOOD> Plus like I have 0 friends anyway
<GOOD> I don't think joking about the PS5 not having games is much of an issue for me to tackle
<GOOD> Because I make it clear I'm joking even if it isn't obvious from the statement
<GOOD> Everyone gets a free pass for 1 harmless unfunny joke btw
<GOOD> Does no one else have that 1 joke they find really funny but other ppl don't
<GOOD> Because like ngl I wish I didn't have multiple
<GOOD> I'm criminally unfunny
<GOOD> True but I still wish I was tolerable
<GOOD> That's because the dev was weird
<GOOD> You usually attract the same audience as yourself
<GOOD> I don't think this is the dev but idk
<GOOD> I just remember the cry about it image she posted in response to people saying kissing your brother is wrong and creepy
<GOOD> Who knew putting something gross (not at all in the horror way) in your game would attract an ass fanbase
<GOOD> I also just don't think that even in a horror context you can actually make it disturbing in the way that horror like.... is
<GOOD> Whenever I hear of it I'm not unsettled or upset it's just gross and I'm like ok ig that's ew
<GOOD> By all means write it tho, horror resonates different with different people just don't be weird
<GOOD> Honestly from what I saw they were writing something pretty interesting in TCOAAL in terms of their interactions
<GOOD> But they added that thing and poisoned it
<GOOD> Get this away from me
<GOOD> I feel like I'd feel shame instead
<GOOD> I will use some like, flashy heaven splitting anime move to cleave them out of the image
<GOOD> Exactly just like don't add that
<GOOD> Shrimple
<GOOD> I'm ngl her cry about it reaction to the thing is confusing to me because it can't rlly be interpreted other ways
<GOOD> If you made something to disturb people and they're disturbed, why would you tell people to cry about being disturbed by it (assuming they are)
<GOOD> Was that not your intent
<GOOD> And if people just find it gross then like, yeah I sure hope they do
<GOOD> I thought the girl on the right was wii fit trainer when I saw this post
<GOOD> Wii fit trainer.... save me wii fit trainer....
<GOOD> 3 minutes left raaaa
<GOOD> I'm not a fan of games that aim to be flashes in the pan
<GOOD> Either through sudden bubbles of negative or positive attention
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> Like Palworld
<GOOD> Kinda sunk its teeth in using the bubble of controversy it got
<GOOD> I mean it's a has-been
<GOOD> I'm examining it in retrospect because it's again, a game not made to last
<GOOD> Oh it's my birthday
<GOOD> Ty all
<GOOD> I heard the Dreamcast is cool
<GOOD> Just saw Sonic Rush DS in CEX and the cover has a review calling it the best Sonic game ever
<GOOD> Like pump the brakes a little there mid 2000s game reviewer
<GOOD> I dislike overdesigned fakemons
<GOOD> Just fuckin simplify them
<GOOD> Yea my parents started yelling a bit
<GOOD> But like 7/10 birthday is p good
<GOOD> With this treasure I summon Chiitan, Ad God and Japan's Crazy Mascot
<GOOD> I have 2 weeks to cook the best gift ever for my friend
<GOOD> Ooooh it is?
<GOOD> I'll have to look
<GOOD> Chat
<GOOD> Bomb Rush Cyberfunk or Dragon Quest 11
<GOOD> I've decided on BRC
<GOOD> For mods on top of base game
<GOOD> Made out like a bandit raaaa
<GOOD> Yokai watch
<GOOD> Yea I'm planning to mod the shit out of it
<GOOD> Apparently there are a good few level mods
<GOOD> (Mostly sonic)
<GOOD> Also online multiplayer which is a wild mod to just, make
<GOOD> I want the Miku mod bc they gave her a model in the style of the game
<GOOD> It's so sick
<GOOD> I need to hope the mods don't overlap but imma get soooo many
<GOOD> And this shadow mod ofc I fuckin love Shadow (person who has never played a game with Shadow prominently featured)
<GOOD> Week 1: Steam summer sale
<GOOD> Week 2: ice soup
<GOOD> What is a kigu
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I want a phone case that's cute but my dad will probably call me gay or whatever and never shut the fuck up about it
<GOOD> I love them
<GOOD> The more i discover about the dlc the more glad i am i didn't buy it
<GOOD> Definitely not for me
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> I thought it was some sort of hoax/really polished boss difficulty mod when I first saw it lmaoooo
<GOOD> I actually wanna tbh
<GOOD> I'm absolutely fucking fiending to play MH again ngl
<GOOD> I don't know wby
<GOOD> I wanna play GU
<GOOD> Kratos, you cannot smoke the cabbage of the gods
<GOOD> I might try Greatsword again when I get back to GU
<GOOD> I was already using valor sns
<GOOD> Nvm it was adept
<GOOD> Hooooly fuck MH is awesome
<GOOD> After like a hundred hours of World and 10 of GU I understand
<GOOD> I'm trying Valor GS rn before I get to high rank
<GOOD> And upgrading my current GS to be up to scratch for my first hub quests
<GOOD> 1967 damage?
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Also I tried Valor GS again and I finally understand
<GOOD> They finally got my ass
<GOOD> This makes me sad
<GOOD> Kirby fans after 1 direct that doesn't mention Kirby
<GOOD> And people say the wii u has no games
<GOOD> Also I finally ordered a New 3DS XL
<GOOD> My pet is dying
<GOOD> I thought you said filling for a second and that's a far more terrifying threat
<GOOD> So it *only* gets good in expansions?
<GOOD> I don't get it tho like why would you play it if the base game is bad lol
<GOOD> Am I going crazy that sounds bad
<GOOD> It's like saying Bloodborne would be worth playing if it was straight ass but the Old Hunters was good
<GOOD> But you said the base game isn't as good as the expansions
<GOOD> I wouldn't wanna play 100 hours of mid
<GOOD> Yea like I don't think I've put 100 hours into a game in ages
<GOOD> Not even my favourites
<GOOD> Oh god this is the One Piece thing but it isn't a joke
<GOOD> Yeah because it's 100 hours long
<GOOD> And to my understanding you have to subscribe to play either it or its expansions
<GOOD> Are the expansions free
<GOOD> Uh huh
<GOOD> Oh I'm well aware it just seems incredibly hard to sell anyone on it gets good after one hundred hours
<GOOD> Like even if it's kinda ok to pretty good, 100 hours is like
<GOOD> That's multiple weeks of playing nothing but FF14
<GOOD> Also what does this refer to
<GOOD> I thought the post expansion stuff was the good part
<GOOD> And the pre expansion stuff was bad
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Wait then wdym the post expansions were also draining
<GOOD> I thought the draining part was at the start not also after
<GOOD> 100+ hours for 7/10
<GOOD> I just made a Lalafel and then played a few hours, realised I was just slowly walking around blowing shit up and turned it off
<GOOD> I mean as I said it seems like an insane sell
<GOOD> Like pitching FF14 to someone sounds impossible
<GOOD> How many do you need lmfao
<GOOD> Ate my reply
<GOOD> I meant the buttons
<GOOD> Honestly w how fast those inputs registered it's kinda crazu
<GOOD> I just flung pyromancy at him and used the jellyfish
<GOOD> Then gave up on pyromancy like 5 seconds later because everything resists fire
<GOOD> I might replay DS1R tbh
<GOOD> I'm ngl Elden Ring is bafflingly easy
<GOOD> If you allow it for yourself
<GOOD> Radahn lmao
<GOOD> You can literally just run away and the fight wins itself
<GOOD> I think I only used ashes on a few bosses in my first play through
<GOOD> And 1 summon but I regretted it because it ruined the fight lol
<GOOD> Can you even dodge some of his attacks at RL1
<GOOD> I imagine with no END investment some attacks become insanely hard to dodge
<GOOD> They're long asf and seem to need a good few rolls
<GOOD> All good then
<GOOD> Just from a spectator standpoint it doesn't look fun
<GOOD> Idk if it's hard since if you stick to him it's fine but he doesn't look fun compared to the others
<GOOD> And he reminds me of those DS3 pvp boss fight modders lmao
<GOOD> Like I don't doubt I could beat his ass but some of those bosses straight up don't look fun
<GOOD> God some of those dodges
<GOOD> Literally stood inside him to dodge an attack
<GOOD> Standing between his legs to avoid the charge
<GOOD> I HAVE 35 HOURS ON GU ALREADY?
<GOOD> I'm not even out of low rank bruh I been grinding too much
<GOOD> Just stole an egg from a shiny dragon dude
<GOOD> The dragon has its own theme and its a banger
<GOOD> My ass running
<GOOD> BRO WTF
<GOOD> TIGREX NEEDS TO CHILL
<GOOD> I also killed the entire fated 4 before this I've been on a binge
<GOOD> I fw bowser he loves hags
<GOOD> This dude doesn't
<GOOD> What is bros problem lmao
<GOOD> I mean it's better than him being a transphobe in the OG JP stuff but lmaoooo
<GOOD> We aren't doing this
<GOOD> Curse Rotted Greatwood
<GOOD> I've been thinking about upgrading from moss balls to something marginally more demanding
<GOOD> Moss balls require replacing their water every 2 weeks and rolling them a little
<GOOD> I just want a slightly higher maintenance plant tbh
<GOOD> Just something that makes me get up in the morning to water it once
<GOOD> The voting was fast for me at least
<GOOD> Not like it's gonna matter
<GOOD> I voted Libdem since their policies seemed good enough
<GOOD> And the area around here has been labour for actual decades
<GOOD> I don't like Sunak
<GOOD> I'm ngl I didn't give it an insane amount of thought, not even sure if there is a green rep in my area
<GOOD> Did I make a mistake
<GOOD> I saw
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I just want the Bulborb
<GOOD> Bulborb nendoroid.... Save me
<GOOD> No mondy
<GOOD> My New 3DS XL I splurged for for my birthday arrived today
<GOOD> I'm gonna hack it
<GOOD> How can you tell
<GOOD> Wait what
<GOOD> I've never seen this before
<GOOD> My dad trying not to be a complete asshole that bitches about me not liking what he likes 24/7
<GOOD> It's scary how people just don't do introspection because like he'll act like he regrets having us over fucking football while simultaneously having attempted any extended interaction with what we like 0 times
<GOOD> I heard it was unfair af so that checks out
<GOOD> Are you using everything the game gives or challenging yourself
<GOOD> Niiiice
<GOOD> When I saw bleed builds dropping him in like 3 jump attacks I just gave up lol
<GOOD> Bleed is so boringly broken like why can't smth else be busted
<GOOD> More DPS than any build in the game minus like the insane sorcery builds w setup but it also usually has faster attacks
<GOOD> Apparently he's bugged and if you're in the air at the right time during his big jump attack he loses you and falls back down
<GOOD> I find that incredibly funny
<GOOD> It's not even that strict
<GOOD> Yeah but it's not like a dodgd
<GOOD> He just doesn't do the attack
<GOOD> He literally spawns in again without the second half of it and lands
<GOOD> I think I can find the clip idk
<GOOD> Nvm I can't
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I love Chibi
<GOOD> Also Kat SF2 Turbo has ass inputs lmao
<GOOD> I tried doing Bison's head stomp and holy fuck it's impossible to do consistently for some reason
<GOOD> Finding out my childhood main of Vega is that broken
<GOOD> And it's almost exactly for the reason I thought as a kif
<GOOD> Monster Hunter is so fucking fun
<GOOD> I'm officially in High Rank GU
<GOOD> I should play Rise at some point but I'm 50 hours into GU rn with no end in sight
<GOOD> I did pick up Hunting Horn today tho and it's by far the funnest weapon
<GOOD> At least rn
<GOOD> I have become obscenely strong with Rath armour + Tigrex HH + some decos
<GOOD> And Valor
<GOOD> I mean HH is basically XAXAXA until the monster does something and then you Valor sheath
<GOOD> And occasionally remembering you need to keep alternating the songs
<GOOD> Although in solo I just cycle from Attack S to Self Improvement and back
<GOOD> GU is way better than World for me
<GOOD> Just embarrassed myself in a MH server by asking about a PSP AR game featuring Tigrex from my childhood
<GOOD> This was the game lmao his ass is NOT Tigrex
<GOOD> Ooh
<GOOD> I have no idea this was just one of those brain blast nostalgia things
<GOOD> Like Gormiti but I remember a lot more about that
<GOOD> And Kung Fu Dino Posse but I only remember the opening to that
<GOOD> HIDDEN TALENT KEEP IT HIDDEN
<GOOD> THIS SHIT STRAIGHT ASS
<GOOD> Also the character designs are horrendous they look like sonas but not good sonas
<GOOD> Mid 2000s animated show when women
<GOOD> Also fun fact as a kid I created like a massive lore story arc or whatever tf in my head that just kept going and for some reason this design fucked so hard that it was the main villain of that lore
<GOOD> Or at least a changed version of it
<GOOD> Glamrock China
<GOOD> I think I also used to watch uhh
<GOOD> Pet Squad?
<GOOD> I think that was it unless my brother watched that
<GOOD> I also watched Samsam
<GOOD> Oml I just looked for the villain of that show and this image popped up and I'm losing it
<GOOD> Why is it so funny to me
<GOOD> I don't even speak Spanish
<GOOD> Apparently this is what jt looked like
<GOOD> The robot design is so ass
<GOOD> He just has like a massive fucking down arrow on him like what
<GOOD> I've never watched it but I know exactly what you mean
<GOOD> Tbh I might rewatch Inazuma Eleven and Ultimate Muscle
<GOOD> They're the 2 most prominent shows I watched in my childhood that I remember
<GOOD> this opening is awesome but like 10% of it rhymes when it feels like it should all rhyme and I find that hilarious
<GOOD> Go to CEX and look at the 50p DS games
<GOOD> Also I bought someone that exact same game
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> You could also buy them 1 DVDs
<GOOD> Or one of those shitty pet/baby/princess/fashion model games
<GOOD> Curse of Cory
<GOOD> Was it caused by giving her that wtf
<GOOD> If I speak
<GOOD> There is also the squeakquel and chipwrecked but idk how much it is
<GOOD> Follow up with Ted 3
<GOOD> You need something of this kinda crustiness
<GOOD> Licensed but not actually wanted or even necessarily known about
<GOOD> Relic of the DS era
<GOOD> Maybe get some of this going on
<GOOD> Lost media
<GOOD> Maybe it's just critically acclaimed
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> Get them the really shit GT game I've been playing
<GOOD> Nvm it's GBA not DS
<GOOD> Get them Supersonic Warriors 2 and run a set
<GOOD> Damn you aren't?
<GOOD> Unfortunate
<GOOD> Wait wdym the Simpsons game got a DS port
<GOOD> OH WAIT
<GOOD> The Ratatouille DS game is stinky I played it as a kid
<GOOD> Or this lmfao what is this
<GOOD> This is the game over screen I'm crying
<GOOD> There's more of those btw
<GOOD> Although the manage your weight one is probably too mean
<GOOD> Yeah I love it
<GOOD> Also I've never seen this render of Gru before it looks made just for this game
<GOOD> I have to do GU Hub quests bc I've been neglecting them
<GOOD> I slept through a political assassination wtf lmao
<GOOD> Or an attempted one
<GOOD> I slept a while
<GOOD> Also yes
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> I'm honestly in a crisis rn
<GOOD> Would appreciate a distraction
<GOOD> Not really tbh, it's over
<GOOD> Superstar saga is awesome
<GOOD> Hmmm maybe my first exposure to resident evil should be this 3DS game
<GOOD> Whar
<GOOD> Haiiii
<GOOD> I am watching Shikonokonokonoko anime
<GOOD> Shikonokonokono koshontantan
<GOOD> This gif is in thd opening btw
<GOOD> I'm also taking other recommendations of what to watch
<GOOD> I gotta do Gravity Falls at some point tbh
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I always skip the ass eps when I do
<GOOD> Most of them are in SC
<GOOD> Nah she's a deer
<GOOD> Normal deer
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Close enough
<GOOD> Nyaaa
<GOOD> Am I missing something
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I was missing something...
<GOOD> I found them
<GOOD> AUGH
<GOOD> FALIN
<GOOD> FALIN I NEED TO BE YOU
<GOOD> Buneary
<GOOD> It reminds me of something else also
<GOOD> Remaking my top 49
<GOOD> In order this time
<GOOD> Erm.... Pokmon own greenish fire rodents now??
<GOOD> Dragon Quest did it first.... *Shows picture of mythological beast also using fire and having 4 legs*
<GOOD> They wanna be Yo Kai Watch so bad
<GOOD> I think after Kid Icarus Uprising imma play YKW2
<GOOD> Since this game is short as fuck
<GOOD> God I love yokai watch designs
<GOOD> Roughraff is one of my favourites
<GOOD> Me with Neon White
<GOOD> And Factorio
<GOOD> Fuck factorio devs man their philosophy is so ass
<GOOD> I'm not actually that pressed about it but this game will never go on sale so people that bought it full price won't be ripped off is dumb
<GOOD> It's 35
<GOOD> Like that's a lot
<GOOD> Idk what this means
<GOOD> Politics hurt my brain I just pick the party and policies that don't harm me as much as the other ones
<GOOD> And other people
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> back in my day we fought in wars type shit
<GOOD> I mean that view is something my dad probably has lol
<GOOD> He always saying something or other about Donald Trump and he gives me that vibe
<GOOD> Tories is right wing so my dad is already way too far gone past that lol
<GOOD> He boasted about how he voted for the literal most harmful party possible that also faked candidates existing
<GOOD> Our left wing is also right wing so the right wing party is further right
<GOOD> Our centrist party's policies are literally more left wing than the left wing party it's sad
<GOOD> And Green party is dumb bc they want to get rid of nuclear
<GOOD> And have kinda mid policies in general
<GOOD> I'm trying to tell if my dad denies climate change rn
<GOOD> It's my latest escapade
<GOOD> He seems fairly adamant it's not getting warmer every year
<GOOD> We don't have AC
<GOOD> Also I got fucked up like 2 months ago reading about Wet Bulb for the first time
<GOOD> I hate this planet and also humans
<GOOD> Basically air gets saturated with water at higher temperatures which makes vaporisation and heat loss by sweating harder and harder
<GOOD> Until inevitably it gets so warm we can't lose heat and boil in our own skin
<GOOD> Uhhhhhhhhhh
<GOOD> It was gonna be SF and maybe Darkstalkers mostly
<GOOD> Well if the heat of the air around us is increasing then air gets saturated and humid
<GOOD> If the air is humid we can't lose heat through sweat vaporisation
<GOOD> Well yes but many countries get humid when it is warm lol
<GOOD> And if that humidity is too high we die
<GOOD> Closer than you think
<GOOD> It's like over 35C at high humidity apparently
<GOOD> I'll probably watch back at some point
<GOOD> My dad gonna be on my ass for the next few weeks
<GOOD> Oooo
<GOOD> It was ye
<GOOD> I'll probably watch some other time
<GOOD> I'm watching my graph
<GOOD> Making
<GOOD> Making my graph
<GOOD> Sure but I can watch the vod back right
<GOOD> It has to be very high humidity combined w that temperature
<GOOD> For 3S I'm probably gonna watch pools so I see random mfs squaring up w low tiers
<GOOD> Any amount is a big deal
<GOOD> Also that's just this year
<GOOD> In different climates at higher temperatures we could lose hundreds of thousands of lives
<GOOD> Because people simply can't cool down
<GOOD> Mostly the elderly
<GOOD> Ladidadida
<GOOD> I just yawned the second this gif came on my screen wtf
<GOOD> Anyway my biggest fear is that I'll still be alive to see the fallout of what we've caused
<GOOD> Which I imagine is what most generations feel
<GOOD> Okok
<GOOD> I'm kinda tweaking rn so watching streams is tough
<GOOD> I'm a lot more controlled in this house so I can do less shit I like
<GOOD> Also speaking of, I want to play SMT because of Jack Frost
<GOOD> This reminds me of Super Paper Mario
<GOOD> I can't really describe how
<GOOD> Dog
<GOOD> Is this what Arctibax is partially based on
<GOOD> That third dude is from Hylics you can't convince me otherwise
<GOOD> I tried playing Hylics for half an hour and it made me scared and confused and headache
<GOOD> Ik headache isn't an emotion but it felt like one
<GOOD> Where's the rubberhose one
<GOOD> I love rubberhose
<GOOD> It's an animation style characterised by like, black and white era early Disney
<GOOD> Like Oswald, Felix the Cat, Betty Boop kinda era
<GOOD> The traced Cuphead animation!?!?!?!?
<GOOD> And of course
<GOOD> Nuh uh it's just a Rubberhose Rampage reference
<GOOD> I love Rubberhose Rampage....
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> Fun fact Bendy was invented in the 1920s and the game is based off the old character
<GOOD> I never wanna replay BATIM because I know it's gonna be ass and I'm gonna like it less
<GOOD> Also if I speak they may kill me (I think Poppy Playtime is better than BATIM)
<GOOD> At least so far
<GOOD> I wanna pat it on the head and then swing it around like Mario 64
<GOOD> By mathematical do you mean it's made out of like, line functions and stuff
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Cuz like cmon dude it isn't even fair lmaooo
<GOOD> Need a hand?? Headass
<GOOD> I like Catnap more purely based on how he's implemented, let alone design
<GOOD> Pizza Tower has no monster collecting, lots of punching shit and isn't chill
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Dark Revival is actually good tho
<GOOD> Or at least a lot better
<GOOD> And it's getting another game soon too
<GOOD> The new design FUCKS
<GOOD> I absolutely love this one
<GOOD> So much better than BATIM ink demon
<GOOD> BATIM ink demon is this one
<GOOD> Poppy Playtime also actually has kinda cool areas and puzzles
<GOOD> Nah he's the little devil thing who was brought to life on the silver screen
<GOOD> Poppy Playtime
<GOOD> It's a game title
<GOOD> If Final Fantasy 14 isn't confusing this shouldn't be
<GOOD> Fairly sure Poppy Playtime is a name too
<GOOD> It's very good yes
<GOOD> Catnap was awesome
<GOOD> Good body horror too w the dogday scene
<GOOD> Charlie smiling Friends chained up to the wall
<GOOD> Meatly is also pretty shit
<GOOD> Although less so
<GOOD> Fairly sure they aren't involved anymore
<GOOD> I used to own the PS4 version physically for some reason
<GOOD> Very bizarre item
<GOOD> If Garten of Banban ever gets a physical switch release I'm copping
<GOOD> Dude I love Banban tho
<GOOD> I caught up with a friend after a whole year and the first thing we did was randomly start talking about Banban
<GOOD> Apparently we've both been keeping up
<GOOD> Also can I say I find it really funny that Hello Neighbour is classed as a mascot horror game
<GOOD> Like that's just a man
<GOOD> Ik it is mascot horror but it's really funny that the mascot in question is a middle aged man with a stan smith chin
<GOOD> SCP Containment Breach mentioned
<GOOD> That supercomputer is such a hater in every SCP game I love it
<GOOD> Fnaf
<GOOD> Scott made that one with pure hater energy tho
<GOOD> Baldi ruined for me by the very crude but also funny fan song
<GOOD> /j
<GOOD> Fnaf fangames have so many gems at least
<GOOD> I can't wait for Popgoes Evergreen
<GOOD> It's almost here
<GOOD> And TJOC Reignited is getting a demo the same week
<GOOD> I hate to break this to you but we basically already did
<GOOD> FNaF World is like pretty much that
<GOOD> And FNaF AR Is also that
<GOOD> But it's Go style monster catching
<GOOD> They're both like 1 step away
<GOOD> I will gas up fnaf world always
<GOOD> It gave actually good Nightmare Designs (for the OG 4, Nightmarionne is already good and Fredbear and Nightmare are aight)
<GOOD> I will also excuse Nightmare Foxy
<GOOD> Although I wish he had that tongue
<GOOD> Well every animatronic was changed for fnaf world
<GOOD> The Adventure designs are sometimes awesome lowkey
<GOOD> I'm referring to the adventure nightmares
<GOOD> Because the base fnaf 4 ones are uh
<GOOD> Not great
<GOOD> Adventure is the genre of animatronic in FNaF world
<GOOD> Like Toy, Nightmare etc
<GOOD> Although since there are toys in the game it's Adventure Nightmare instead of just Adventure
<GOOD> Fnaf world
<GOOD> The chibi designs are called Adventure animatronics
<GOOD> So the Adventure Nightmares are the chibi Nightmares in FNaF World
<GOOD> Is it that hard to follow
<GOOD> /gen
<GOOD> Nightmare Bonnie vs Adventure Nightmare Bonnie
<GOOD> I rlly dislike how Nightmare Bonnie looks in 4
<GOOD> He looks good in Glitched Attraction tho
<GOOD> I like Foxy and Nightmarionne
<GOOD> And Fredbear gets a pass
<GOOD> Yes I know
<GOOD> Glad a lot of fangames retain the OG FNaF vibes
<GOOD> Like Mary's Arcade
<GOOD> Holy FUCK that game is uncanny
<GOOD> Like oml how gorgeous
<GOOD> And Mary's Arcade has like, a stuttery camera that has visual glitches and distortions that actually happen on shitty security footage it's awesome
<GOOD> Plus it has a really tense movement system where it doesn't even have doors at all
<GOOD> And it's a version of that that isn't shit like FNaF 3
<GOOD> It's pretty good but Springtrap is bullshit
<GOOD> Once you understand how he works it's really annoying bc he's so unruly lol
<GOOD> He has a 10% chance to ignore audio lures which is
<GOOD> Bad
<GOOD> Because he moves so quickly sometimes
<GOOD> I was too intimidated by it but I love the Xenomorph
<GOOD> This mf made me the most stressed I've been at a game in a hot minute
<GOOD> At least Pik 2
<GOOD> I didn't lose he's just so stressful lmfao
<GOOD> In horror games I am fine w it
<GOOD> As long as they aren't absurdly hard to avoid
<GOOD> My OC band needs a 5th member but I have no sea creature inspiration
<GOOD> I'm thinking a techie with a mantis shrimp styled mech
<GOOD> Or have them be based on a symbiotic duo like Remora and Sharks
<GOOD> Chiitan is canon non binary
<GOOD> They also donate to trans charities when ppl ask to donate on their behalf
<GOOD> They are also the sweetest thing ever
<GOOD> They made me cry
<GOOD> Tbf I don't agree with instakills in horror super often
<GOOD> It's just a lot more understandable
<GOOD> My usual biggest gripe is like, instakills in stealth missions in games
<GOOD> I prefer it when getting spotted stacks improbable but not impossible odds against you
<GOOD> I still haven't played an RE game
<GOOD> Or Silent Hill
<GOOD> I can only rlly play the PS1 and 2 ones and Revelations
<GOOD> Oh hi Obie
<GOOD> Good and bad
<GOOD> Right now I'm trying to get ideas for art
<GOOD> I need 1 more OC for my Splatoon band
<GOOD> Why the fuck is it so warm in here
<GOOD> I can't draw men it's so annoying
<GOOD> I don't rlly want to
<GOOD> Especially with inklings I make them all fem or androgynous by accident
<GOOD> This is what I'm cooking rn
<GOOD> Engineer based on cleaner fish and their inventions are species that benefit
<GOOD> I usually just make them enby by accident bc it's what I think fits best
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> Jester....
<GOOD> Creaturas
<GOOD> Augh I'm still going
<GOOD> It's so slow
<GOOD> Idk who comes after Moon
<GOOD> Void Soul
<GOOD> I love Janemba
<GOOD> I missed some wild shit apparently lmaooo
<GOOD> Does evo have a YT channel with uploads of the fights
<GOOD> It makes me wanna play 3S
<GOOD> Crying
<GOOD> Fish
<GOOD> I've been playing Kid Icarus
<GOOD> Pit is awesome I think he would say Skibidi Ohio Rizz
<GOOD> And then Palutena would take his wings away
<GOOD> I'm enjoying it very much
<GOOD> I'm also watching Edgerunners later bc Strive has finally encouraged me to
<GOOD> I need to get the MU info on Lucy
<GOOD> Idk much about Dark Pit yet except he's funny
<GOOD> Bro literally said I found you faker
<GOOD> I'm not ready for her fans tbh
<GOOD> There's gonna be a horde of simps
<GOOD> Gato
<GOOD> I can't ignore
<GOOD> Psy kick
<GOOD> Also it probably gets Morning Sun or smth
<GOOD> But that's later
<GOOD> I thought it was that
<GOOD> Her hair made me think of it for some reason
<GOOD> Oh em gee new Kagurabachi chapter
<GOOD> I'm hyped
<GOOD> Abra isn't that
<GOOD> You make the same gender kiss
<GOOD> True my flag is like a mark on my neck
<GOOD> And then I take off my shirt and the entirety of my back is an elaborate back tattoo of the NB flag
<GOOD> I hate discord lag
<GOOD> Honestly I'm wondering if we get just her (incredibly bizarre) or we get more of them
<GOOD> Because like who else would even fit
<GOOD> Me in Season Pass 7 getting mixed by Senshi 632K
<GOOD> Like who tf even fits the bill it's so funny she's even there
<GOOD> They gonna get Loid Forger in there
<GOOD> This is like the youtube cancer tweet
<GOOD> I love kobolds
<GOOD> I should pick this manga up
<GOOD> Secret stones???
<GOOD> It reminds me of the cell saga video essay
<GOOD> I keep getting recommended this vid and the thumbnail is just a speech bubble of Cell saying everything I'm about to say is a plot hole and I always find shit like that funny
<GOOD> Because he definitely didn't say that shit
<GOOD> 1 is good
<GOOD> 2
<GOOD> I think you're on your own on this one
<GOOD> 2 is HGSS without even the minor QoL it adds
<GOOD> Like idk running
<GOOD> And the fact most of the dex can't evolve
<GOOD> Like fuck yeah Aipom
<GOOD> Yanma is good enough as is?
<GOOD> Or Togetic?
<GOOD> Hell even Misdreavus
<GOOD> Can't evolve this gen
<GOOD> If you can even find one
<GOOD> Also unevolved Gligar
<GOOD> And Sneasel
<GOOD> Piloswine is ok it gets a pass for being kind of usable
<GOOD> Aipom is the most fucked imo
<GOOD> Like why is it a single stage
<GOOD> They're both gen 4
<GOOD> Is baton pass not just a switch in gen 2
<GOOD> Not like Aipom has setup moves
<GOOD> Except maybe hone claws idk
<GOOD> Transfers what
<GOOD> Does Aipom get boosts to transfer
<GOOD> I don't think Aipom's stats are decent enough to be a good gen 2 normal type considering the competition it has
<GOOD> Girafarig mogs it in atk and also has 90 spatk, and more speed
<GOOD> Also yes against Stantler
<GOOD> Because Stantler hits harder and faster too
<GOOD> Not to mention its gen 1 competition
<GOOD> Hell, even Furret is faster and about 1 point stronger
<GOOD> *6
<GOOD> Ok misconception Girafarig is only as fast as it
<GOOD> Not in TMs
<GOOD> Once you get Headbutt you can cruise anyway
<GOOD> It has pretty good tms tho wdym
<GOOD> It's mostly a STAB bot but it has decent applicable ones
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Kill
<GOOD> Also Murkrow was unevolved too
<GOOD> If we're talking play through then I'd prefer my Honch
<GOOD> That's like most of the gen 2 dex tho lol
<GOOD> They're all like, 80 in an offensive stat with a 70 speed tier
<GOOD> Then the few bulky ones are like rlly bulky for some reason
<GOOD> Cats are fighting outside my home
<GOOD> Calcing their attacks rn
<GOOD> I can't say calc in a VGC sense anymore because it makes me laugh irl
<GOOD> Same as cancel because of the video of the same guy
<GOOD> Addicted to stupid shit like this
<GOOD> Eminem latest album
<GOOD> Because he looks weak
<GOOD> Like most of the dex
<GOOD> Like Tauros compared to stantler is lmao
<GOOD> I don't mind some mons being quaint but there's like 2 full evo lines in Johto
<GOOD> And 1 is Jumpluff
<GOOD> 2 stages don't count btw don't sneak Arifraudos in here
<GOOD> Yeah that's why Ledian is better
<GOOD> My GOAT, glorious 110 special defense
<GOOD> And 85 speed
<GOOD> Fantastic stats
<GOOD> And double screens like zamn Ledian treating u
<GOOD> It gets both screens at the same level tbf
<GOOD> Fraud...
<GOOD> Can't even set screens in midgame playthrough, dattebayo
<GOOD> Ok but Ledian gets Baton Pass at Level 33 did you consider that
<GOOD> And also Safeguard at the same level of the other 2 screens
<GOOD> Triple screens and you're set
<GOOD> Honestly safeguard kinda goated for Johto bc of all the bullshit status spam
<GOOD> Also stops confusion so like that's kinda goated for Morty
<GOOD> Wait what lmao in gen 2 only Safeguard stops confusion from moves like Thrash
<GOOD> The goat...
<GOOD> Ledian gets Agility at a stupid high level
<GOOD> Just use that strat in Sinnoh
<GOOD> Kanto I mean
<GOOD> Why did they do this only in gen 5 and after
<GOOD> This is so specific lmao why would they be so mean
<GOOD> Ok what I'm learning 6 eps into Edgerunners is that Potemkin is gonna be a good matchup
<GOOD> I couldn't help drawing
<GOOD> Updated le chart
<GOOD> Also Edgerunners made me ill like genuinely I think I'm sick now
<GOOD> But mostly sad
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I haven't watched the boys
<GOOD> Also do you have the video of this but it cuts to Sol Badguy
<GOOD> I don't particularly want to anyway bc like gratuitous gore for no reason doesn't interest me that much
<GOOD> I mean I've read Berserk it just has to be used well
<GOOD> But in The Boys it just seems to be done constantly and hamfistedly for grossout purposes
<GOOD> This is the greatest day of my LIFE
<GOOD> I found the gif I was looking for
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Me rn actually because I did the exact same thing
<GOOD> Chat how do y'all deal with transphobia from like
Everywhere
<GOOD> I'm kinda struggling
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I'm afraid to even come out irl
<GOOD> Apart from a handful of people
<GOOD> My dad has said on multiple occasions he'll disown me if I'm trans
<GOOD> So like lmao
<GOOD> Then I'm afraid of putting a giant target on myself by being trans in this shithole country
<GOOD> Not to even speak of shit happening online which yk
<GOOD> Tldr even if I cut myself off from everything it's still everywhere
<GOOD> Augh whatever we ball or something
<GOOD> Khezu theme
<GOOD> If I wasn't sick as fuck rn I'd be playing hub GU
<GOOD> There's actually a timer because Mx is registered to the uni and therefore is going on my degree unless I change it back which I would hate
<GOOD> My dad would fold too but no idea how the rest of my family would react
<GOOD> My extended family is also transphobic tho
<GOOD> In fact basically all of them are either transphobes, otherwise horrible people, substance abusers or all 3
<GOOD> Plus like idk them that well
<GOOD> This shit so ass
<GOOD> I never have
<GOOD> My dad hates em too for some reason or another and they don't like him
<GOOD> Because as much as I don't want to I will interact with them on occasion
<GOOD> He hates them because they don't like him or don't feed his ego, one or the other
<GOOD> Fairly sure he cut off his aunt because of a Christmas card or will disputes or smth
<GOOD> Like the dude hasn't self reflected in his life
<GOOD> At least not as long as I've remembered
<GOOD> Accepting enough but she still uses the T slur because she doesn't realise it's wrong (I assume)
<GOOD> I never scoped it out properly BC it's risky to be asking around
<GOOD> Yea but it hasn't come up since
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> I already asked her to try and encourage my dad to be less violently racist and she seems on board w that
<GOOD> He already wishes he had different kids bc we don't like football
<GOOD> I don't think he'd fw a trans kid, but I'll start taking steps to get there
<GOOD> He loudly and exasperated-ly says it most times the football is on
<GOOD> He's always loud and exasperated
<GOOD> Literally makes groaning/sighing noises if someone gets up to go to the bathroom
<GOOD> He is truly a very unbalanced man
<GOOD> I think the dude just hates everything bc like I've never seen him enjoy stuff and he's just complaining about everything that happens all the time
<GOOD> If anyone disagrees he just yells at them to not start an argument
<GOOD> As if he doesn't constantly say things that are wrong
<GOOD> And my brother
<GOOD> But my brother is 12 and going through his edgy phase rn
<GOOD> My mom don't stand up to him either is the problem
<GOOD> He treats her like he treats us bc he has a massive ego that gets annoying when it isn't stroked
<GOOD> All in the house tho bc as loud as he is about not being afraid to voice his opinions he doesn't do it loudly in public
<GOOD> Because he a bitch
<GOOD> The most pissed I've seen him at people outside the house are when he says he wants to kill dogs often for being annoying and to the oblivious old lady downstairs
<GOOD> Which yk, concerning that it's a pattern even if it started as jokes
<GOOD> Ermmmm sorry got too silly!!!
<GOOD> Racist
<GOOD> Shocking, truly
<GOOD> Except when he talks about minorities constantly
<GOOD> He hates everyone dwbi
<GOOD> He was racist towards a black child and mother for like multiple days in a row bc in a Lidl the child was touching the donuts in the bakery
<GOOD> Which are out in the open
<GOOD> Couldn't stop talking about it
<GOOD> Yeah I don't mean to be rude but he's kinda problematic............
<GOOD> Same day he was racist against jewish people and I think he also mocked gay or pakistani people I don't remember
<GOOD> He already watches Joe Rogan
<GOOD> And its comments and qrts
<GOOD> It's literally just taking engagement bait casual pokemon jokes and replacing it with Hala
<GOOD> Honestly I don't think it'll work
<GOOD> He doesn't seem the type to give a shit what I say because he scolds me when I don't act like the child he wants instead of myself
<GOOD> Like literally he called me a know it all mf with a huge ego because I said multiple weeks ago I don't think that zoo has sloths and I was wrong
<GOOD> Exactlyyyy
<GOOD> He has friends in racial minorities it just doesn't compute to him
<GOOD> Like he's racist until it's people he knows because they're his friends and therefore not that minority ig
<GOOD> Def makes fun of that same friend for being fat tho, he used to threaten my brother by saying he'd call him up and he'd come over and eat him which is
<GOOD> A bizarre threat to make
<GOOD> Even as a joke
<GOOD> Because he doesn't make it to the dude's face lmao
<GOOD> I like SM Lusamine
<GOOD> Idk about USUM because I haven't finished it
<GOOD> I wanna draw Hala now
<GOOD> Rebecca should have been added instead of Lucy
<GOOD> I already play Strive infrequently
<GOOD> I watched Edgerunners bc Lucy was revealed
<GOOD> I suck ass
<GOOD> I can't put any labbed combos into practice
<GOOD> I just play Faust and Bedman and occasionally Bridget and pray
<GOOD> Maybe Bedman less so in favour of learning ABA
<GOOD> I wanna try Slayer
<GOOD> I'm out here Piling my Bunker I got BRC up rn I'm dandy as fuck man I'm a Slayer
<GOOD> It's the time investment tbh
<GOOD> I wanna play a lot of games and fighting games are depth not breadth
<GOOD> Rn I have like 100 games in my 3DS to inject
<GOOD> Well they're injected I gotta play em
<GOOD> I think I'm like floor 5 rn
<GOOD> Getting filtered by Happy Chaos mains
<GOOD> I need to do this with the Arbok panel but I split Hala in half
<GOOD> I like Elphelt
<GOOD> Haven't played her tho
<GOOD> I wanna learn ABA
<GOOD> But like she's so ass without her install
<GOOD> I understand the mechanics of fighting games decently (minus actual FGC turns like meaty and oki)
<GOOD> But awful practical application
<GOOD> I understand DP And Tatsu at least
<GOOD> Ok but I love throwing out Faust Mix Mix Mix in neutral
<GOOD> See I understand that one
<GOOD> I can't *do* a DP consistently but oh well
<GOOD> I used to play Eyes of Heaven w friends lmao
<GOOD> It only had a few Z inputs tho and none on the chars I played
<GOOD> Ok gimme a bit my meds are setting
<GOOD> And I'm burning up
<GOOD> I have covid I think
<GOOD> This feels like ass
<GOOD> I'll probably learn Bridget instead
<GOOD> She only has 1 iirc
<GOOD> And it's her command grab
<GOOD> Naw I love spamming Kick Start my Heart constantly
<GOOD> It's my favourite move
<GOOD> (I don't remember numpad notation well enough)
<GOOD> Well I can remember numpad but not the letters at the end that correspond to the buttons
<GOOD> I was gonna play Testament
<GOOD> But they're rlly slow
<GOOD> Like their attacks were lethargic
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I heard strive has like no disjoints
<GOOD> With Lucy coming I'm considering Goldlewis bc of my friend
<GOOD> I LOVE 236
<GOOD> Oh that's uh
<GOOD> 896 mb
<GOOD> Numpad confusing
<GOOD> I felt like a god after doing a Bedman wallbreak combo tbh
<GOOD> Trans people containment unit
<GOOD> What is a rekka
<GOOD> I like it
<GOOD> Oh like Kick Start My Heart
<GOOD> Yea Bridget can either jump, jump and attack or turn iirc
<GOOD> Very useful I may look at Elphelt
<GOOD> I think that's almost the same
<GOOD> Like I think Bridget's turn is a low
<GOOD> And the regular attack is a high but idk
<GOOD> Oooo
<GOOD> I'm enjoying the ide of Elphelt
<GOOD> Idea
<GOOD> And if Lucy turns out to be annoying
<GOOD> That last one seems like hell to block for anyone in low floors lol
<GOOD> Even if it's just blocking a high then a low
<GOOD> I also will try Slayer at some point BC he's funny
<GOOD> Is S safe
<GOOD> Or is it punishable by just attacking in the endlaag of each S
<GOOD> Thought do
<GOOD> teehee, I have you now Guilty Gearguy! This rekka loops infinitely!
Sol f.s:
<GOOD> (I think it's less than 6 frames it feels like it idk)
<GOOD> I just like Sol f.S it's funny
<GOOD> I just get caught out by f.S because sometimes I'll risk it and lead the match with a raw attack w windup
<GOOD> And then get absolutely filtered by it
<GOOD> Or raw H iirc
<GOOD> I don't remember what attack it is but it has reach
<GOOD> Faust lows at the start of the match go crazy tho
<GOOD> 6H then
<GOOD> Actually probably S
<GOOD> It's p fast
<GOOD> Nah not that then
<GOOD> Thd horizontal slash
<GOOD> True but I'm stupid
<GOOD> Um yeah
<GOOD> The funny
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> I wanna olay smth tomorrow when I feel better
<GOOD> I might decide on what today
<GOOD> Wtf Inside Out 2 is the biggest animated movie ever?
<GOOD> Realistic depiction of a panic attack
<GOOD> Are you gonna say Lion King
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> I too thought of that joke
<GOOD> Well half joke
<GOOD> Can't wait for inside out 3
<GOOD> I think Rebecca Edgerunners is in my emotion tower thing
<GOOD> I thought the landscape was real
<GOOD> Bo2
<GOOD> And Bo3
<GOOD> I used to play it too
<GOOD> And my dad used to play TDM
<GOOD> I remember the boat map was awesome
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Black ops 2
<GOOD> I'm so ASS without tone indicators
<GOOD> I remember nuketown and hijacked and that's it
<GOOD> The others blend into Infinite Warfare a bit
<GOOD> Oh and the map that's like, a modern ish house
<GOOD> I can't find it but there was like, a bunch of glass panels around those rock garden things
<GOOD> And parked cars and stuff
<GOOD> And there was a central area w statues and stuff
<GOOD> It's called Raid
<GOOD> USUM, ORAS, SM, XY
<GOOD> This era was the BEST era of Pokmon
<GOOD> We can all agree the Kahuna walking down to the Laguna era was the best era of Pokemon right???
<GOOD> It's the trope of Twitter engagement bait posts about Pokmon but the punchline is just Hala
<GOOD> I think we ALL felt like this when we walked into this house in Undella Town
<GOOD> I need to draw one
<GOOD> I feel like drawing Hala
<GOOD> Let's be honest, we all cried at this......
And remember when we thought there were 151 Pokmon and this dude rocked up????
<GOOD> I need to keep playing MH when I feel better
<GOOD> I wanna draw Hala as Donphan now
<GOOD> GU
<GOOD> I just entered high rank in both hub and village
<GOOD> As in I did village then turbo'd through Hub
<GOOD> As I get pushed into higher Hub ranks maybe
<GOOD> I don't rlly wanna do too many Hub buffed monsters solo
<GOOD> It gets boring
<GOOD> I'm trying to learn uh
<GOOD> HBG atm but I might just go back to Horn anyway
<GOOD> Valor HBG feels weird
<GOOD> It's the Seregios one so free reloads tho wooooo
<GOOD> At least I built the cool Gunner Rathalos armour too
<GOOD> Should carry me far enough into HR if I wanna use Gunner
<GOOD> I have full Rathalos Blademaster armour too w Attack up L
<GOOD> I love decorations!!!
<GOOD> I basically only use GS for Aerial now
<GOOD> Because it's fun
<GOOD> Then Valor Horn is my main and I'm testing the waters w other weapons
<GOOD> Valor Horn is so evil I love it
<GOOD> I recently discovered the Valor Sheath can be delayed it's so cracked
<GOOD> And I went through all of Low Rank without finding this
<GOOD> Valor Horn is just what I was getting from Hammer but infinitely more fun
<GOOD> Bc like Hammer has such small range and the hits are more commital
<GOOD> Whereas with Horn I just whale on everything for free and make it tired as shit because I loop buffs
<GOOD> I just want to use Aerial for tails tbh
<GOOD> And bc ground charge gets interrupted so easily
<GOOD> The bug is cool but like I don't get it
<GOOD> *beetle
<GOOD> Lego is so expensive and for a low quality end product if it's a set compared to a real statue
<GOOD> This one is funny af
<GOOD> I hate being the fan of a character that is notorious for being killed it's funny and sad at the same time
<GOOD> Edgerunners makes me wanna try 2077
<GOOD> But I can only get the PS4 version rlly and it's probably still running like ass
<GOOD> I only play such survival games w friends for a few hours then get bored and stop
<GOOD> Unless it's DST which I'll play solo
<GOOD> My mom bought me my favourite sweets this is awesome
<GOOD> Well maybe my favourite
<GOOD> But market sweets are awesome
<GOOD> Mlem
<GOOD> Does anyone have any funny conspiracy sources/wikis/videos/rabbit holes to get lost down
<GOOD> I encountered this and I'm feeling tinfoil hat-y
<GOOD> Imma watch all of em together later when I'm bored
<GOOD> My brother keeps getting daily masculinity in his YouTube shorts
<GOOD> Damn shavers are expensive
<GOOD> When I get back to uni I'm buying a good shaver and an epilator and going through an agonising afternoon of ripping out arm hair (gonna be awesome)
<GOOD> Damn maybe I should be playing MH Now
<GOOD> Do you mean like TTS or actual AI
<GOOD> And if so is it that one voice from the if humans had tails short
<GOOD> I might but I already am in gacha hell
<GOOD> Must save myself
<GOOD> this fat fuck is called a tapir
This stupid bastard is the canadian goose
<GOOD> As bad as the AI Voices are watching them show emotion occasionally is so funny
<GOOD> Be more autistic is sending me
<GOOD> I wanna draw but no ideas
<GOOD> Why is it rubbing its fingers together
<GOOD> I've only drank like, bottles of cider on special occasions
<GOOD> Singular ones
<GOOD> And maybe a cocktail
<GOOD> I should get drunk more often........
<GOOD> I'd just be doing sad alone person drinking tho
<GOOD> So kinda boring
<GOOD> Ok but it's still escapism alone or with friends
<GOOD> Same just tipsy
<GOOD> I don't wanna be drunk in case I do stupid stuff
<GOOD> Although stuff like watermelon vodka is tempting sounding
<GOOD> Although it'll probably just taste like vodka instead of watermelon
<GOOD> I haven't hung out with anyone at all lol
<GOOD> Usually just helping people with revision and stuff if that counts, and that was months back
<GOOD> What's a support group
<GOOD> My uni's gaming society is fun and I'm glad it's tolerant, I am friends with a few ppl there I think
<GOOD> Although a lot of em I talk to more through its discord BC I can't make some socials
<GOOD> As it turns out being a Guilty Gear, Pokemon and Ace Attorney fan makes me well versed in meeting and talking to other queer ppl in the society
<GOOD> I think there are gimmick bars for it but yea that's about it
<GOOD> Uhhhh Geek Retreat was fun for scheduling meetups and I think they do open events sometimes
<GOOD> But I didn't do that BC I don't like strangers usually and I had a d&d party
<GOOD> I agree
<GOOD> It reminds me of chuck e cheese
<GOOD> Who goes w a purple and yellow colour scheme
<GOOD> Probably bc tabletop is an inherently more social aspect
<GOOD> There's a bar for gaming near me but it's expensive and I don't rlly like club vibes so
<GOOD> Packed places can be v annoying
<GOOD> Dw if you ever played d&d you'd naturally attract Pathfinder fans
<GOOD> They love talking about how much better Pathfinder is as a system to 5e fans
<GOOD> It probably is I haven't read it but it's like, everywhere for some reason
<GOOD> I'm saying it rn
<GOOD> I cleared my foundation year but next year is gonna ramp tf up
<GOOD> At least it's finally about the thing I actually love (feesh) so I can lock tf in
<GOOD> I barely scraped college because CS sucks
<GOOD> And I chose DT as well like damn I hated myself
<GOOD> I had Cs and 1 B in A levels
<GOOD> Barely scraped
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Also as it turns out taking courses you're disinterested in makes you much worse at them
<GOOD> I thought I'd like what I took but I only enjoyed Bio
<GOOD> So I crashed in the others (DT was free anyway tho)
<GOOD> Mine was in like my last year of GCSE
<GOOD> I didn't have any friends so I just spent most of the time sobbing lmao
<GOOD> I didn't miss any sessions tho
<GOOD> This chat is lowkey the only one I like in this server
<GOOD> I'm in here, a kirby server and a MH server when I'm playing it and that's about it
<GOOD> Brain usage or Gen Z angel that gives me mild eye strain....
<GOOD> I may chill and play Layton
<GOOD> I have generally raised to unlikeable status by a lot of ppl in this server so
<GOOD> Yes I am typically not liked lol, either by what I've done personally or as a mod
<GOOD> By people both in and out of the server
<GOOD> Most I'm alr with but some were mostly my fault
<GOOD> This makes me wanna draw things Layton style...
<GOOD> I love u Professor
<GOOD> Haiii
<GOOD> True it's made me wanna start a collection
<GOOD> Of something
<GOOD> Not sure what yet, maybe old books maybe a shrine for a media franchise I like
<GOOD> Pikmin shrine is tempting
<GOOD> Relatable
<GOOD> However all Pikmin merch has to be imported
<GOOD> Which sucks
<GOOD> My friend promised she'd get me a late birthday gift over a month ago
<GOOD> Actually this time last month was my birthday
<GOOD> You also made me want a CRT and a random console for some reason
<GOOD> Even though I have the space and means for neither of those
<GOOD> I honestly need to buy a bunch of stickers to decorate my belongings with
<GOOD> My friend did it to her laptop and I wanna do it to my tablet or phone or smth
<GOOD> I can't do this bc my parents will find out
<GOOD> Very sad
<GOOD> I wanna treat myself to smth
<GOOD> If only things were cheap instead of expensive
<GOOD> I wish I lived in japan so I had access to gachapon machines
<GOOD> Gambling my money away
<GOOD> Wait maybe I could start a Miku collection
<GOOD> He hard opened them
<GOOD> I have been feeling pretty fem recently even tho we aren't friends
<GOOD> I have only had a handful of conversations with you, you're chill and nice
<GOOD> But like I usually make it vocally clear when someone is a friend because I'm dumb and can't convey or understand it through vibe
<GOOD> No one is my friend until they call me their friend fr
<GOOD> Because before then I'm like but what if they don't fw me
<GOOD> Real
<GOOD> I suck at geography where is Venezuela
<GOOD> I own 20% of Venezuela
<GOOD> I got it in those Forbidden Planet blind boxes
<GOOD> I think altering armour is rlly weird
<GOOD> It's good but like it's quite weird
<GOOD> I kinda wanna buy an original XBOX does anyone have recs for games to get for it
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Imma watch it next week I think
<GOOD> My ear and throat hurts
<GOOD> So I'm resting again
<GOOD> I have been the past few days
<GOOD> The back of my neck?
<GOOD> Are we thinking of the same Vic
<GOOD> Idk if you mean Vick's then I have only ever put it on my chest
<GOOD> For some reason I only play 2 levels of Kid Icarus Uprising every day
<GOOD> No more no less
<GOOD> I have been but I suck at the game also
<GOOD> 15 ish
<GOOD> I think I just beat 15
<GOOD> He is actually so funny
<GOOD> I've only known Nividi(?) like 4 chapters and she's already awesome
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I like all the characters
<GOOD> Pit is funny when he tries to be cool
<GOOD> I just saw him threaten the lightning lady and get interrupted mid cutscene
<GOOD> Well fuck you too Professor
<GOOD> There gedner
<GOOD> My head hurts but we ball
<GOOD> I wish I was pretty and girly
<GOOD> Omfggggg everything does so much damage
<GOOD> This game is so annoying on higher difficulties
<GOOD> Like literally anything above 5 and you get absolutely obliterated
<GOOD> Or maybe I just suck ass at Kid Icarus Uprising
<GOOD> Also  I knew that pyro dude was bad news from like the second mission with him
<GOOD> I just did the ring mission
<GOOD> Fist
<GOOD> I switched from volcanic fist to the electro shock ons
<GOOD> It was mostly stats
<GOOD> But I dig this new electro one a lot bc of the range
<GOOD> Yes, a few actually
<GOOD> Like 5/6 things
<GOOD> I got Aries today
<GOOD> Fuse?
<GOOD> I didn't know I could do that
<GOOD> Yea probably
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> I've just been going raw
<GOOD> No wonder above 5 seemed pretty tough
<GOOD> I officially have fallen to advertising
<GOOD> This shit too funny to ignore
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Unedited fucking image
<GOOD> Discord is exploding rn
<GOOD> If the mrbeast image sends again it's not on ms
<GOOD> I live v close to Birmingham pls don't
<GOOD> It's ass
<GOOD> Has a lovely chinese area tho, never been to the pride village bc my dad is afraid of gay people
<GOOD> They call it that but it's just an area of the city dedicated to pride ig
<GOOD> Gay lottery
<GOOD> MHNow is fun
<GOOD> I'm North Wales only
<GOOD> When I'm back at least
<GOOD> Luigi Mansion
<GOOD> I did but I still suck
<GOOD> Although it does help
<GOOD> Not rlly the game is almost over
<GOOD> And I'm dying to cheap shots still because everything does a ton
<GOOD> 5
<GOOD> Then I get knocked down to 4 because I lose once
<GOOD> It's literally just 5/8
<GOOD> 9
<GOOD> Yes why
<GOOD> Telling because I fucking suck at even that
<GOOD> I guess
<GOOD> 2/9 just feels so impossibly low tho
<GOOD> I feel so immersed rn
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Need the long neck plush
<GOOD> Me I need to gamble on the gachapon machines
<GOOD> Miiverse
<GOOD> Can this dude fuck off
<GOOD> It's my first day
<GOOD> MHNow encourages me to try old gen Gunlance
<GOOD> And suck at it probably
<GOOD> I think mine would be worse ngl
<GOOD> Ngl always expect horrible advice when asking a public forum
<GOOD> Yeah a friend group usually tho
<GOOD> Or like a trusted circle
<GOOD> I think this server is like an meeting room where literally anyone can walk in and give advice
<GOOD> Like people hang out here, but everyone is welcome
<GOOD> Like a bar
<GOOD> Happy Chaos.....
<GOOD> He makes me Sad Chaos
<GOOD> I don't lol
<GOOD> Anyway yippee MHNow is silly I beat a black diablos hitless
<GOOD> Also makes me wanna try Gunlance
<GOOD> Even tho I know Gunlance in GU is too much for me
<GOOD> And feels ass compared to Horn
<GOOD> Adept SnS in GU is so easy
<GOOD> I stopped using it
<GOOD> Like you have so little time between attack and ability to dodge that you can just brain off mash
<GOOD> And then dodge when the mood strikes you and do even more damage
<GOOD> Even in the absolutely worst case you can just block
<GOOD> My brother put on some random grifter investigator guy on yt and I need to stop almost laughing at this landlord losing money on his expensive ass house
<GOOD> His 3rd house
<GOOD> I love trans chat
<GOOD> Pre timeskip Rodrick
<GOOD> I think trans people should beat up my dad
<GOOD> Because he's spouting shit again
<GOOD> Nothing would
<GOOD> Bro is talking about how oppressed he is rn
<GOOD> And dropping slurs, then when I corrected him on transphobic misinformation he immediately backpedaled and said he didn't know what intersex meant
<GOOD> The dude just don't know what he's yapping about
<GOOD> He called Britain the most tolerant country on Earth
<GOOD> Tolerant until anyone from the southern hemisphere
<GOOD> Or gay or trans or hasn't been here since the reign of Henry the 8h
<GOOD> But yea idc if he likes trans ppl anymore he's too far gone
<GOOD> There are people who are ignorant but he's just hateful
<GOOD> He won't stop talking about that horrific stabbing yesterday too
<GOOD> None of mine are
<GOOD> Tolerant UK mfs when anyone is Romanian
<GOOD> Can I move there
<GOOD> Best bet is that my mom's love is actually unconditional
<GOOD> My brother is picking up this shite too
<GOOD> My dad was complaining earlier that the media is censoring right wingers like the entire election wasn't the literal worst politician on the news
<GOOD> But I'm not gonna dive into that here BC yes
<GOOD> Yeah it's just awful everywhere
<GOOD> His party is so small too like lmao
<GOOD> Literally my dad
<GOOD> Bro is making a child murder about race rn
<GOOD> The dude is literally a British citizen since birth shut up
<GOOD> They're from Rwanda
<GOOD> But yeah it's just yap
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Please
<GOOD> I hate Birmingham
<GOOD> Tbf my information is on that is from my dad
<GOOD> So could be false I'm trying to stay off Twitter for mental
<GOOD> But with your average median blue check Twitter user in my house it's not exactly working
<GOOD> True but my dad acts the same way because he doesn't know shit lol
<GOOD> I don't but the algorithm sucks
<GOOD> And everything has to be a trans issue
<GOOD> I said I'm taking a break
<GOOD> But as I said they're being brought to me irl
<GOOD> Ok just checking but Germany has a far right government rn right
<GOOD> Bro is saying the police are more aggressive against white people now
<GOOD> Kms bro I can't stand this house
<GOOD> I have a month and a half left
<GOOD> Yippee how fun
<GOOD> I wanna use Tumblr more
<GOOD> Feesh
<GOOD> Sure i need a reason lol
<GOOD> I despise this heat
<GOOD> Moving to a cold place ASAP
<GOOD> Goblin deez shark
<GOOD> That's part of it
<GOOD> I read about wet bulb and now I have an existential fear
<GOOD> Also we don't have fans running
<GOOD> Because eventually we will reach a point of heat and humidity where vaporisation of sweat isn't possible
<GOOD> So without AC we can't cool down and we die
<GOOD> And I'm not a fan of the concept of being boiled in my own skin
<GOOD> I like basking sharks
<GOOD> I'm 19
<GOOD> I'm 19
<GOOD> Pessimistically I live for like 60 more years and then what
<GOOD> I went there today
<GOOD> I love the video
<GOOD> Pop go
<GOOD> Same bc england is shiy
<GOOD> I wish I was welsh
<GOOD> It's such a peaceful place
<GOOD> Kinda
<GOOD> How big is the SD card
<GOOD> I only have 64 very sad
<GOOD> How do u replace the nub
<GOOD> Wait wtf
<GOOD> That's so easy
<GOOD> I'm not gonna do it imma just buy a circle pad pro instead
<GOOD> But it's still cool
<GOOD> Oh shit
<GOOD> It's not brand new no
<GOOD> I just wanted a circle pad pro because the c stick is mid lol
<GOOD> And Monster Hunter is a bit more demanding
<GOOD> Does the one for the regular XL Not work?
<GOOD> Ah ok
<GOOD> Unfortunate
<GOOD> Ao Oning out rn
<GOOD> Oh pleaaaaase let me go home soon
<GOOD> I hate England
<GOOD> Plesioth fucking sucks wth
<GOOD> Why does it do so much damage
<GOOD> Guess I'm playing DBD
<GOOD> I love Rurouni Kenshin
<GOOD> Anime about a wandering swordsman with a blade that can't cut
<GOOD> It's blunt on the outside
<GOOD> And sharp on the inside
<GOOD> He was a manslayer before, the sword is sharp on the inside curve so he has to contemplate the weight of killing if he wants to do it again
<GOOD> Holding it backwards is acknowledging the life you're taking by doing so
<GOOD> The new one was good so far
<GOOD> He's knowledgeable enough not to
<GOOD> He's like batman he injures but doesn't kill
<GOOD> Like he breaks people's hand tendons so they can't use a sword again but doesn't kill
<GOOD> Damn and he's the GOAT too
<GOOD> Maybe I should try and get a PS2 to play RE and Silent Hill
<GOOD> I don't think I can afford the remakes
<GOOD> Idk haven't checked
<GOOD> Maybe more expensive than I thought idk I'm going to bed
<GOOD> I just really like Pyramid Head thh
<GOOD> Fixing gen 2!!!!
<GOOD> God pyramid head looks cool
<GOOD> Wdym the Ledian
<GOOD> Wdym by that, pray tell
<GOOD> TAKE IT BACK
<GOOD> Try tied for top 1
<GOOD> Can't even use peak when it's right in front of them....
<GOOD> It also has baton pass and stuff later on
<GOOD> And surprising spdef
<GOOD> All available in early game
<GOOD> On the topic of allegations, the Fortnite leak community is phrasing a doc about one of their leakers as a leak
<GOOD> I think the biggest possible recipients of blowback from this is Oneyplays and Sr Pelo
<GOOD> Idk that person their name rings a bell tho
<GOOD> Isn't psychicpebbles zach
<GOOD> Zach is Oneyplays
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Or part of it
<GOOD> I only know Oneyplays from 3lamestudio
<GOOD> And smiling friends
<GOOD> I love peaklamestudio
<GOOD> Seeing Bart literally ever just reminds me of the video of him walking around the house
<GOOD> Usually with the caption saying something about Persona 1
<GOOD> My favourite 3lame video is probably the no Peter, we're in Doki Doki Literature Club clip
<GOOD> Oh my god everything is doing so much damage
<GOOD> I know it's scaled for 2 people but what the fuck
<GOOD> I need to hunt high rank Mizutsune and Rathalos so many times imna kill someone
<GOOD> I'm playing GU ye
<GOOD> We can if you wanna
<GOOD> At some point at least
<GOOD> My GOAT stays unwashed
<GOOD> MY GOAT
<GOOD> Also I think that's meant to be Friendpool or whatever
<GOOD> Thing, japan....
<GOOD> My aunt knows what I fw
<GOOD> High rank Hub killing me
<GOOD> I gotta grind sm
<GOOD> FUCK I NEED IT
<GOOD> I finished kid icarus
<GOOD> It's almost midnight so maybe tomorrow
<GOOD> Remind me if u can
<GOOD> Viridi
<GOOD> Hades then Pit 2nd and 3rd
<GOOD> I need to find someone to carry me in GU tomorrow
<GOOD> I just spammed flash pods in world
<GOOD> I may not upgrade to next gen for it
<GOOD> FNAF 10TH BIRTHDAY
<GOOD> Ohhhhh my god
<GOOD> Need
<GOOD> True :((
<GOOD> I just got some bubble tea with whipped cream on top
<GOOD> I need to grind again in MH
<GOOD> This is very sad
<GOOD> I've beaten Kid Icarus Uprising idk what game to play now
<GOOD> Yayyyy the Horn looks gud
<GOOD> I've been to Southport before it was lovely
<GOOD> Me and my nan used to go to Warwick Castle a lot
<GOOD> Lovely person
<GOOD> So like
<GOOD> I heard Sonic Generations has mods
<GOOD> Good mods
<GOOD> It's the second one it looks better I think
<GOOD> So I should buy it lmao I need to play Unleashed
<GOOD> I played it on Wii and got stuck on the first Werehog level as a kid because I suvk
<GOOD> Suck
<GOOD> Yea I heard smth like that
<GOOD> Do you recommend the Unleashed Project tho, assuming I just wanna play the levels featured
<GOOD> Or should I try and emulate
<GOOD> (I'm googling rn)
<GOOD> Okie
<GOOD> Are there other recommended mods to try for Gens because that seems kinda crazy lmao
<GOOD> I think they didn't want the night levels lmao
<GOOD> But tbh I like the Werehog
<GOOD> 06?
<GOOD> That's awesome
<GOOD> How the Boost era of Sonic RUINED exploration... (Part 1) [1:36:24]
<GOOD> I used to play Rush Adventure DS iirc
<GOOD> The one with the boats
<GOOD> It was fun
<GOOD> Chat I'm at a rock festival and I'm the only person in a Hawaiian shirt
<GOOD> Most other people are in black help
<GOOD> Woahg the festival was awesome
<GOOD> Idk how Picross works
<GOOD> Unironically more excited for the beaver movie than any sequel they revealed
<GOOD> Mr Incredible fortnite
<GOOD> I have dogs instead of cats
<GOOD> Pepper
<GOOD> It's mostly because she's all black and has flecks of hazel on them so she looks seasoned
<GOOD> (the white parts came after because she's old)
<GOOD> Ancient ass dog
<GOOD> I'm trying to draw
<GOOD> An OC probably
<GOOD> I need to hunt in GU actually today
<GOOD> Idk whether to go for the Astalos or Nargacuga HH tho
<GOOD> I gotta get to HR7 to fight 3 Rathians and make HR Rath armour
<GOOD> Tenderiser
<GOOD> What's the last one
<GOOD> Yeah but like, that would be 99
<GOOD> Ohhh
<GOOD> I forgot Steam had plats
<GOOD> I meant like an all achievements achievement usually
<GOOD> Ugh I don't wanna play MHGU but I need to
<GOOD> Yes I must get to G rank
<GOOD> But my head hurts so idk
<GOOD> I only have 2 ranks left but Hub is so annoying solo
<GOOD> Because every hunt takes twice as long lol
<GOOD> The other hunts are a fun length
<GOOD> Hub is just a battle of attrition but solo they're just a bit lame
<GOOD> I haven't started and won't for like a decade teehee
<GOOD> Mh
<GOOD> Hopefully
<GOOD> Chat what colours
<GOOD> I'm thinking ginger hair but idk what colours
<GOOD> I ended up with uh
<GOOD> This, WIP for the shoes and patches but I like the colours for the robe
<GOOD> I like it
<GOOD> No it's my cart
<GOOD> I also bought Sonic Generations
<GOOD> Wow Borderlands was terrible
<GOOD> I was thinking oh this is gonna be sooooo funny bad
<GOOD> It wasn't
<GOOD> It was truly a nonsensical, bland adventure movie
<GOOD> It felt like one of those American psycho 2 situations where they wrote the script first and then was like hey why not make this Borderlands? Then made the set and props and costumes
<GOOD> Seltas Queen is my new favourite monster
<GOOD> Oh I've seen that Gus gif
<GOOD> I play Snake and Wario usually
<GOOD> Banjo feels shit
<GOOD> I want to like them but they truly feel awful
<GOOD> Maybe I'll try Mega Man
<GOOD> I wanna try Mega Man but he seems funky
<GOOD> He's just doing his job
<GOOD> Olimar is so cool he's in my still incomplete favourites chart
<GOOD> He's number 4 which is honestly p good
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I do but not as much as most of these fellas
<GOOD> The fact that Birdo is like her deadname or smth according to the OG guide is rlly sad
<GOOD> I assume they just retconned it but whatever
<GOOD> Her name is Birdetta yea
<GOOD> But like idk what Nintendo's deal was making fun of her
<GOOD> I need to play her in MK8 since I'm fairly sure she shares a weight class with Yoshi
<GOOD> Who is ofc the best character
<GOOD> Need to learn the ways of the sweat build
<GOOD> I already use a pretty strong combo tbh
<GOOD> But in MK8 most builds that aren't meta actively feel worse to use so like
<GOOD> It's not like other games where non meta things pop off or feel awesome so you use them
<GOOD> Once you take the roller wheel pill you can't go back
<GOOD> I haven't seen leaf in ages
<GOOD> Roller is just that busted
<GOOD> Azure rollers are my comfort wheels for when I get tired of rollers
<GOOD> My build is usually inkling, scooty, rollers, cloud glider
<GOOD> It feels good
<GOOD> And I usually pop off w it
<GOOD> I can't choose bad builds anymore
<GOOD> It feels horrible
<GOOD> I can't control them but I will choose worse builds against worse ppl
<GOOD> Oh I see
<GOOD> I couldn't see that koopa for the life of me
<GOOD> Nah I've seen it before
<GOOD> Bombs are actually super free to hit people with
<GOOD> Because they're programmed to blow up when you're near them not on a timer usually
<GOOD> It's funny tho
<GOOD> I got too into comp mario kart
<GOOD> I'm not good at it but I understand it usually
<GOOD> Bagging got nerfed there's no real reason to complain about it anymore
<GOOD> Even on hard bag tracks you're mostly fishing for coins by dropping down to low positions on the first lap
<GOOD> Plus running some tracks can actually be ok depending on who is bagging and how many, although on stuff like cheese land you straight up shouldn't because shocks are so devastating and the cuts are insane
<GOOD> Especially because a lot of the track doesn't have glider so it's kinda hard to keep your lead
<GOOD> Although Cheese Land is obviously the best bagging track in the game so shouldn't rlly be used as that metric
<GOOD> But Mario Circuit also has that same kinda thing since no glider and lots of freeeee cuts, with basically no benefit to running
<GOOD> Running is a playstyle as valid as bagging, there's a time for both
<GOOD> Yerp
<GOOD> Arguably the best
<GOOD> For bagging
<GOOD> I think Mario Circuit has a chance too
<GOOD> But at least that has the technical execution of the grass cut
<GOOD> All bagging has technical execution but like the grass cut is tough
<GOOD> Cheese Land has the bullet extension but that's just recognising where to use it
<GOOD> (I don't fully remember where to use the cheese land bullet extension)
<GOOD> I believe it's inside the first arch offroad
<GOOD> I remember
<GOOD> But bagging truly isn't dead
<GOOD> You just have to soft bag now
<GOOD> Respawns aren't viable at all rlly it's not good to lose coins
<GOOD> Bagging is primarily for early coins and preserving them, then staying a moderate distance while cycling items to slowly make up the distance
<GOOD> Usually in the final lap is where everyone makes an effort to catch up
<GOOD> Coins are the most important aspect of bagging easily, as well as shroom cuts
<GOOD> You can apply that to most games tho
<GOOD> I did that w friends
<GOOD> Especially speedrunning
<GOOD> But Mario Kart has a kinda unique balance of RNG and skill
<GOOD> Because usually most of the shit that happens to you is your own fault or salvageable
<GOOD> That's probably why the VR system exists
<GOOD> It's like saying the same about Smash or smth
<GOOD> I go based on feel for Tour
<GOOD> Mario Party is significantly more reliant on just complete bullshit tbf lol
<GOOD> There's no way to prevent things happening to you usually
<GOOD> In Mario Kart a suprising amount goes into being first
<GOOD> Namely being second
<GOOD> Nah I'm saying being in second in running tracks is optimal
<GOOD> Shocks have less effect and blues are on their shoulders instead, plus you can smuggle shrooms into first when that inevitably happens
<GOOD> Which is blue protection
<GOOD> Smuggling a mushroom into first is your objective always
<GOOD> It's so insanely good
<GOOD> Then they're losing an insane amount of time to rely on laggy ass blue shell tracking
<GOOD> And the person in second place, probably with a shroom, can dodge the blue
<GOOD> Slowing down to dodge a blue is rarely the way to go
<GOOD> They'll probably drop down further than second if they're coming to a complete stop
<GOOD> High level rooms are very dense
<GOOD> Snaking works for everyone
<GOOD> It's optimal on dry bones tho
<GOOD> Idk man I just like talking about comp mario kart
<GOOD> Idc if it's sweaty it's interesting to see how a game with so much RNG fosters a competitive environment
<GOOD> And how much of that RNG can be minimised
<GOOD> this was a fun video to see the optimisations on
<GOOD> He also has a beginner guide
<GOOD> Anyway gn chat I love talking about comp Mario Kart
<GOOD> Mirrored stuff always looks weird ngl
<GOOD> Like I saw someone flip a fnaf cam render around and it looks so wrong
<GOOD> Just fundamentally
<GOOD> No but like
<GOOD> Yes I loved the fnaf movie
<GOOD> Idk what you're talking about
<GOOD> I would have preferred them to have the pin light eyes from the games
<GOOD> In its current state yes
<GOOD> Does she know
<GOOD> Unbeknownst to a lot of ppl here fnaf is like, my biggest interest
<GOOD> Always has been for over 10 years I watch it almost every day
<GOOD> It's like a severe fixation
<GOOD> One moment
<GOOD> Subject to change ofc
<GOOD> They are in order
<GOOD> Except Fruit Punch Clown he is a joke
<GOOD> I don't own SB it's too expensive
<GOOD> And you can gain almost the same experience by watching it
<GOOD> It's a pretty terrible game all things considered but the designs fuck and I like it
<GOOD> Oh also I don't remember if The Mimic is in here but it's high S
<GOOD> Probably just below Glitchtrap/Malhare
<GOOD> Godddd it's 1 30
<GOOD> But I wanna talk about fnaf
<GOOD> Also fangame designs aren't here but there are some I would put in S+ easy
<GOOD> But I wanna talk fnaf :(((
<GOOD> I don't get to very often bc no one asks
<GOOD> Oki...
<GOOD> LIKE MONSTER RAT AND POPGOES THE WEASEL AND FNAF BLOODY NIGHTS SPRINGBONNIE
<GOOD> We're way past that but I'll still explain it byeeeee
<GOOD> Oh wow I talked a lot about mario kart
<GOOD> I didn't even remember
<GOOD> Yeah Chiitan is the GOAT
<GOOD> I like Yuri tho.......
<GOOD> I finished grinding for rathalos gear yesterday so I can finally get to HR 7 in GU today
<GOOD> And hunt Rajang and fight Seregios for upgrades to my weapon
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Yes?
<GOOD> She's possessed by Elizabeth, her name is Circus Baby
<GOOD> Yea this is the death minigame
<GOOD> Notably Baby has blue eyes in this death minigame and her eyes are green in game
<GOOD> Ennard is a conglomeration of other animatronics
<GOOD> It's every Funtime animatronic in 1
<GOOD> And they scoop and infest Michael Afton so they could leave the facility
<GOOD> They didn't for a while
<GOOD> Some of these mfs still in the crib
<GOOD> I don't think you can send this
<GOOD> I was referencing it but it has the N word in it
<GOOD> It is my favourite fnaf related video tho
<GOOD> I lose my shit whenever I see the scene now
<GOOD> Ayyyy Mikey
<GOOD> STUCK INSIDE???? FNAF REFERENCE???
<GOOD> Surprisingly he's still very much alive
<GOOD> Michael that is
<GOOD> Well Ennard is too
<GOOD> He's most likely alive through his own remnant or smth
<GOOD> Most likely he isn't connected to the same network that Burntrap infected the others through
<GOOD> Because of his stage error
<GOOD> SB lore gets a little shaky because Scott didn't oversee it or tell Steel Wool things
<GOOD> It does but I like it
<GOOD> Scott didn't tell Steel Wool any of the lore for base SB
<GOOD> He just said he wanted Burntrap in the game, but didn't tell them anything so he became the villain instead of just a hallucination like he's meant to be
<GOOD> I think that has huge potential for fnaf going forwards if they make it good
<GOOD> Just look at The Glitched Attraction
<GOOD> It's not free roam but it's 3D
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> He handed it off to steel wool and makes spinoffs in his spare time when he feels like it
<GOOD> Like Freddy in Space
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Killing Scott Cawthon usually
<GOOD> Same as TJOC
<GOOD> I think maybe a more goal oriented 3D survival game would work
<GOOD> Free roam puts more strain on the Devs and makes for a less clean experience
<GOOD> Fresident Evil
<GOOD> Their souls are tied to the suits
<GOOD> The suits are on a free roaming mode sometimes or just happen to like walking around
<GOOD> The animatronics would get caught if they left, some of them don't want to leave
<GOOD> Some of them do leave like in fnaf 6
<GOOD> In that game Baby, Ennard, The Puppet and Springtrap all sneak in
<GOOD> We don't see like, any daytime gameplay but presumably it's only when they aren't on like, a script
<GOOD> When they aren't performing they're roaming
<GOOD> Although tbh possessed animatronics that can actually get to the player of their own free will without being impeded somehow are only a thing in fnaf 1 in the first few games
<GOOD> In sister location you're being used the entire time so
<GOOD> I mean I guess Pizza Sim does that
<GOOD> But basically none of the animatronics you can buy are possessed
<GOOD> And the ones that are try and jump you while you're in your office
<GOOD> Iirc the only possessed animatronic you can buy is Lefty
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> The puppet is inside Lefty
<GOOD> No she's sneaking inside the building
<GOOD> Presumably to protect children
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> She isn't sealed inside Lefty she just used it to move around
<GOOD> You can't really salvage the puppet after all
<GOOD> She could be like, mildly trapped but not properly at all
<GOOD> Oh ok nvm
<GOOD> I wasn't aware of this but Henry (presumably) used Lefty to trap the Puppet and bring it to the location
<GOOD> Where it could be burned
<GOOD> Fanf
<GOOD> Because it's the most dynamic one
<GOOD> The rest don't capture the funniness of this
<GOOD> It's real
<GOOD> Ultimate Custom Night smh
<GOOD> 50 animatronics in 1 office
<GOOD> Michael didn't kill anyone I don't think
<GOOD> Golden Freddy is Cassidy tho
<GOOD> I don't recall the crying child possessing anyone
<GOOD> Yds
<GOOD> It was NOT the bite of 87
<GOOD> They weren't the same place
<GOOD> The bite of 83 happens under Henry and Afton most likely, then the bite of 87 is at Henry's establishment
<GOOD> Unless I'm remembering wrong and Fredbear was created under Afton's direction which caused Henry and him to split
<GOOD> He's the guy that orchestrates the fire in fnaf 6 most likely
<GOOD> He's Charlotte's father
<GOOD> And Charlotte is the girl Afton kills in the fnaf 2 death minigame
<GOOD> The original souls are freed in 3
<GOOD> Happiest Day is canon I think
<GOOD> Although for some reason the Puppet sticks around
<GOOD> Gets trapped inside Lefty and burned
<GOOD> It's book timeline and game timeline
<GOOD> And they have overlap
<GOOD> You are michael in fnaf 2, no?
<GOOD> It's a theory actually nvm
<GOOD> Michael is MOST LIKELY Jeremy
<GOOD> Just under a fake name
<GOOD> Because the book timeline establishes much weirder things
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It has parallels that confirm things between the games
<GOOD> Like remnant and stuff
<GOOD> And it recently became a lot more important with THE MIMIC
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> In fact the mimic is very important in the books
<GOOD> It was set up for a while
<GOOD> Not that we know
<GOOD> He returned twice in canon
<GOOD> 3 times if we count glitchtrap
<GOOD> Glitchtrap technically isn't tho
<GOOD> Well not technically he isn't
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> It's the mimic program
<GOOD> I forgot that for a sec I was about to mention the remnant circuit board theory
<GOOD> That one's outdated tho
<GOOD> Some dude in the book lol
<GOOD> We don't know who made it in the games yet
<GOOD> Because it's old as fuck
<GOOD> That's why I'm saying the books are important
<GOOD> Because it has details that cross over with in universe equivalents
<GOOD> Technically Henry in the games isn't Henry, he's cassette man
<GOOD> Yeah that's why the next game is called Secrets of the Mimic
<GOOD> We gonna learn Mimic lore
<GOOD> Afton technically hasn't been involved since UCN
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Mimic is before anything we know of in the timeline
<GOOD> It presumably was at Fallfest
<GOOD> Which was in the 70s
<GOOD> The Mimic is its own thing
<GOOD> It mimics whatever
<GOOD> It just happened to mimic Afton
<GOOD> We don't know why it was made yet
<GOOD> Yeah for sure lmao
<GOOD> Whenever I think of the endoskeleton in the books I think of the suicide robot Henry built with the giant fucking knife
<GOOD> OMG GUYS THE MIMIC???
<GOOD> The comic of the books is so bad
<GOOD> I can say that bc the artists were creeps
<GOOD> The art is horrendous
<GOOD> Same artist drew this Afton
<GOOD> There's another panel where he's like, sitting at a table
<GOOD> But BC he's fat she couldn't draw him sitting under it and she bends the table leg to fit him
<GOOD> It's so funny
<GOOD> William afton looking like this is so funny
<GOOD> This is the actual book design too lmao no non canon comics
<GOOD> He looks so bad
<GOOD> Pinkypills sucks
<GOOD> She's yucky
<GOOD> The person that drew it was a super creep that Scott fired a bit ago
<GOOD> So at least we hopefully won't see more of her art
<GOOD> His springbonnie suit
<GOOD> It's so cracked in GU tho
<GOOD> Or Yellow Rabbit if you really wanna call it that
<GOOD> Does Applebees serve apple pies
<GOOD> Swaxe is so busted
<GOOD> Like genuinely I'm having a blast splitting between Swaxe and HH rn
<GOOD> Lance occasionally
<GOOD> I barely understand how to use GL
<GOOD> In GU it's rlly shit lmao
<GOOD> It feels horrid
<GOOD> Yeah I went in w the wrong impression
<GOOD> Striker Lance is just so broken
<GOOD> Although then again Striker Swaxe is even more busted
<GOOD> You can keep Demon Riot going literally forever
<GOOD> Swaxe also severs tails stupid fast
<GOOD> Because you just mash X and win
<GOOD> HH in GU is so funny
<GOOD> Guild HH with both Absolute arts and then you spam X and A
<GOOD> Then occasionally do songs
<GOOD> Guild takes away your infinite
<GOOD> *Valor
<GOOD> Valor takes away your infinite
<GOOD> It literally takes away the X, A, X, A exhaustion loop
<GOOD> Try it then
<GOOD> And what does the X A combo do
<GOOD> I mean idk why you can't take my word for it
<GOOD> Valor replaces the A input after X with a hilt smack instead of a left swing
<GOOD> What input list do u want
<GOOD> What the fuck
<GOOD> Mine always did the stupid hilt strike thing
<GOOD> Ok that makes more sense
<GOOD> Either way I like using it all the time and Valor recitals didn't feel insane
<GOOD> So I just used Guild
<GOOD> Especially because you get to use both Absolute arts
<GOOD> I just don't enjoy valor that much on most weapons
<GOOD> I thought I did but then realised Absolute Readiness is broken and exactly what I want
<GOOD> What the fuck is a whetstone raaaaaaaa
<GOOD> I played it today but I literally killed Agnaktor and that was it
<GOOD> Because I didn't have time for Glavenus
<GOOD> It was like half fun half miserable
<GOOD> Aerial Hammer is always funny
<GOOD> Ok hm
<GOOD> Just roll a random style and random weapon tbh
<GOOD> Also I get to fight Rajang tomorrow
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> I keep forgetting Prowler exists
<GOOD> I never wanna play as it I don't think
<GOOD> Is Gens on 3DS I forgot
<GOOD> I might at some point but idk I'm not too buzzed about Prowler
<GOOD> I'll probably go forward to rush World and start Iceborne, then do Rise and Sunbreak, then go backwards from GU after that
<GOOD> Or Rise first idk
<GOOD> That's funny
<GOOD> Kinda sucks I can't use my childhood World save bc PC but at least Defender armour lets me stomp base World quick
<GOOD> Isn't that 4U
<GOOD> I thought GU was Switch only
<GOOD> Then Gens was 3DS
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Ohhhh
<GOOD> Yeah then I don't think I will
<GOOD> I'm bad enough at regular MH let alone Japanese MH
<GOOD> Can't read that I'm gonna keep chugging the wrong items
<GOOD> The amount of times I've almost taken demondrug instead of hot drink is crazy
<GOOD> Also like I'm probably just gonna play 4U and 3U instead
<GOOD> What is Dos and Tri btw
<GOOD> Is Tri just 3
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> So 3U is TriU
<GOOD> What console is Dos on, PS2?
<GOOD> Is Tri the water combat one
<GOOD> My friend tells me Tri has shit water combat and medium bowgun I think
<GOOD> But he hasn't played it so
<GOOD> Exactly tbh
<GOOD> Water combat in a Wii game seemed harrowing tho
<GOOD> Because I was imagining like, you point the wii mote to decide ur direction
<GOOD> I need to get a PS2 to play 1 and Dos fr
<GOOD> I was gonna try like, RE or Silent Hill but tbh I'll just emulate all of these
<GOOD> Or get a Vita and hack that at some point to play Freedom Unite
<GOOD> Although idk what the deal with Freedom is
<GOOD> Are they ports or smth?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> It looks so different
<GOOD> Monster Hunter's first step into 3D....
<GOOD> Waow
<GOOD> Strange
<GOOD> Also is Rajang like, big because I keep seeing pictures of Rajang looking much smaller than World makes him look
<GOOD> I haven't seen it in GU yet
<GOOD> I fucking hope it isn't small I hate small monsters
<GOOD> Blangonga had me tweaking tbh
<GOOD> Annoying ass
<GOOD> I may just suck at GU
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Actually that's what sparked my interest in other horror series recently
<GOOD> Like Silent Hill and RE
<GOOD> I want to bc Pyramid Head is cool
<GOOD> Which are the good ones and how
<GOOD> Ok ig I'll emulate them at some point
<GOOD> But rn I just keep monster hunting
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> That makes more sense
<GOOD> I can't run Ryujinx probably
<GOOD> It's debatable if imma be able to run World/Rise
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Also Seltas Queen is my favourite monster now
<GOOD> I haven't fought a Narscylla yet
<GOOD> I watched this today
<GOOD> It was funny
<GOOD> That isn't Freedom Unite
<GOOD> At least afaik I think it was Dos
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Do they have a cool monster
<GOOD> I like horror games with cool monsters
<GOOD> It's why that one in a mental hospital didn't interest me much
<GOOD> I forgot the name
<GOOD> A fair amount
<GOOD> Where are the goblins
<GOOD> Or the ghouls
<GOOD> Fatal Frame sounds like a boomer shooter from the 360 era tbh
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> The monsters in that game are just dudes
<GOOD> I like Pyramid Head like a lot
<GOOD> He's rlly cool
<GOOD> Sephiroth is scary but not that scary
<GOOD> There's an outlast 3
<GOOD> But it's not called that so
<GOOD> Outlast Trials is a 3rd game
<GOOD> I think it's multiplayer
<GOOD> That would make fnaf 2......
<GOOD> L l l l
<GOOD> Lost media....?
<GOOD> Found media...?
<GOOD> What animatronics could they poorly adapt in 2
<GOOD> Kill on sight
<GOOD> Also nvm if they fuck up Mangle's presentation I riot
<GOOD> They're so cool
<GOOD> Also holy fuck Into the Pit has the most Springbonnie fanservice ever I'm tweaking
<GOOD> My second favourite animatronic I love them
<GOOD> I forgot this was even a thing that's hilarious
<GOOD> Foxy is not edited here
<GOOD> My favourite is
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> I find Springtrap fun because he's intelligent
<GOOD> Just being held back by his suit
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Because Springtrap is RNG
<GOOD> He can kill you instantly with bad RNG
<GOOD> None of the other games have this be the case
<GOOD> Yeah but significantly less
<GOOD> Because all that is is blackout duration
<GOOD> Springtrap can straight up pass a bunch of checks, ignore your audio lure and kill you with no chance to defend yourself
<GOOD> He's the only RNG factor in 10/20 most of the time
<GOOD> He's coded bad because he's the only animatronic and has to be difficult
<GOOD> It doesn't happen often he's just very RNG heavy
<GOOD> Aggressive Nightmare is the only time it becomes a huge issue for Springtrap
<GOOD> They already made Fury's Rage
<GOOD> Close enough
<GOOD> It's a spinoff
<GOOD> Streets of rage parody game
<GOOD> Scott made it in the time leading up to SB because delays
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I love the fangames tbh
<GOOD> It's my biggest interest rn
<GOOD> I think it's most of the future of fnaf, and has been there since the start
<GOOD> They just get better and better
<GOOD> 1. Bite at Freddy's
Tied 1: Joy of Creation OG
3: Popgoes (ik it's kinda ass but nostalgiaaa)
4: Jr's
5: FNAC 3 even tho the mechanics kinda lame
<GOOD> Also shout-out to Those Nights at Rachel's for existing
<GOOD> It was p cool when it came out
<GOOD> Actually fnaf bloody nights may go between JOC and Popgoes
<GOOD> Bloody Nights is rlly good
<GOOD> It's rlly cool
<GOOD> Very well animated and good designs
<GOOD> I wish fnac 1 remastered fixed the power thing
<GOOD> I meant in regards to fnaf
<GOOD> But MH DJ has taken over there ye
<GOOD> It's rlly funny how every fnac game has a glaring issue that didn't get fixed
<GOOD> In fnac 2's case it has like 4
<GOOD> Mario RPG wasn't an era, Pikmin is still my favourite franchise of all time (or tied with fnaf idk)
<GOOD> And I'm still chipping away at Kirby
<GOOD> Also yes that's how fixations work dipper
<GOOD> I wish I could focus on 1 interest but I just can't
<GOOD> I just have to switch constantly and stuff
<GOOD> Never been able to play something for an extended period
<GOOD> Oh fnaf is permanent
<GOOD> I watch it almost every day and have for 10 years now
<GOOD> Whether it was animations, how to make it not scary, ppl playing it, etcetc
<GOOD> Yeah but it's annoying when I physically can't focus on what I want
<GOOD> It did a bit but that's on my end
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I would prefer to finish them
<GOOD> I played like 7 Kirby games in a few days lmao that one was wild
<GOOD> Maybe more
<GOOD> I'm not even diagnosed lol
<GOOD> So no idea if I even have anything going on
<GOOD> It seems likely tbh
<GOOD> Fuuuuck I suck at this game
<GOOD> I need to do that
<GOOD> I wanted Tropical Freeze a while ago
<GOOD> As a kid I beat DKC returns and Jungle Beat
<GOOD> I love DK as a franchise
<GOOD> I have it injected into my 3DS ready to play :3
<GOOD> I'm deciding what to play rn
<GOOD> I'm playing YKW and Layton
<GOOD> I got to the sky island area but then just like, stopped
<GOOD> I was loving it but I got mildly lost and forgot to go back
<GOOD> I do wanna try the 3D classics port
<GOOD> It adds backgrounds and stuff
<GOOD> Way ahead of u
<GOOD> I played Zero Mission and am a bit through Prime Remastered
<GOOD> It's p good it's nothing insane so far
<GOOD> I def prefer 2D
<GOOD> Also I beat Fusion but got most of the way into Zero Mission and got stuck lmao
<GOOD> Didn't know where to go
<GOOD> I also wanna try OoT/MM 3D
<GOOD> Yeah but p far down
<GOOD> I gotta do super Metroid first
<GOOD> Not recently
<GOOD> Nothing to do in them anymore
<GOOD> I did a ribbon master and don't like the other facilities in the battle frontier
<GOOD> So uh lmao
<GOOD> Kinda wild how my opinion of games changed when I stopped playing just Pokmon
<GOOD> Oh also I gotta play Partners in Time/Bowser's Inside Story
<GOOD> I beat SSS a week ago or so
<GOOD> YAYYYY NEW FNAF CHALLENGE VID
<GOOD> Daily injection of fnaf juice
<GOOD> I freed myself by going to Mario RPG into other RPGs into other games in general
<GOOD> I like Dream Team more
<GOOD> Dream Team still my favourite Mario RPG so far
<GOOD> Although I love Bowser so BiS might change that
<GOOD> I do plan to play TTYD but I'm broke as fuck rn so original
<GOOD> I also wanted to play the OG N64 one but for some reason it like
<GOOD> Rlly bored me I couldn't make progress
<GOOD> I don't know why
<GOOD> I need to try again how did I beat Sticker Star as a child but can't do this
<GOOD> Into the Pit might be my new favourite fnaf game ngl
<GOOD> Dormitabis
<GOOD> I wish I shared interests w my brother
<GOOD> It seems fun
<GOOD> SWAXE TRAILER
<GOOD> YEAAAAA
<GOOD> So cool so cool so cool
<GOOD> Congalala might be returning I understand
<GOOD> Some silhouetted armour resembles the Conga armour
<GOOD> Promo material or smth
<GOOD> Oh my god it's trying to send it again
<GOOD> Congalala is the GOAT that's why
<GOOD> Please let me move to Wales permanently
<GOOD> My dad votes reform and he literally just never stops talking about immigrants (minorities)
<GOOD> Literally every day
<GOOD> Multiple times a day
<GOOD> Because we have to live in England :((
<GOOD> I voted them too
<GOOD> They're apparently a centrist party but they seem more left than Labour so
<GOOD> I'm not a single issue voter but I'm trans and that takes a bit of precedence
<GOOD> And green party wanted to decommission nuclear plants and stuff so
<GOOD> And generally had a shaky plan
<GOOD> I didn't say weapons
<GOOD> Agree
<GOOD> I get to finally get to HR7 today omg
<GOOD> Then with any luck get White sharpness
<GOOD> How I look at the Rajang before using Elemental Discharge then rolling a billion times to max my sharpness
<GOOD> Looking at the women's makeup but shaking my head the entire time so the staff know I'm just disapproving and not wanting to buy it
<GOOD> Yea same aaa
<GOOD> Which sucks bc any regular section of a store w cosmetics is like 90% women and 10% men and 0% unisex
<GOOD> I tried but my mom said I was going the wrong way
<GOOD> Yea same
<GOOD> Yayyy
<GOOD> Yippee all grinding done
<GOOD> Except one Glavenus Pyroshell
<GOOD> Chat have any of you stood up to your pareents or like, had to become independent from them
<GOOD> How did you start
<GOOD> I need to start immediately in fact
<GOOD> Oh I can do that
<GOOD> Or have been ig
<GOOD> I honestly need this one
<GOOD> Trigger warning for a vent ig, don't click if you don't wanna see it
<GOOD> I overheard this :3
<GOOD> But yea I gotta uh, leave or at least start removing them from my life
<GOOD> 3?
<GOOD> I think it's 3
<GOOD> Tbf I think he wanted me to enlist
<GOOD> Which is like, fuck that
<GOOD> When he found out I liked Marine Bio he tried to push me towards like, the marines lol
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> The rest of his family doesn't talk to him
<GOOD> And my mom's side is patchy but mostly bigots or have their own thing going on
<GOOD> So I'm thinking grind tf out of extracurriculars at uni, use it to get a job, fill the CV, springboard from that + a degree into marine bio
<GOOD> The army
<GOOD> Or the marines or whatsver
<GOOD> He also wanted me to be an electrical engineer
<GOOD> Yk, real jobs
<GOOD> I wonder if there's any online qualification courses I could take
<GOOD> Problem with a student city in Wales is that everyone wants those jovs
<GOOD> Imma keep Searching but it's a very saturated market
<GOOD> Bc the jobs are a bit scarce
<GOOD> Yeah sorry
<GOOD> Yeah..
<GOOD> My friend has offered to let me crash if a crisis ever happens
<GOOD> But that's a last resort
<GOOD> They're all very old
<GOOD> I don't even know if there are many lmao
<GOOD> I live at uni 9 months of the year
<GOOD> I'm considering taking online courses for some little extra qualifications
<GOOD> I think my friend got lifeguard certified through online processes maybe I can do smth like that
<GOOD> I can actually swim p well I gotta work on my diving and stamina tho
<GOOD> Ahh
<GOOD> Ic
<GOOD> It was I agree
<GOOD> Anyway erm rule break excessive venting
<GOOD> Mods ban this person
<GOOD> Venting is being an asshole tbf
<GOOD> It's exactly how I am fr
<GOOD> Tbf idk what excessive is
<GOOD> Uhhh was I excessive
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I wanna draw sooooooooo bad
<GOOD> My dad hates it but like I loooove doodlin
<GOOD> Need to draw silli bird
<GOOD> Is Salazzle in USUM
<GOOD> Or just SM
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Much harder lmao my Mudsdale EQ'd once and one shot that totem
<GOOD> Salazzle at least
<GOOD> I meant totem
<GOOD> I am cheesed to meet them
<GOOD> Guys help into the pit has me addicted to fnaf even more than usual
<GOOD> It's so gorgeous pixel art wise
<GOOD> Also even though it's pixellated it doesn't look #retro which I really appreciate when fnaf historically has done that with pixellated stuff
<GOOD> Like the fnaf movie opening
<GOOD> He makes rlly good actual art tbf
<GOOD> That coffee machine game he made looks gorgeous
<GOOD> His retro minigame shit is rlly funny tho
<GOOD> This being purple guy originally had me sobbing looking back
<GOOD> No game or console resembles this it's too advanced for Atari
<GOOD> Also his legs are tiny I never noticed that
<GOOD> Ik it isn't his but massive upgrade
<GOOD> I think the fnaf 3 minigames look aight
<GOOD> The fnaf 2 ones needed a bit more polish imo, at least a few sprites
<GOOD> Not for more clarity just to more closely resemble a real console
<GOOD> Also holy fucking shit this might be some of the best pixel animation I've seen
<GOOD> Well like as a whole
<GOOD> It's rlly smooth
<GOOD> I don't think it's like super insane I think it just has a vibe I likd
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Aughhhhh Pittrap may be my new favourite animatronic, or at least push springbonnie up to 1 from 2
<GOOD> He reminds me of uh, Nightmare Cat/Rat from fnac 3
<GOOD> Fnaf 3 is closer to NES
<GOOD> Atari games look closer to 2 but with a more limited palette
<GOOD> I don't rlly care I just got brainrotted by so retro
<GOOD> Just people flinging Minecarts into space
<GOOD> Also holy fuck blood in a fnaf game
<GOOD> Like, actual wounds
<GOOD> Sorry if this is a spoiler
<GOOD> I can't afford the game rn because steam sale so I'm just watching too
<GOOD> This is endgame spoilers but I particularly love this scene
<GOOD> I love how organic pittrap is, it reminds me of Monster Rat who is one of my favourite fangame designs
<GOOD> I wanna draw but my dad will get mad
<GOOD> Decisions decisions
<GOOD> He's mad that I'm drawing instead of learning a language or studying (which I don't need to do yet)
<GOOD> It's a bit of a long story
<GOOD> YAYYYY
<GOOD> I love Kenshin
<GOOD> Kenshin is the best anyway
<GOOD> Aoshi is sick but whatever
<GOOD> I'm suprised Shishio isn't there
<GOOD> The main antagonist
<GOOD> Shishio is so funny he just rlly hates peace and democracy and just really wants to bring back the feudal era of Japan by shooting at the government in a battleship
<GOOD> He just really dislikes the government
<GOOD> He also is like mega rich and has a secret lair and shit which is how he bought an actual steel battleship
<GOOD> Rurouni Kenshin happens like, mid 1800s I think so that's kinda wild
<GOOD> Yeah it's set during then
<GOOD> So there's steam trains and shit and katana are outlawed
<GOOD> Kenshin only gets to hold one because it's not rlly a killing weapon
<GOOD> It's blunt on the outside so it's barely a sword
<GOOD> What, is that style in other media too?
<GOOD> Tbf Kenshin Himura is loosely based on a different wandering samurai iirc
<GOOD> Like an irl one
<GOOD> Oh that rings a bell
<GOOD> Wait what
<GOOD> Remake or original
<GOOD> OG feels more like a comfy adventure and is far longer, remake is only 1 season but newer nicer animation and feels more like a modern action anime
<GOOD> Old vs new
<GOOD> My dad is talking about government fearmongering and vaccines and gay people again
<GOOD> Get me out
<GOOD> Best game ever of its niche is a huge overstatement
<GOOD> Hell I'd even argue it's overhyped as being that BECAUSE it hit the mainstream
<GOOD> BB and DS3 above easy
<GOOD> Also this may be because the game  has comically variable balancing
<GOOD> If you use a certain type of spell or build, even heavy weapons, the game becomes insanely hard because of how fast everything is or their resistances
<GOOD> Conversely it becomes absolutely trivial to certain builds
<GOOD> Welp guess I can't do GU anymore
<GOOD> I was stonewalled at Diablos for a hot minute
<GOOD> But I'm getting to the point I need other players to do Hub quests now
<GOOD> It's the last quest of High rank
<GOOD> It's the G rank requirement quest
<GOOD> For hub at least
<GOOD> I need to get friends to play with in GU
<GOOD> I gotta do this too
<GOOD> But I think after GU imma do Rise
<GOOD> I need to do this later actually
<GOOD> I gotta get supplies for the G rank elder weapons
<GOOD> Monster Hunter GU
<GOOD> Generations Ultimate
<GOOD> I love Diablos now btw
<GOOD> I thought I was ready from Worlds, I wasn't
<GOOD> I meant to type World's
<GOOD> I should be fired
<GOOD> Yippee I get to fight Yian Kut Ku again
<GOOD> Tysm GU
<GOOD> Striker Lance is calling Skarm
<GOOD> Well when you get Enraged guard
<GOOD> It's so funny tho
<GOOD> You never have to move
<GOOD> You spam charge in GU too
<GOOD> Just slightly less
<GOOD> I think it's still your best DPS option
<GOOD> I've just been brainlessly using Swaxe for a while
<GOOD> Might try Guild Hammer again
<GOOD> I switched to Horn from Hammer because I was whiffing too many attacks
<GOOD> I can't decide what I want every few days lmao
<GOOD> I switch weapons every few days
<GOOD> I need to learn the ways
<GOOD> Swaxe and Swaxe agaij
<GOOD> Honestly hammer and lance is tempting
<GOOD> Hammer is p maneuverable in new gen iirc
<GOOD> I haven't used it but I think it is
<GOOD> Plus that wirebug hop is everything
<GOOD> I only used 2 weapons when I played World
<GOOD> So when I play IB and Rise I get to see the new movesets
<GOOD> Because when I was 12 and played MHW I used just dual blades the entire game and then after I got Gae Bolg Insect Glaive
<GOOD> But I sucked at both because I was 12
<GOOD> Me and Nergigante
<GOOD> Fuckin stupid child not using optimised decos
<GOOD> Honestly I'm happy because I can bring a sharp and a blunt weapon
<GOOD> So I can sever tails and break hard parts
<GOOD> In case I run into Khezu and don't want to feel like throwing myself off a bridge
<GOOD> Why is it the most needed monster grind in GU I don't understand
<GOOD> Like why did they give it such important recipes
<GOOD> I need to send them for heavy ore scraps rn
<GOOD> Mega Demondrug iirc
<GOOD> And Armorskin
<GOOD> this early?
<GOOD> I'm in G rank now
<GOOD> I'm fairly far in
<GOOD> I only need like 1 per quest
<GOOD> And I can make those and adamant pills fairly easy
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Although I haven't been using most of the stuff till recently because I was afraid it was hard to make
<GOOD> But as it turns out ancient potions and stuff are easy
<GOOD> Yea I used like 2 of them because I didn't understand what they were
<GOOD> I still don't understand what I'm gonna have to use them for tho
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I did wonder why the buff kept running out
<GOOD> I used like 3 against Diablos and nothing happened
<GOOD> Should I be using Mega Armorskin instead
<GOOD> Wait is that also the case with demondrug
<GOOD> And Hunter's Drink
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> It's a hunter art gauge buff
<GOOD> How do I grind bitterbugs btw
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I wish there were more slots
<GOOD> I also don't understand Palico stuff
<GOOD> Like at all it seems so annoying
<GOOD> Training them and levelling them up and teaching them specific inherited skills and shit
<GOOD> And enthusiasm and how you need like 50 billion Palicoes
<GOOD> But I do want good hunting Palicoes
<GOOD> Especially healing and Plundering ones
<GOOD> These Elder Weapons are a godsend
<GOOD> Literally just a free easy power boost for every single weapon it's so smatt
<GOOD> At the start of G rank you can craft things like Elder Horn, Elder Hammer etc
<GOOD> I guess
<GOOD> Yea so I can actually try my weapons again now
<GOOD> Yian Kut Ku on its way to be a very easy but annoying roadblock
<GOOD> Yet again
<GOOD> I need to see the glowup Garuga got in World
<GOOD> Because Garuga is kind of growing on me but the poison tail pisses me tf off lmao
<GOOD> I'm gonna golf swing his ass into another dimension
<GOOD> Slam. Slam. Golfswing.
<GOOD> Diablos too
<GOOD> Like what's his problem
<GOOD> He's growing on me very quick for that reason tho
<GOOD> I know Yian Kut Ku is
<GOOD> I had a cool dream last night
<GOOD> We went into a tomb and someone walked down into a hole there and started speaking in tongues, and everyone except me was compelled to throw themselves into a pit of sand and start burying themselves and became like, zombie type creatures
<GOOD> And also zombie Joe and Quagmire from family guy was there and Arnold Schwarzenegger for some reason
<GOOD> Just like a group of various people
<GOOD> And then it was an action movie sequence where I was running from them and beating the shit out of them while the land was being pulled into where the tomb was
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It rlly sucks but none of it bleeds into the manga
<GOOD> You probably could yea
<GOOD> I also like Toriko which sucks because bro was arrested for the same reason as this guy
<GOOD> Although I'm fairly sure his turned out not guilty
<GOOD> If any of it bled into the anime it probably wouldn't have gotten a remake
<GOOD> Aniwave with Ublock:
<GOOD> Ublock origin is a free browser extension
<GOOD> Aniwave is a website
<GOOD> It takes 5 seconds and a google search
<GOOD> Plus ublock origin is good for everything lol
<GOOD> I have the extension on my tablet's browser too, plus the website isn't that bad even without a blocker if you just back out of the tabs
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> It also notably gives you Access to basically any anime you want
<GOOD> And ublock origin requires no setup apart from enabling it in the extension thing
<GOOD> But idrc if you do or don't so
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I don't think I've ever hit red sharpness in MH
<GOOD> However this does remind me to do G rank today
<GOOD> Who framed roger rabbit is peak
<GOOD> I just saw someone drive fully on the pavement after I slipped past their car, and they took up the entire pavement and then proceeded to indicate their turn before turning off the road into a junction where the traffic next to them was going the other way
<GOOD> All still on the pavement
<GOOD> Just occurred to me that some people pronounce chicken breast like the word beast probably
<GOOD> Chicken breast
<GOOD> They probably do
<GOOD> They're like lemme cut up this chicken breast rn and their friends gonna be like what is that why are you pronouncing it that way
<GOOD> Chicken breast
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Chicken breast
<GOOD> Morn
<GOOD> Wait Rise has layered weapons?
<GOOD> So cool
<GOOD> Wait does GU have layered armour
<GOOD> Oh sick
<GOOD> Idm that
<GOOD> That's strange
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> You help him film a video
<GOOD> The crossover happened in the middle of the Ava allegations
<GOOD> Also I beat G rank Yian Kut Ku
<GOOD> He's so fun
<GOOD> Gypceros can still die in a hole tho
<GOOD> Got my playlist lined up
<GOOD> No it's the Pomni guy
<GOOD> And the Poppy Playtime guy
<GOOD> a hidden talent tbh
<GOOD> I love how all of his songs follow this exact structure
<GOOD> My name is DJ and I can't escape r/pokemon
<GOOD> Look at his other songs
<GOOD> Especially the dogday ons
<GOOD> It's so peak
<GOOD> 3lame already did that
<GOOD> He also dethroned this guy by making the best fan song ever
<GOOD> Me after the lobotomy
<GOOD> LHUGENY made one banger
<GOOD> 3lame only had to make one song to make history...
<GOOD> My name is Cuphead and I can't escape the hole in my brain
<GOOD> Almost G2 in the GU
<GOOD> I saw this and I want it too
<GOOD> G rank don't fuck around
<GOOD> I almost carted to a Royal Ludroth
<GOOD> I saw this gif months ago it's so funny
<GOOD> Waow Alchemy Hammer is awesome
<GOOD> Please let me stream monkey game I hate women trust me let me stream!!!
<GOOD> Raaaaagh the new spider is so cool
<GOOD> Never pass a Khezu fan the aux
<GOOD> Wait  have u played this
<GOOD> I summon thee
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Are these RE remasters bad
<GOOD> Ok good
<GOOD> I forgot whether it was that or Silent Hill
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I might straight up buy the RE ones lol
<GOOD> The bundle
<GOOD> It's only 23
<GOOD> I've been spending a lot recently tho :((
<GOOD> Maybe I'll wait a bit
<GOOD> I already have it, I'm just limiting myself
<GOOD> I already bought 32 of MH and 15 of Sonic Generations this week
<GOOD> Yo
<GOOD> I set a reminder for 8th September to buy it
<GOOD> I've already played Gens it's just so I can mod it down the line
<GOOD> Since it's bundle only after Sonic x Shadow releases
<GOOD> Aura
<GOOD> Perhaps
<GOOD> Shadow the hedgehog first tho
<GOOD> Cat
<GOOD> Why is this the only official render
<GOOD> I hate this monster
<GOOD> I love the random doodles on my phone
<GOOD> I decided I didn't wanna scream today so I didn't play GU
<GOOD> 4 Hyper Nargacuga hunts more like no thanks amirite
<GOOD> Hyper Nargacuga scales
<GOOD> I need to craft the Narg hammer for G rank
<GOOD> That was a real streaming guide
<GOOD> I love Shagaru Magala

<GOOD> Woa wtf
<GOOD> Wish it was gear 5 tho
<GOOD> Lmaoooooo ppl under 30 can move for free in the EU maybe
<GOOD> That's rlly funny I like it
<GOOD> There's like a tax for travelling to the EU or smth because brexit
<GOOD> I still haven't finished
<GOOD> Oh my god just make characterssss
<GOOD> Oh right it's happening near here too
<GOOD> I think bears can be lesbians
<GOOD> Mr X better
<GOOD> Also they already killed this dude and shoved him out of the MH community immediately lol
<GOOD> 0 people agreed with him except people that haven't played
<GOOD> I think he was actually part of a few
<GOOD> Before he got kicked out
<GOOD> Also psyop monkey game has been branded based and anti woke
<GOOD> I forgot Blue Yian Kut Ku exists
<GOOD> I love being unemployed on a Friday
<GOOD> The entire theatre is empty
<GOOD> Aliens gonna get my ass if I'm alone when it starts
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I wish the theatre was a little less empty
<GOOD> I feel sick
<GOOD> Good movie tho
<GOOD> My RAM is downloaded
<GOOD> So retro
<GOOD> Undertale is retro
<GOOD> It has pixels so yes
<GOOD> Celeste is so #retro
<GOOD> Oh I just picked it up because it's fun and I love platformers
<GOOD> I grew up on Super Meaty Boy
<GOOD> Meat
<GOOD> Not meaty
<GOOD> I can't wait to start Rise tomorrow
<GOOD> I want to buy a PS3 just to play MGS4
<GOOD> Marcel is.... Retro media?????
<GOOD> Media discourse is awesome just call everything without a panic attack bad
<GOOD> Bowser if he was retro
<GOOD> (made of irl pixels)
<GOOD> Media if it was REAL???
<GOOD> Cyn they could never make me hate you
<GOOD> Rise time today
<GOOD> How much those are so cool
<GOOD> Yeah that's Lucci's
<GOOD> Decent
<GOOD> It literally does lol
<GOOD> Leopard fruit
<GOOD> A little
<GOOD> I was trying not to spoilong but forgot that a while ago is still over 1000 eps in
<GOOD> Spoilers for current OP manga ||6/7ths of a person died this arc dw||
<GOOD> Didn't it start during Luffy vs Kat
<GOOD> So like barely even that arc
<GOOD> Oooo I love the terrariums
<GOOD> Also fought G Rank Congalala
<GOOD> Nah it's just a really good fight
<GOOD> High rank Conga was shit but like this one was fun asf
<GOOD> I wanna try Hammer in World and Riae
<GOOD> Rise
<GOOD> Swaxe
<GOOD> Haiiii Dipper
<GOOD> I'm slowing down in GU this game tough
<GOOD> I'm sleepy my dad is starting to make me tired
<GOOD> 20 more days
<GOOD> I leave this place and go back to uni
<GOOD> Marine biology
<GOOD> It's less stressful than home
<GOOD> So that's good
<GOOD> Far less stressful in fact
<GOOD> They're very very fun I love how they look
<GOOD> Very mystical weird creaturas
<GOOD> Worse than jellyfish
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> As all jellies are
<GOOD> Waow 2020 is almost 5 years ago
<GOOD> What a trill
<GOOD> The RH community has invaded the conveyor belt meme
<GOOD> This is Olimar and Louie btw
<GOOD> My favourite is its evolution lol
<GOOD> I actually got like, the Negatibuzz variant in 2 from the Crank a Kai the other day
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> But the variant is called like Zitchy or whatever
<GOOD> Scritchy that's it
<GOOD> It's just a yellow Mosquevil
<GOOD> Piss
<GOOD> I didn't even know Mosquevil was in 1
<GOOD> 2 is very fun so far tho
<GOOD> Yeah I just didn't evolve it as a kid
<GOOD> I was addicted to Robanyan
<GOOD> I didn't know weather specific spawns were in YKW
<GOOD> Same I just haven't gotten it yet
<GOOD> I spammed Venoct and Robanyan as a kid
<GOOD> I think my favourite part of YKW is how it's grounded in real life
<GOOD> Like scritchy is just a yokai that causes itchiness
<GOOD> Iirc Apelican is literally a Westaboo yokai
<GOOD> Oh and the music
<GOOD> Yaaaa I agree
<GOOD> That also benefits bc Nate is an actual character
<GOOD> And therefore bounces off Whisper much better
<GOOD> Yeah but he is something
<GOOD> Ibashinary incendiary, shlip shlop wiggle boom slim slam legendaryyyyy
<GOOD> Wait what
<GOOD> I gotta find out how to emulate switch at some point then
<GOOD> When are WE playing GU
<GOOD> I have discovered that I think Ryujinx runs on my PC
<GOOD> I need to test it then play Yo Kai Watch 4 English patch at some point
<GOOD> Haiii chat
<GOOD> I think your best options are a marketplace second hand prebuilt or raw parts ngl
<GOOD> I did the former
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> Idk how to assemble a PC from scratch so I'm just upgrading this one
<GOOD> I need either GPU, CPU or storage upgrade next
<GOOD> But idk which
<GOOD> Intel core i3 8350k CPU
16gb DDR4 RAM
256GB nvme OS drive 
512GB SSD
AMD Radeon rx6400 4gb GPU
750w platinum PSU
<GOOD> That's what I'm running rn
<GOOD> Just a gaming machine ngl
<GOOD> Hi Dipper
<GOOD> I thought I was gonna die last night
<GOOD> So much water
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I drank all of this in like 4 hours
<GOOD> I bought it that afternoon and don't usually hydrate this much so I was dying
<GOOD> I have this bookmarked
<GOOD> Yaaaaa I kinda took it upon myself to drink the entire thing once I drank half of it
<GOOD> Poor judgement in the end but my remaining masculinity was on the line
<GOOD> Does anyone have that video where he reads someone's names in blocks and a thwomp immediately comes down and kills him
<GOOD> Fruity sensory video raaaaa
<GOOD> Volume warning
<GOOD> Truuuue
<GOOD> Kill this person?
>Yes
No
<GOOD> The shopping list....
<GOOD> Gotta choose between grinding Plesioth and throwing myself off a bridge
<GOOD> And the bridge is tempting
<GOOD> I gotta grind in GU again aaaaaah
<GOOD> And the shopping list sucks
<GOOD> G2
<GOOD> I gotta get Ceana armour so I can get to G3 and upgrade my Narg hammer even further
<GOOD> Yesterday I did the Hyper Narg hunts necessary and a few G rank Nargs, then a few G rank Ceanas
<GOOD> I think Ceana armour should carry me through to postgame
<GOOD> Then I can make Jho Ceana or smth
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Unfortunately that means hunting Hyper Jho
<GOOD> Hyper Ceana probably isn't too bad
<GOOD> Esp with Hammer
<GOOD> Can someone tell me to keep playing MH now
<GOOD> Are you referring to MH Now or MH, now
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I thought you meant immediately
<GOOD> I wish I knew I could get the MHGUDB app much earlier than this
<GOOD> But it's so helpful
<GOOD> Yeah apk only
<GOOD> But they're very helpful
<GOOD> Fuuuuck I don't wanna murder Plesioth today
<GOOD> Probably my least favourite monster
<GOOD> To fight
<GOOD> Also I cooked Lavasioth, for some reason it was way easier than Plesi
<GOOD> I think waterblight just sucks significantly more and it doesn't have the openings that Lavasioth soes
<GOOD> Because Plesioth doesn't do the diving underground thing
<GOOD> I might put off Plesioth by just hunting HR Ceanataur
<GOOD> Also using hammer for the bipedal big monsters just kinda sucks in general
<GOOD> Bc they only put their heads down when they're tired
<GOOD> And iirc not even golfswing hits Plesioth
<GOOD> Nah it's that stupid shoulder barge
<GOOD> It also has that stupid attack when it dives on the ground and ends up miles away
<GOOD> It sucks
<GOOD> I hate Plesioth
<GOOD> Yeah I will, still sucks
<GOOD> And it sucks
<GOOD> Also I fought Akantor and I'm rlly getting tired of instakill lasers
<GOOD> Like can u not just make it rlly damaging and not a one shot
<GOOD> I'm in full Rath S gear
<GOOD> So idk like 20 ish
<GOOD> This was Hub 7 star so not even G rank
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I think once you unlock G rank it's in the Hub 7 quests
<GOOD> Alongside a few others
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> I needed to kill one of them for a wyvern crystal
<GOOD> Carted twice to the stupid ass laser
<GOOD> Yes but I don't understand them and I'm playing Solo rn
<GOOD> So it's kinda ass
<GOOD> I tried HBG a bit but like eh
<GOOD> That would require making gunner armour and a new HBG
<GOOD> Hammer is shit for Plesioth but it's whatever
<GOOD> Hopefully I never have to hunt it again
<GOOD> Hhhhhh
<GOOD> The game's grinding has gotten rlly annoying since I hit G rank
<GOOD> No one around rn
<GOOD> Plus no one wants to fight Plesioth lmaooooo
<GOOD> I dislike Plesioth
<GOOD> Nice
<GOOD> I haven't opened the game yet
<GOOD> Gimme a sec and I'll summon thee
<GOOD> I summon thee, 65-4725-9737-7197
<GOOD> And code 7463
<GOOD> I'll be in a quest
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> I was queueing ip Ceanataur but I'll load in Plesioth
<GOOD> 1 shard from carves....
<GOOD> Praying I get more than 1 from rewards
<GOOD> I don't wanna fight this dude 3 times
<GOOD> It was just the one that carted me
<GOOD> Also I have 3 of the 5 shards I need
<GOOD> So 1 more
<GOOD> Because you can shred the monster lol
<GOOD> Ok with any luck, final Plesioth kill
<GOOD> I don't want to kill any more
<GOOD> They suck
<GOOD> Do you wanna do anything after this, if not idm
<GOOD> K
<GOOD> Oh right that
<GOOD> We're done I hate this mf
<GOOD> And he sucks
<GOOD> Ok Ceana time
<GOOD> I LOVE STUN I LOVE STUN I LOVE STUN I LOVE
<GOOD> Showering you in alchemy juicd
<GOOD> I forgot to carve it
<GOOD> Too lost in the juice
<GOOD> I gotta watch
<GOOD> Ok done
<GOOD> When I was sprinting in circles I was watching it
<GOOD> I heard the sting
<GOOD> It's rlly heat
<GOOD> Ya same for me
<GOOD> I got 1 item I needed from that last hunt btw
<GOOD> Despite breaking the part that gives it twice AND carving
<GOOD> Anyway SILKSONG TIME!!!!!
<GOOD> I honestly think this is the one Dipper
<GOOD> Like I think Silksong trailer is now
<GOOD> Like, yk what's indie AND a partner maybe?
<GOOD> Silksong
<GOOD> Balatro
<GOOD> Double what
<GOOD> Triple what
<GOOD> No silksong crossover bc they're saving it for the end
<GOOD> Actually imagine if that's how they transition between the showcases
<GOOD> I forgot what's usually in a partner direct ngl
<GOOD> MH Wilds port
<GOOD> Omg it's team cherry
<GOOD> Wait nvm
<GOOD> Place Japan
<GOOD> Silksong is downloadable content BC it's probably able to be downloaded from the eshop
<GOOD> It's Silksong
<GOOD> Mice are small like bugs
<GOOD> Oh right the furniture visual novel
<GOOD> Probably post credits lmao
<GOOD> Oh right I forgot about this
<GOOD> Hyped for this one
<GOOD> OH MY GODDDD
<GOOD> This pizza? I found it while listening to this song about silk...
<GOOD> Ok now it's silksong time
<GOOD> what do you think they'll have in the silksong trailer
<GOOD> Omg Tetris port
<GOOD> Wait this is sick
<GOOD> It's a remaster iirc
<GOOD> Ok here's silksong
<GOOD> Omg Worms
<GOOD> TERRY
<GOOD> Wow that SF collection looks heat
<GOOD> WHAAAAAT
<GOOD> NIGHTS ATS FREDD
<GOOD> It was free too
<GOOD> Only during the jumpscare
<GOOD> Close enough to Silksong
<GOOD> I think this direct was horrible
<GOOD> Still grabbing the Terry game maybe tho
<GOOD> Anyway time to grind in GU again
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Yaaa
<GOOD> Waaaaa I love Shadow sm and only Shadow
<GOOD> People are happy it failed bc woke or smth
<GOOD> Yea I rlly don't like the cast
<GOOD> Also dipper I have 3/5 of the armour pieces I need
<GOOD> We're so close
<GOOD> I only have to fight the crab in G rank a few times anyway
<GOOD> Then it's all high rank kills
<GOOD> I think after this I don't have to grind at all until ||whatever Ahtal Ka is||
<GOOD> Minus maybe upgrading my hammer at G3
<GOOD> But that means I have to fight Hyper G rank Nargacuga
<GOOD> So uh
<GOOD> Ok it's cool asf
<GOOD> However I don't hugely love it, it's just rlly cool
<GOOD> Chibi Mothman is weird
<GOOD> Is that Dan Hentschel
<GOOD> Ok it's cool
<GOOD> I'm so obsessed with Shadow rn for some reason
<GOOD> Year of Shadow tightens its grip
<GOOD> I still need to play SA2
<GOOD> Shadow has literally captured me on aura alone so far
<GOOD> And his few appearances in uh
<GOOD> Other games I played as a kid
<GOOD> But his appearances are brief so
<GOOD> Just aura
<GOOD> He's literally my favourite sonic character by far
<GOOD> It used to be metal sonic but yeah Shadow exceeds it
<GOOD> Still incomplete
<GOOD> But he's fairly high up there
<GOOD> Yeah it's metal as fuck I'm hyped
<GOOD> I love weird fleshy eldritch beings
<GOOD> Falin
<GOOD> Dungeon Meshi
<GOOD> I need to play Shadow the Hedgehog fr
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> I need to peel myself from MHGU
<GOOD> Also is the teleportation in the sonic 3 trailer Chaos Control
<GOOD> I don't know what powers Shadow actually has
<GOOD> I just know he has that power
<GOOD> He just vanishes into red lightning
<GOOD> I need to read IDW too
<GOOD> Fun fact I loved metal sonic so much as a kid my dad had to yell at me a bunch to stop talking about him
<GOOD> Shadow my favourite now tho
<GOOD> He was my second favourite as a kid
<GOOD> Idk what other things Shadow does except be fast tho
<GOOD> I don't know enough characters
<GOOD> The most obscure character I know arguably is Jet
<GOOD> And he's not obscure
<GOOD> As a kid I loved the yellow and black metal sonic on the PSP game
<GOOD> I believe he's called 3.0
<GOOD> I used him in the Wii one lol
<GOOD> Of course, he's one of my favourites
<GOOD> I was correct
<GOOD> He's called 3.0
<GOOD> Wait lmao he is
<GOOD> That's so cool
<GOOD> Oh I also like Big ofc
<GOOD> He was my GOAT in the shitty Sonic DS RPG
<GOOD> Which I played a ton as a kid
<GOOD> Yesh
<GOOD> I played it like a lot
<GOOD> I don't think I got very far but I played it a lot
<GOOD> Same as Rush DS's sequel
<GOOD> Yeah nah I played this
<GOOD> And Black Knight
<GOOD> Sonic Frontiers wishes
<GOOD> Need a Frontiers mod that replaces the songs when you fight against the Titans with this music
<GOOD> I'm sorry but the Chronicles one is so much worse
<GOOD> I'm laughing my ass off these are so bad
<GOOD> Oh wait does the Black Knight count as an obscure sonic character
<GOOD> At least compared to like, Omega or Surge or Jet
<GOOD> I know you'll know exactly what I mean but I can't describe it, but why did they do that
<GOOD> The song is ok otherwise but why did they do that
<GOOD> Can you patch the gake with this remade thing
<GOOD> Or is it just a soundtrack
<GOOD> Dipper I was raised on Sonic Chronicles
<GOOD> And Black Knight, and Rush DS, and the PSP one
<GOOD> Idk the PSP name
<GOOD> I think it was Rivals 2
<GOOD> The game
<GOOD> I also played Forces later on and Unleashed Wii but didn't get far in Unleashed Wii
<GOOD> No bangers just straight ass
<GOOD> (except Colours Wii and Black Knight)
<GOOD> And generations when I got thsre
<GOOD> I used to main this team iirc
<GOOD> I don't like Espio anymore
<GOOD> I used to as a kid
<GOOD> What the fuck this is such a good team
<GOOD> Omega and Shadow on the same team
<GOOD> Idk anything about Rouge yet
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> How many games can you even play as Shadow in
<GOOD> Like it can't be many
<GOOD> SA2, Sonic x Shadow, uh.
<GOOD> Sonic the Fighters???
<GOOD> 06....
<GOOD> I know what I have to do
<GOOD> Can I even emulate these games
<GOOD> Like I wanna play unleashed but I don't think I can emulate Unleashed
<GOOD> I do have a nasty 16GB of RAM now
<GOOD> So I can try and emulate more stuff now idk
<GOOD> Intel core i3 8350k CPU
16gb DDR4 RAM
256GB nvme OS drive 
512GB SSD
AMD Radeon rx6400 4gb GPU
750w platinum PSU
<GOOD> I may be ok to try and emulate smth beefier
<GOOD> Where is Omega
<GOOD> Shaming smh
<GOOD> Prebuilt and idk much about PCs
<GOOD> So idk what to upgrade
<GOOD> I barely even know what the parts so
<GOOD> I heard I have to replace the entire mboard is that true
<GOOD> BC I really don't wanna
<GOOD> Ughhh
<GOOD> Idk enough about PCs to be doing that
<GOOD> Like I have to dismantle the entire thing
<GOOD> And idk how to put it back together if I do that
<GOOD> In fact all I've upgraded is the RAM
<GOOD> Which was very easy ofc
<GOOD> Oh my god I do need to take the entire thing apart fuck lmaoooo
<GOOD> I'm never gonna be able to do that
<GOOD> You're a colourful bunch
<GOOD> WHAT LMAO
<GOOD> Gen Z is trying to cancel ?Ice T
<GOOD> Gonna start tweaking at MH ngl
<GOOD> Yeah but silver rathalos sucks
<GOOD> Need
<GOOD> I actually agree with you for once on smth like this
<GOOD> I think as a standalone game this is ok but I don't want MH to become this
<GOOD> Hmmm, should I go backwards or forwards after GU
<GOOD> I might do Rise
<GOOD> 3DS
<GOOD> Seltas Queen, Diablos, Duramboros
<GOOD> I don't think disliking Plesioth or Silver Rathalos are hot takes
<GOOD> And Khezu
<GOOD> Like these are some of the least liked hunts
<GOOD> I'm so good at video games (old clip)
<GOOD> Khegg
<GOOD> Ok so I made it to Lao
<GOOD> Like I literally cannot beat him
<GOOD> will you be available tomorrow afternoon, idk ur time zone
<GOOD> Ok I may need you to fight Lao with me
<GOOD> I hate this fucker
<GOOD> Yeah that's why I'm asking bc everyone else is telling me that just shooting it works
<GOOD> (it doesn't)
<GOOD> I watched the guide but he has a bunch of skills and talismans and decos I don't have
<GOOD> Like no bruh I don't wanna grind again just because Lao sucks ass
<GOOD> I must have missed like 3 Ballista shots genuinely
<GOOD> Idk what's up with Lao
<GOOD> I also had Bombardier
<GOOD> I also broke Lao's back and flinched it a few times so like
<GOOD> Idk when it's safe to say his phase is over
<GOOD> I honestly just wanna do it w people
<GOOD> Because it's just not fun
<GOOD> How do you tell when the first phase is over
<GOOD> It's not fun with people but it's POSSIBLE
<GOOD> Well he destroys the outer wall and the hunt fails
<GOOD> There's 2 walls
<GOOD> Why does the hunt fail
<GOOD> 35 minutes
<GOOD> Then why is there a second wall
<GOOD> And I have to repel it for 35 minutes without it destroying a wall that takes like 5 seconds?
<GOOD> I must have missed some cannonballs
<GOOD> Idk I just despise this hunt
<GOOD> It's shit and I'm getting tired of GU
<GOOD> Because I spent multiple days grinding just to be immediately stonewalled
<GOOD> I just wanna go through to G3
<GOOD> >look at G3 hub key quests
>It's the Fated Four again
<GOOD> I wanna play 4U
<GOOD> Or Rise/Iceborne
<GOOD> But to do IB I'd have to run through w defender armour so idk
<GOOD> Same as 3U
<GOOD> I also wanna try Rise
<GOOD> Idk what its deal is
<GOOD> PC
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I still don't even have a hunting party in GU lmao
<GOOD> TRANS CHAT RAAAA
<GOOD> This bowser render fucks
<GOOD> I love Bowser
<GOOD> I enjoyed Animal Farm when I read it for school
<GOOD> And to a lesser extent, An Inspector Calls
<GOOD> I need this artbook but it's 30
<GOOD> Nah just 560 pages of pure lore and illustrations
<GOOD> Oh it's super fair I'm just stingy
<GOOD> Has the splatfest started yet
<GOOD> Oh ok I gotta get ready for big run then
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Perusing
<GOOD> It's literally 560 pages of MH lore, concept art, art in general, worldbuilding, story detail etc
<GOOD> will you be around today
<GOOD> Ok, I may require your services
<GOOD> I'll be available for the next like 3 to 4 hours idk
<GOOD> GU
<GOOD> I need help with Lao Shan Lung
<GOOD> I'll check
<GOOD> I only need 1 or 2 ppl other than me tbh I just need an extra person to beat the shit out of Lao
<GOOD> It's an urgent G2 quest so probably somewhere around there
<GOOD> I shall look
<GOOD> It's a G2 quest that gets you to G3
<GOOD> It says 9 and up
<GOOD> Imma try it solo one more time ig
<GOOD> Ok, make a lobby if u want
<GOOD> Lao is just bombing anyway
<GOOD> Is that a local lobby
<GOOD> Or online
<GOOD> It isn't showing up
<GOOD> Wait one sec
<GOOD> Misinput
<GOOD> Oh right I may have to search in Hub instead of Pub
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Oh same
<GOOD> Weird
<GOOD> There we go
<GOOD> Damn I didn't get to break the horns
<GOOD> I wasn't gonna anyway tbh
<GOOD> I was bouncing at white sharpness
<GOOD> Ok Lao time, do you want to do the cannons or do you want to do ballistas
<GOOD> Uh I'll do cannons ig
<GOOD> Try and get a felyne bombardier
<GOOD> Hit every shot you can and wait at the start bc the ballista isn't far range
<GOOD> After he roars and starts walking he'll almost be in range of ballistas
<GOOD> Yea don't go near the feet
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> He'll break ballistae be careful
<GOOD> Follow me
<GOOD> Grab cannonballs
<GOOD> There's cannonballs in the hub area use those
<GOOD> Ballista down here if u want
<GOOD> He's gonna attack that bridge be careful
<GOOD> I HATE THIS RAID I HATE THIS FUCKING RAID
<GOOD> HOW MUCH FUCKING DAMAGE DO I NEED TO DO
<GOOD> JESUS CHRIST
<GOOD> Also leave the cannonball escorting to me until area 2 since I have earplugs
<GOOD> Can't drop cannonballs
<GOOD> Other than that we just pray ig
<GOOD> You're on ballista
<GOOD> Good
<GOOD> FUCK YEAH
<GOOD> Yeah I got some mantles
<GOOD> Ty, that hunt was truly miserable
<GOOD> What we needed was to shoot him in the back like a billion times
<GOOD> Yeah me and Jux did
<GOOD> I'm almost at Valstrax now, I just gotta do 2 more key quests in G3
<GOOD> Barioth and Gravios tomorrow
<GOOD> I can't wait to try CB it seems so cool
<GOOD> I'll figure out morphing well soon enough
<GOOD> Imma use Striker
<GOOD> They go out of play for 1 year after you use this
<GOOD> Rugby is kinda fun to watch sometimes
<GOOD> Although tbh MMA is a sport I'd actually consider watching voluntarily
<GOOD> All I know about football is that ppl hate VAR now for being accurate
<GOOD> Well actually I know a fair bit but that's the most recent thing
<GOOD> It's basically like, a monitoring room full of tech that the referee passes hard decisions to
<GOOD> There's a bunch of guys monitoring everything from there
<GOOD> At least that's my understanding
<GOOD> Idk I've seen most decisions pass fairly easy
<GOOD> Also arguably goals and major fouls are the most important parts of a match, they should be verified
<GOOD> Oh ic
<GOOD> But yea football isn't usually my thing
<GOOD> Erm sorry but being obsessed to the point of tribalism with a REAL MAN'S THING makes it cool
<GOOD> Ok Charge Blade... Actually makes sense now?
<GOOD> I need to still use it but that's a great start
<GOOD> I have reached Valstrax
<GOOD> I'm taking a break bc Gravios and Barioth back to back pissed me off
<GOOD> So Valstrax tomorrow
<GOOD> I wanna try CB but I only have good hammers
<GOOD> I might use CB and grind out some high rank hunts to learn
<GOOD> BC I understand it slightly
<GOOD> And apparently striker is fun
<GOOD> Raaaaaaa Valstrax repellex
<GOOD> New favourite monster I'm pissed that I didn't finish the job tho
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I carted once and that stopped me slaying it
<GOOD> But yeah he was super fun
<GOOD> Not super difficult either
<GOOD> Alch Hammer fucked it up
<GOOD> Like its DPS check charge thing just fell apart BC I slapped it around a bunch
<GOOD> But yea no G4 yet I wanna chill
<GOOD> This person fucking sucks at Mario
<GOOD> I love that video sm
<GOOD> I tried speedrunning pikmin once but too hard to memorise
<GOOD> Dipper
<GOOD> I'm in G4
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> As in sure I don't mind
<GOOD> So woke..........
<GOOD> I fw the yellow robot tho
<GOOD> Hiiiii
<GOOD> I'd fw this dude if his pants weren't so damn high
<GOOD> He also looks like there's a bomb strapped to his chest
<GOOD> Also the girl that looks ripped from WH40K is aight
<GOOD> That's about it tho
<GOOD> Actual foghorn SFX
<GOOD> Their fits are ass
<GOOD> He looks like the 30 year old that buys thousand dollar gear to shoot children in paintball
<GOOD> Wait Concord is getting shut down???
<GOOD> I didn't even know vro
<GOOD> Dipper these key quests are gonna kill me
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> These are such evil key quests
<GOOD> I can't do these yet
<GOOD> But it's shit like Tigrex, Rajang etc
<GOOD> Not too bad
<GOOD> I do love Glavenus
<GOOD> However Gravios can suck it
<GOOD> Worst fight in the game possibly
<GOOD> Giving Gravios hitscan at medium range is such bullshit
<GOOD> And it wastes so much time
<GOOD> He's so ass
<GOOD> Ok so my other key quests are:
Rajang
Tigrex
Diablos
Deviljho
<GOOD> Who are all manageable
<GOOD> I did against HR Jho
<GOOD> It's fun but in practice hard to get off what u need
<GOOD> Peakcord
<GOOD> It was announced at Gamescom or whatever that recent one was
<GOOD> Apparently it's a very solid cutesy platformer
<GOOD> And it has Sol Badguy
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I woke up an hour ago and I'm still in bed
<GOOD> Waiting for my partner to wake up but I'm doing well
<GOOD> Recenty
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's fairly fresh I'd say like 2 weeks lol
<GOOD> 8 days until I go back to university so I'm happy
<GOOD> I'm also just way happier there anyway lol
<GOOD> They do I'm in a gaming society
<GOOD> I entered a random casual tournament and won in MK1 and Strive but got my ass absolutely destroyed in Tekken by someone who actually played
<GOOD> Haiiiii
<GOOD> Decent
<GOOD> More Monster Hunting planned today :3
<GOOD> Being casually hated like everywhere is so draining
<GOOD> 2 more monsters and then I'm asking for a carry bru
<GOOD> I'm nearly done with GU
<GOOD> My mom wants to watch it rlly badly
<GOOD> Peakai Watch
<GOOD> That's Cheeksqueak
<GOOD> The west has fallen
<GOOD> Also dipper I found the armour I'm gonna transmog when I beat GU
<GOOD> I've GYATT to buy Miitopia!!!
<GOOD> Do you happen to know if the pigment change changes all of it
<GOOD> I wanna make it not banana if possible
<GOOD> Also Yo Kai Watch mention
<GOOD> I'm unsure but many yokai are just new ideas
<GOOD> But even the concept of a yokai is inherently japanese
<GOOD> Like, Apelican is not a real yokai
<GOOD> Awesome
<GOOD> Also apparently Apelican makes you a westaboo
<GOOD> Which is a really funny power
<GOOD> My favourite is Scritchy
<GOOD> I forgot the normal name
<GOOD> Scritchy is too funny
<GOOD> Bowser f
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> There's a lot of yokai
<GOOD> Massiface
<GOOD> The bosses in Yokai Watch are peak
<GOOD> There's specific coin only yokai
<GOOD> Basically they distribute event yokai through QR codes, so all of them are still available today
<GOOD> Like, literally every QR code can be found with a Google
<GOOD> But some rarer yokai require gambling on the crank a kai with rare coins
<GOOD> In game
<GOOD> 3 cranks a day (you can timeskip abuse)
<GOOD> Either streetpass coins or coins you get from the Qr Codes/find around the world
<GOOD> But yea you can access every distribution yokai item
<GOOD> So they are event yokai, but not time restricted god bless
<GOOD> This is why YKW the goat...
<GOOD> Depends on if genning software exists or smth
<GOOD> You probably could
<GOOD> There are a lot of those
<GOOD> They are statistically different and have different effects both canonically and in game
<GOOD> Usually the recolour is way stronger
<GOOD> Also oddly enough the recolours usually don't have the pre-evos
<GOOD> Grainpa slander detected
<GOOD> Show
<GOOD> I believe it's a boss
<GOOD> Armsman
<GOOD> You fuse it with a different yokai to make a full human being yokai
<GOOD> If you fuse Armsman and Helmsman you get Reuknight
<GOOD> You have a bad name
<GOOD> Also the yokai names in general are heat
<GOOD> You suck smhsmh
<GOOD> Yokai watch names mog your name
<GOOD> Massiface? Peak
<GOOD> Massiface
<GOOD> It's because he's massive and has a face
<GOOD> I think I'm unwell or smth because I didn't even look at this properly and immediately noticed the Zinogre
<GOOD> I literally only glanced
<GOOD> Oh I did once I looked again
<GOOD> But Zinogre I somehow noticed based on coloured patterns alone
<GOOD> I beat GU
<GOOD> Ahtal Ka
<GOOD> Slos farming tomorrow
<GOOD> And then after that Crim Fatty for the hammer and maybe Insect Glaive if I like it enough
<GOOD> I truly don't wanna fight Slos
<GOOD> But I must
<GOOD> I have to use Hammer
<GOOD> SnS is lucky in comparison
<GOOD> Spin roar spin spin spin fly roar
<GOOD> Although probably more fly than spin
<GOOD> Oh and charge can't forget charge
<GOOD> I'm just going all in on raw
<GOOD> I just got my Ahtal Ka hammer and that's the best I'm getting till Crimson Fatalis
<GOOD> Maybe but I don't have any good water hammers
<GOOD> Esp because I just got to HR Break
<GOOD> I'm saving the alluring gem I somehow got from my first Ahtal Ka clear for a different weapon like GS tho
<GOOD> Isn't Savage Deviljho a subspecies
<GOOD> And the gold Rajang I haven't fought that yet
<GOOD> And like, the Gore Magala subspecies and Raging Brachy etc
<GOOD> Furious Rajang he was literally already like that
<GOOD> What, the tail?
<GOOD> Is it still able to power down
<GOOD> Ok so like I may have already fought this dude
<GOOD> Because I beat regular Rajang without breaking the tail
<GOOD> Does Crimson and Old Fatalis count as a subspecies
<GOOD> What is Fatalis' deal anyway vro
<GOOD> Like fuck off he looks so angry
<GOOD> Stupid dragon I'm gonna beat it to death with hammers
<GOOD> Stupid dragon fake ass final boss can't even pilot a mech made out of castle schrade
<GOOD> I thought the dragons did that out of necessity not hate
<GOOD> Then made themselves into beasts as penance for wiping the floor with the ancients
<GOOD> Stupid Fatalis I'm gonna kill it with hammers to prove it wrong
<GOOD> And then make a tower out of Fatalis parts
<GOOD> Do you mean it's canon u don't kill any monster or just fatalis
<GOOD> I thought the quest was to slay Fatalis
<GOOD> Like I think a dragonator to the face and then carving up its corpse should kill it
<GOOD> Idk man Lao Shan Lung seemed pretty dead
<GOOD> If he isn't I ruined his whole damn life
<GOOD> No claws no horns cracked back broken skull
<GOOD> I don't think these dragons are as smart as the other ones, just an inkling of suspicion
<GOOD> What do I know maybe Old Fatalis wiped out the ancients by walking in a straight line towards them and then slowly attacking their village for 50 minutes
<GOOD> In GU it doesn't seem like that big a deal that I kill the elder dragons I hunt
<GOOD> Like is there not more kushala daora unfortunately
<GOOD> I haven't fought it yet
<GOOD> I assumed it was just Fatalis but it did more damage because this is old gen Fatalis
<GOOD> Is Ahtal Ka dead
<GOOD> Like did I actually beat that one to death
<GOOD> Kirin is just a horse I don't see the difference
<GOOD> But like those elder dragons seem pretty dead why aren't they just repelled in game
<GOOD> It just requires a different victory animation
<GOOD> Yeah but the elder dragons can just flee when you kill them
<GOOD> Yeah I know about that
<GOOD> Dos has it too afaik
<GOOD> Ok but do you even kill them at the end
<GOOD> Like are they canon dead
<GOOD> Or are they still just hurt or whatever
<GOOD> That's stupid what
<GOOD> Dead but doesn't die but also dies on screen and you carve up its corpse
<GOOD> If an anthill tore off my skin and started breaking my fingers slowly then I'd probably not keep going
<GOOD> Or at least swat them
<GOOD> Also this is 1 ant
<GOOD> If 1 ant was tearing the skin off my back, ripping my nails off and then knocking me out and tearing pieces off me to take back to the anthill I'd be horrified
<GOOD> Were they an idiot or something
<GOOD> Lao Shan Lung has not historically done this
<GOOD> Again if ants were breaking my skull I would indeed go ballistic
<GOOD> Why would it be going easy on you lol
<GOOD> If ants could do that to me I would probably kill them immediately
<GOOD> Especially if it happens every time I meet an ant
<GOOD> I would flip my shit
<GOOD> Is being stabbed in the abdomen with 4 giant harpoons a big deal
<GOOD> Or maybe getting the giant rotating harpoon in your eye
<GOOD> Or like, the giant fucking cannon that creates an explosion larger than you
<GOOD> (You being Lao)
<GOOD> I think if ants could set off bombs I would flip my shit
<GOOD> Lao Shan Lung may be stupid
<GOOD> So like what does Lao Shan Lung do when we don't kill him or whatever
<GOOD> Does he go home
<GOOD> He literally can't
<GOOD> I'm starting to believe just painting a fake mountain pass would cause him to smash his head against the cliff until he passed out
<GOOD> Yeah but when you kill him he collapses
<GOOD> So in canon does he just turn around somehow
<GOOD> There is no around
<GOOD> Also his gigantic ass can't turn around in that narrow ass Area 2 tbh
<GOOD> Softlocked
<GOOD> They should just move the city there I think
<GOOD> Maybe the humans and Lao are stupid
<GOOD> I think if he was very powerful and old he would just take the alternate path anyway
<GOOD> Or just climb over the wall
<GOOD> He just kinda, doesn't really attempt to even go wherever he's going he just really likes the path that he's dead set on
<GOOD> He's a migratory animal that's about it
<GOOD> This is the case but also just kill all of them if it bothers him that much
<GOOD> Does Lao actually have like, elder dragon powers
<GOOD> I'm inclined to believe his power is that he's a giant and slow moving target
<GOOD> I mean apparently you've informed me in MH that isn't too remarkable
<GOOD> I wonder what would happen if you like, fully dismantled a Kirin and ate it or smth
<GOOD> Would it still come back
<GOOD> Just knock it out
<GOOD> Good ending
<GOOD> Kushala daora too they should have made more of those towers
<GOOD> The dodo is .... Lost media...?
<GOOD> But yeah I think Elder Dragons could afford to be a little bit smarter
<GOOD> They're letting down the team
<GOOD> Anyway if anyone wants to suffer with me and kill Siverlos tomorrow lmk if not I'm sleeping and finding strangers to drag into hell
<GOOD> It was over 2 years
<GOOD> He had a backlog of videos that carried him to 6 months ago
<GOOD> So he could remain financially stable
<GOOD> Or at least keep making money
<GOOD> Idk that's what I've heard
<GOOD> He had like a whole NSFW page going on and was destroying his body, I don't think it was a bit
<GOOD> And if so it's a very very dangerous bit
<GOOD> Like, he's probably still not fully well after losing the weight
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I don't really understand how it's a bit
<GOOD> Like what's the punchline
<GOOD> Me when I ruin my life so people can laugh at me
<GOOD> That's not a bit then
<GOOD> It's like a very vague plan at best
<GOOD> I respect his journey to losing his weight but he made a complete joke out of himself on purpose
<GOOD> I mean that's a fairly awful payoff
<GOOD> If it's his plan then sure but it's uh
<GOOD> Certainly a different plan
<GOOD> Like yeah people would talk about me the rest of my life if I ate the Mona Lisa
<GOOD> But as a dumbass that ate the Mona lisa
<GOOD> Yeah but the Mona Lisa is THE painting
<GOOD> I feel like if someone did in fact take a bite out of the most famous painting ever they'd be known for a while
<GOOD> Filming myself mukbanging the Mona Lisa
<GOOD> People have already forgotten about Nikocado and it's been a day lol
<GOOD> The thing is that like, at the end of the day you have still ruined your health for money
<GOOD> And people will remember him as the dumbass man baby or the dude who pretended to be a dumbass man baby for multiple years
<GOOD> On a personal level I imagine it is
<GOOD> Like losing weight is healthy at that weight, but his arteries are probably still suffering
<GOOD> If the tradeoff was 30 years off my life I wouldn't
<GOOD> Yeah but what if you were gonna live to 60 in the first place lol
<GOOD> My nan died at 60 from heart complications, it ain't a bit to fuck around with your organs
<GOOD> Removing my own kidneys for content!!!
<GOOD> That's why I said kidneys
<GOOD> Plural
<GOOD> Also I didn't say someone else removed them
<GOOD> Doing awful stuff for content is just shit in general lol
<GOOD> I understand the ouroboros of content creation but like, it's pathetic
<GOOD> Killing yourself for profit on a personal level is truly idiotic
<GOOD> Yeah you have money, no dignity, no health, no time to enjoy it
<GOOD> I mean you'd be worse off than now that's kinda the point
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Unless his husband was also part of the lie
<GOOD> I struggle with crippling mental shit daily too, it's not an underestimation
<GOOD> If I sacrificed the little I had for content then I'd have money and nothing else
<GOOD> Was his boyfriend also doing the bit bc he mukbanged with him
<GOOD> Yeah I understand that, it's how weird amoral billionaires are the only ones that exist
<GOOD> Uh huh
<GOOD> It's like, slightly true? Maybe?
<GOOD> But tbh if I had money I'd probably still be alone
<GOOD> And miserable
<GOOD> Well I'm actually not that alone recently
<GOOD> But like I can't cure my mental issues they're a part of me
<GOOD> They won't go away if I throw money around, at best I can make peace with it but like eh
<GOOD> Then why are billionaires like Musk and Rowling constantly embittered and miserable
<GOOD> You'd think they could cure that
<GOOD> Because yk, money solves it
<GOOD> Yeah but if billionaires know anything it's how to throw money at problems
<GOOD> I'd visit aquariums
<GOOD> But yk I can visit the aquarium right now so
<GOOD> Also the thing is that most people without money are like well surely I won't give up my dignity and morals and then they have money and they do
<GOOD> Because they can talk from an ivory tower instead of actually having issues
<GOOD> It's also just the mitigation of issues that comes with money, although again I doubt my mental issues would actually be solved if I threw money at it
<GOOD> So why would I destroy myself for money
<GOOD> It's strange bc a lot of people seem to be
<GOOD> A billion is an unfathomable amount of money so that checks out
<GOOD> Hey 1 lick for a thou? My tongue has tasted worse
<GOOD> It's moreso mental health issues and no money, or mental health issues, physical health issues and possibly worse for money
<GOOD> Like I can't enjoy that money if I'm in a state where I can't do cool shit
<GOOD> Idk man I feel like everyone would be different if they got that much money, as much as I'd wanna say otherwise
<GOOD> No one is immune to the corruption that comes with being able to completely ignore every issue
<GOOD> I'd definitely have my imposter syndrome flare up like crazy if I had money
<GOOD> Like no trust for anyone I meet after gaining it, just in case
<GOOD> Plus like:
Be rich
Friends still struggling
Give money to friends
Now I'm surrounded by rich people
<GOOD> It's very easy to have a rich bubble
<GOOD> If I had 1 billion dollars, 1 million dollars is only 1/1000th of that
<GOOD> And 1 million is rich
<GOOD> 1 million is very much rich
<GOOD> If I have some on me yea
<GOOD> Although I usually carry like, 20 in 2 notes in cash
<GOOD> That doesn't make you not rich
<GOOD> To be fair I also grew up in a place where almost every homeless person in my area lived in a house
<GOOD> No like, they owned stuff and had money
<GOOD> BC I assumed it was different elsewhere
<GOOD> Like Birmingham area is indeed, a shithole
<GOOD> I'm nervous to talk to strangers so I thought giving money was better than nothing
<GOOD> 500 cigarettes
<GOOD> Oh my god I saw a dude smoke meat with 500 cigarettes the other day
<GOOD> It was vile lmao
<GOOD> What I would do with a billion dollars:
1. All in on black
2. ???
<GOOD> I'd buy a lifetime pass to an aquarium even if one doesn't exist
<GOOD> Like just donate a ton of money till they're like ok you can visit for free
<GOOD> Our city government is almost bankrupt
<GOOD> Is there like a safe shot of something they'd want
<GOOD> The thing with food is like what if they don't like the food
<GOOD> Or I buy the wrong size clothes
<GOOD> Like waaa
<GOOD> Does my local supermarket even have a clothing section actually
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure the Asda does but that's far away
<GOOD> Morrisons and Lidl don't
<GOOD> Except in the middle aisle but buying clothes from Lidl is gonna be dicey
<GOOD> Plus like, clothes are expensive and I'm a greedy bastard I fear
<GOOD> Like can we have cheap basic clothes I'd buy many of them
<GOOD> I don't hand out 20s
<GOOD> The only cash I carry is 20 of like, emergency money
<GOOD> If I have other money on me I give it
<GOOD> But I don't think I can afford 20 per person while I'm unemployed
<GOOD> Fuck it w/e I feel ass for some reason now
<GOOD> 500 cigarettes
<GOOD> Well yeah I do in fact feel ass that I can't help more homeless people because I'm greedy as shit and can't talk to people I don't know
<GOOD> But like idk there's just something else
<GOOD> Being uncharitable lol
<GOOD> Like, I'm not helping anyone by giving them pocket change and I can't help them because I can't talk to them and ask what they need
<GOOD> I usually just give food I can't/won't eat to flatmates
<GOOD> If we aren't including bursaries/student loan, 2000 that I'm not touching if possible
<GOOD> Because it was from a saving account that my nan donated to and I could never spend it tbh
<GOOD> If I can help it
<GOOD> For now I'm living off maintenance loans because I'm on my course
<GOOD> I am aware
<GOOD> I don't live beyond my means but I'm unemployed so I can't help anyone anyway
<GOOD> This sounds like one of those instagram finance bros posts
<GOOD> Well no because giving things is just for self satisfaction in the end anyway
<GOOD> I didn't consider that people would spend it on something harmful
<GOOD> I just thought they'd use it to buy things for themselves that help
<GOOD> Like oh I'm so nice I gave someone like 2
<GOOD> If I was suddenly down on my luck I'd probably be dead lol
<GOOD> I'm struggling as is but whatever
<GOOD> I feel like I have a bit more to go before then but I'm going up rn
<GOOD> So I hope it doesn't plummet again
<GOOD> Look I'm just being honest
<GOOD> I don't have survival instinct
<GOOD> I don't have a job now let alone without phone access
<GOOD> Or without a home or anything
<GOOD> I truly won't
<GOOD> I still have nothing on my CV
<GOOD> Yeah that's what I'm saying
<GOOD> I can't even work retail because I have uni hours and I live in a fairly crowded place for students
<GOOD> It's rural Wales but there's a high density of students
<GOOD> Therefore there's no jobs because I'm a dime a dozen
<GOOD> I could volunteer and join societies which I have done
<GOOD> But now I gotta get committee roles so I can put that as like, experience
<GOOD> Or volunteer for actual things like beach cleans
<GOOD> Plus like I'm still fucking with depression constantly
<GOOD> Sometimes it's a struggle to eat let alone take a step to volunteer
<GOOD> It's just like, a rough spot lol
<GOOD> And I'm wasting time as we speak by not doing it
<GOOD> My dad wanted me to work directly out of school, he probably would lose his shit at anything after uni tbh
<GOOD> I think he wanted me to be a bricklayer, a marine or get a degree and be an electrician
<GOOD> All of which are boooooring
<GOOD> I don't think I'm built for war somehow
<GOOD> Yeah he made that clear
<GOOD> But like I wouldn't be good at it
<GOOD> I don't enjoy it, couldn't focus
<GOOD> No but I did engineering as an A level
<GOOD> Marine bio is the only thing I wanna do, I'd probably do alright in a shit supermarket job if I could get one tho
<GOOD> Although to be honest I can't lie in interviews yet so
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> I think this year is the most fun I've ever had in education
<GOOD> why do you want this job
<GOOD> I'm a terrible liar
<GOOD> No job
<GOOD> Employers want you there forever
<GOOD> They don't want you to gain experience there they want you to be there as long as possible
<GOOD> Yeah that's why they take more desperate applicants
<GOOD> Praying for Lidl to take me because it's literally across the street from my accommodation
<GOOD> Less than 1 minute commute
<GOOD> My CV is blank as we speak
<GOOD> See I don't know how to do that
<GOOD> I'm not an embellisher
<GOOD> I just attempt to say what I mean
<GOOD> Oh I'm a people pleaser lol
<GOOD> I can do that forever
<GOOD> Like I'm not egotistical but I've spent the last 3 months with a person with the shortest most unreasonable and loud fuse I've ever met
<GOOD> And I haven't looked visibly upset in front of him the whole time
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Like I think I'd actually be aight at a supermarket but in an interview I genuinely find stacking shelves interesting enough to keep doing it is not flying
<GOOD> It's a job interview
<GOOD> Oh that's a good one
<GOOD> It's short and true
<GOOD> Hardest interview question I've been asked is what Yu-Gi-Oh deck I play
<GOOD> I didn't get that job
<GOOD> Toons
<GOOD> And Dinos but I played Toons back then
<GOOD> Toons are cute but they're kinda shit and at best an annoyance
<GOOD> Also oddly I do genuinely think I'd enjoy retail jobs, at least usually
<GOOD> Apologise and do nothing lol
<GOOD> I'm literally made to be yelled at without repercussions
<GOOD> I mean that's how a job works
<GOOD> You do what people tell you and be agreeable for money
<GOOD> Not an option
<GOOD> I wish I could be a house enby
<GOOD> That would be fun
<GOOD> But I'll never have the money to live comfortably in my life with my career so
<GOOD> Also it's long distance and we're both unemployed so lol
<GOOD> Plus I don't rely on people
<GOOD> Why do I have these conversations they always ruin my day
<GOOD> Yeah but some people still have stability
<GOOD> Like once my course ends that's kinda it
<GOOD> My dad's already made it clear behind my back that he thinks I'm gonna fail and be a leech so I'm never relying on this place
<GOOD> If I'm still around
<GOOD> I don't think Wales is getting nuked
<GOOD> Fatalis
<GOOD> Oh that's so good
<GOOD> I'm clunky with enby equivalents of words
<GOOD> Like have u ever seen people try and use an enby equivalent of GF/BF that isn't partner
<GOOD> I saw someone suggesting hugfriend and like, I don't think this is working out
<GOOD> Yeah I always make up words
<GOOD> One of my favourite words is frenby even if it's pointless because friend is gender neutral
<GOOD> Yaaaa
<GOOD> Oh and I'm never having kids but a word for an enby parent too
<GOOD> Like do you just say parent
<GOOD> Theyfriend makes me
<GOOD> Yeaaaa that's what we do
<GOOD> My partner calls me a lover because she likes the word more
<GOOD> I just saw someone suggest Datemate
<GOOD> It sounds like an edate app
<GOOD> I don't think I like ones like that unless there's a specific one I really like that I haven't found yet
<GOOD> Also speaking of, an online friend suggested a name to me but now I lowkey really like it
<GOOD> It is a tad extra tho
<GOOD> Yeah a name
<GOOD> They said Asther was a nice name and something sparked in my head but like
<GOOD> It's so high fantasy
<GOOD> I get called pookie
<GOOD> Haiiiii
<GOOD> Oooo nice
<GOOD> Oh dear
<GOOD> Waow hyper silver Rathalos is comically unplaytested
<GOOD> Not buying
<GOOD> Still hyperfixated on mh
<GOOD> But ty
<GOOD> Guys
<GOOD> Do y'all fw millionaire's shortbread
<GOOD> My favourite food
<GOOD> Caramel
<GOOD> The bottom layer is shortbread
<GOOD> Although usually the caramel layer is thinner
<GOOD> It's regular shortbread
<GOOD> Somewhere in the middle is scottie dog shortbread
<GOOD> Not because it tastes better but because it's shaped like a dog
<GOOD> It isssss
<GOOD> I wanna make shortbread
<GOOD> Mola mola are universally dunked on by marine biologists
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It's quite funny everyone ik on my course and everyone I've told about them dunks on them
<GOOD> Furfrou pharaoh trim
<GOOD> They're in very high demand
<GOOD> Do they have the dormant Xerneas
<GOOD> Or just regular
<GOOD> I need to buy Monster Hunter plushies
<GOOD> Possibly because they're incredibly overdesigned
<GOOD> Who could have known this
<GOOD> $50 on travel expenses????
<GOOD> I just sit in my house and catch what pops up
<GOOD> Like in MHNow
<GOOD> Oh my god I had to beat the entire Village in MHGU just for 1 item
<GOOD> It's finally over
<GOOD> Greatsword build almost done
<GOOD> Fnaf
<GOOD> I scream when I see Roxanne Wolf
<GOOD> But the scream sounds like WOWEEEEEE! And my eyes pop out of my skull and I hit myself on the head with a hammer and I wolf whistle and my head turns into a steaming kettle
<GOOD> She is but it's funny
<GOOD> Nedd bear
<GOOD> Kill
<GOOD> Kill
<GOOD> SOLO HYPER SILVER RATHALOS WITH HAMMER DONE
<GOOD> Toe sucking chat
<GOOD> Might start MHRise
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Our DMs are open yk you can message anytime
<GOOD> I heard Rise is much easier
<GOOD> We shall see
<GOOD> Honestly after HyperSlos I'm excited to do something that won't lead to me dying before 30 from stress
<GOOD> Why are they limited time
<GOOD> That is stupid
<GOOD> At least romping through World is gonna be easy when I do that
<GOOD> Well I'm glad I can mod it
<GOOD> Also yay
<GOOD> Splatfest weekend
<GOOD> Yea ik
<GOOD> I love cider sometimes
<GOOD> Wouldn't crying in VR goggles mess with the lenses and the fabric around it
<GOOD> I mean yeah I have indeed done so, or at least an equivalent
<GOOD> But fair point
<GOOD> I like regular chocolate chip
<GOOD> Rise is not running
<GOOD> Well it's running very poorly
<GOOD> It appears my GPU has too much to handle
<GOOD> Sproke
<GOOD> New anti woke game just dropped (it's mediocre)
<GOOD> Dipped
<GOOD> Dipper
<GOOD> I'm dying in GU
<GOOD> In general
<GOOD> Like I'm dying irl
<GOOD> But today the one that annoyed me was Savage + Hyper Jho
<GOOD> I had to get ppl to help
<GOOD> I'm killing Rustrazor Ceanataur
<GOOD> I should get a job but uni schedule is gonna interrupt it
<GOOD> Yeah but harder to find one
<GOOD> Plus I've joined a few clubs!!!
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I finally reached the point where I actually need to kill Fatalis for a build
<GOOD> Oh dear
<GOOD> Landing a GP
<GOOD> Vanilla
<GOOD> God Fortnite skins this season are awesome in variety, from a hawk to a crossover
<GOOD> Sawk tuah
<GOOD> Sawk Throah
<GOOD> Pokmon PREDICTED best meme of 2024???
<GOOD> I'm bored so I'm bingeing AVGN from the start
<GOOD> Bro I wanna consume Shadow content so badly
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Idrc about the other guys except Omega and sometimes Sonic
<GOOD> It's all Shadow
<GOOD> I'm undiagnosed and I like Sonic a bit
<GOOD> But again I'm just drawn to Shadow for no reason
<GOOD> Also does putting 100+ hours into smth over the span of like 2 weeks and being unable to think about other stuff count as a hyperfixation
<GOOD> Like 100 hrs in game but I spend out of game time planning for when I play the game
<GOOD> I might
<GOOD> Still undiagnosed tho
<GOOD> Depression feels like a bit of a lock tho
<GOOD> I yapped to my partner so much about MH they made their discord nickname their favourite MH monster :3
<GOOD> I really wanna play more Animal Crossing tbh
<GOOD> I need a break from deviant grinding in GU or I'll never escape
<GOOD> I love SCPs
<GOOD> I wanna learn more about it tbhtbh
<GOOD> My horror thing of choice to talk to ppl about constantly is fnaf tho
<GOOD> Zinogre after standing still and being a completely free target for the billionth time
<GOOD> I can't fight deviants no more
<GOOD> Redhelm will drain my life force
<GOOD> I get listened to by my partner but she doesn't know wtf I'm saying because yes
<GOOD> Like I wouldn't expect fnaf lore to be easy to follow but I'm bad at it still
<GOOD> He only comes back twice
<GOOD> In current canon
<GOOD> He comes back once when he becomes springtrap and a second time when he survives the Fazbear's Frights fire
<GOOD> So he really only came back like once, he didn't come back the second time he just survived a fire
<GOOD> Then Glitchtrap and Burntrap aren't Afton
<GOOD> So he doesn't come back
<GOOD> He's still getting tortured by Cassidy
<GOOD> Is this pre Ruin
<GOOD> If so it may be outdated for HW oneards
<GOOD> DLC for Security Breach
<GOOD> It may be accurate then
<GOOD> Unless it still does the Glitchtrap is Afton's remnant theory
<GOOD> Cuz the current theory that holds water and makes more sense than Afton Remnant is the Mimic program
<GOOD> Which makes perfect sense now that we know The Mimic is canon to the games
<GOOD> Sleep Assurance meter like Tyke and Son's!!!!!
<GOOD> Erm what if you fell asleep to a tape player playing relaxing music under ur bed
<GOOD> But Monster Rat can break your tape player causing you to need to rewind it in order to continue playing it
<GOOD> While monster cat sits there useless because he sucks
<GOOD> Oh Groudon gunpla
<GOOD> That's sick
<GOOD> You didn't
<GOOD> That's very cool
<GOOD> I couldn't get one
<GOOD> I thought so
<GOOD> So like is there smth I can wear that is like earplugs but doesn't fall out instantly and I can still sleep in
<GOOD> Earplugs (Monster Hunter reference)
<GOOD> Hunter playing the magic song that makes all your friends somehow immune to loud noises
<GOOD> Local 58 is a good one
<GOOD> Vita Carnis is also a good one because it actually shows stuff with tons of practical props
<GOOD> The fnaf analog horror series is good too but it leans less into the concept being scary and just showing it in scary ways
<GOOD> Is it the watch the trees one
<GOOD> Ahhh I haven't seen this one
<GOOD> I saw a random video essay on a Minecraft PS1 series
<GOOD> Consuming horror through analysis and reactions because it's bad for my heart to watch horror alone
<GOOD> This is a replica of Andy's room from toy story
<GOOD> Oooo I'm putting this to watch later
<GOOD> The only clip I watched of a game like that was some dude screaming because a snake creature with a human head was slowly following him
<GOOD> God DanTDM is so awesome
<GOOD> Bro this horror iceberg is so funny the dude is so done
<GOOD> He keeps saying like this isn't a horror game idk why it's here and saying he wants to rush the top layers because they're boring
<GOOD> I love it when they do this bc like same dude
<GOOD> I don't think that's the video essay I watched
<GOOD> Although this one is mostly another recap-then-theorise style essay
<GOOD> Yet again the The {adjective} {noun} of {franchise} title format ensnares me
<GOOD> This vid is mostly them talking about then playing the modpack and watching the video series attached to it
<GOOD> I need to style my hair different at some point
<GOOD> It is possible to make ur hair part down the middle instead of the side right
<GOOD> Mine parts to the side rn
<GOOD> Ble
<GOOD> My hair was a bit messy here bc it just got brushed and blow dried
<GOOD> I always feel weird when my selfies invert idk why
<GOOD> Inverting things is just weird
<GOOD> Like when ppl invert fnaf cameras
<GOOD> But yas maybe I should change my hair too
<GOOD> And everything about myself frfr
<GOOD> Ur  hair is so cool omg
<GOOD> I thought the video was gonna be Persona 1 ngl
<GOOD> I love these videos
<GOOD> The well done screen having no Victory tune is so funny idk why
<GOOD> Also I bought these knives from a local market expecting them to be average bc they were cheap but these things are super fancy and good asf
<GOOD> Like apparently they're folded Japanese steel and they cut through everything so easy
<GOOD> Omg I'm just like Samurai frfr....
<GOOD> Wii shop
<GOOD> But yea these knives are huge too
<GOOD> I got 3 and a random steak knife
<GOOD> Ok nvm they are german steel
<GOOD> Born hater
<GOOD> This thing is so huge man like what do I need a knife this big for
<GOOD> I actually have a growing Kuromi collection
<GOOD> I heart piracy
<GOOD> I've recently fell into an addiction of minecraft videos where ppl download a shitton of bloated mods at once to make the game confusing and unplayable
<GOOD> Like the horror mods
<GOOD> If I ever made my hair shorter I'd want it like the BotW Link pixie cut
<GOOD> People still running Dark Magician in 2024
<GOOD> DM is not viable
<GOOD> People swear up and down that DM is viable in comp tho
<GOOD> See that's what I've been thinking
<GOOD> I've found myself saying I'm just a girlie a lot more recently actually
<GOOD> #nooticing
<GOOD> Idk why I say that I find it kind of funny
<GOOD> My partner calls us yuri even tho they're genderfluid and I'm nb
<GOOD> Idk what to monster hunt
<GOOD> I used to use Performapals
<GOOD> Like not pends just Performapals
<GOOD> I did want to use Frightfurs yes
<GOOD> Idk whether to start a different MH Game or keep grinding GU
<GOOD> I can't run 5th gen :((
<GOOD> My GPU is in dire need of an upgrade but idk how to upgrade it
<GOOD> Or what GPU to get
<GOOD> Ao Oni
<GOOD> AMD Radeon rx6400 4gb
<GOOD> I don't know how to move stuff around in my PC tho
<GOOD> Like I've only installed RAM so far
<GOOD> A GPU is scary
<GOOD> She's long distance also she doesn't
<GOOD> Idk probably like uhhhh
<GOOD> 70-80
<GOOD> But I can save up
<GOOD> Lovely
<GOOD> PCs piss me offffff
<GOOD> Like waow I can have something with the power of a Nintendo switch
<GOOD> (it costs more than a Nintendo switch to buy 1 part of the PC)
<GOOD> Chat imma play the Edgeworth game tomorrow
<GOOD> What if it was Phawket Mortuahs
<GOOD> PYORO IS BACK
<GOOD> Naw
<GOOD> He's back
<GOOD> Isn't there that fnaf 2 port
<GOOD> Or remake
<GOOD> For roblox
<GOOD> Ah okok
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh dear imma need to invest a little soon
<GOOD> I'm investing in stuff for the ocean, Sophie
<GOOD> Like waders and stuff
<GOOD> And waterproof bags and a snood maybe
<GOOD> My lecturer recommends plastic bags, nitrile gloves, a cap, a snood and everything waterproof
<GOOD> Or waders if I wanna invest early
<GOOD> (I might)
<GOOD> Chat talk to me rn
<GOOD> Please
<GOOD> About anything
<GOOD> I think that unburden is
<GOOD> Funny
<GOOD> Crazy how from gen 6 to 7 we went from a hawk to a Toucan
<GOOD> Real hawks tuah......
<GOOD> The thing is phonetically hawk tuah doesn't sound like it's written
<GOOD> I'm still on digital
<GOOD> I don't have any traditional drawing supplies except regular pencils here
<GOOD> I HATE THIS FLAT I HATE THIS FLAT
<GOOD> FUXK
<GOOD> Ok nvm can't fucking sleep
<GOOD> Paranoia too bad
<GOOD> I hear breathing
<GOOD> Chandelure too
<GOOD> WHY IS MY WINDOW BANGING :(((
<GOOD> I need to continue Edgeworth game tomorrow
<GOOD> If I can fucking SLEEP
<GOOD> This is a FNAC 3 reference
<GOOD> I'm joking btw
<GOOD> It's a rock
<GOOD> I like Iron Bundle
<GOOD> To describe fart (boy)
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I'm listening to the Magnus Archives
<GOOD> It's fun
<GOOD> Bol Sadguy
<GOOD> Gastrodon
<GOOD> I lub Gastrodon it's in the running for my favourites
<GOOD> I need to make mine
<GOOD> Watching the state of play rn I hope they reveal a game
<GOOD> I bet they're gonna remaster Bloodborne
<GOOD> This time
<GOOD> LMFAOOOO PALWORLD TRAILER
<GOOD> Playstation state of play
<GOOD> They just revealed a Sonic x Shadow trailer so cool ig
<GOOD> I came here for games and instead I got Palworld :((
<GOOD> I saw
<GOOD> Yaaaa shame I can't run it
<GOOD> Looks sick as hell but for now we continue grinding on MHFZZ
<GOOD> Omg industry plant game
<GOOD> Something artificially placed/inflated by an industry
<GOOD> Like a game that no one talked about and then suddenly is just spiked in media coverage and nobody you know actually talks about it
<GOOD> Or a streamer or smth
<GOOD> Horizon zero dawn remastered is still such a stupid idea
<GOOD> I also forgot stellar blade existed
<GOOD> Notice how they're advertising a PS5 instead of a game...
<GOOD> It looks ok
<GOOD> Is this another fucking ghost of Tsushima
<GOOD> I meant another bc Sony seem to publish a disproportionate amount of games where you play as a samurai in feudal japan
<GOOD> Oh that was literally it lmao
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I can't run wilds still wass
<GOOD> Waaaa
<GOOD> I hope I can run sonic x shadow
<GOOD> Are you running it on PS5 or smth
<GOOD> Damn you must have spent thousands on it
<GOOD> That's cool
<GOOD> That doesn't sound right
<GOOD> At least for running Wilds
<GOOD> That sounds like a disproportionately low amount to run the game
<GOOD> 2000 dollars is a lot
<GOOD> But that sounds more realistic than 600
<GOOD> Not really just curt bc you were rude
<GOOD> Mine is crap but idgaf for now
<GOOD> Although a GPU is tempting
<GOOD> I have one of these
<GOOD> I can officially run 1/3 of wilds
<GOOD> Tbh my backlog is so big that I can just play some other shit
<GOOD> For 10 years because dear lord
<GOOD> My screen tears while running Rise lmao
<GOOD> I can't play it
<GOOD> Doesn't seem to
<GOOD> Also it just lags in general because my GPU is ass
<GOOD> Can't wait to fight this thing in MHFZZ
<GOOD> It's so funny 8 year old me would fw Unknown
<GOOD> It's literally called Unknown
<GOOD> Because it's oooo scary and cool and mysterious
<GOOD> (it definitely is)
<GOOD> It also has the worst render ever
<GOOD> Khezu I will forever hate you especially Zenith Khezu
<GOOD> I haven't fought it yet
<GOOD> The eating attack is actually an instakill for Zenith Khezu
<GOOD> Not joking
<GOOD> First game....
<GOOD> This is me with the PS1/2 game stock at my local CEX
<GOOD> They have so many PS2 games that there's a shelf just for them
<GOOD> They never have Monster Hunter
<GOOD> Shadow the hedgehog PS2 is still in my local CEX I really wanna buy it
<GOOD> Idek what the best version of that game is
<GOOD> That's surprising
<GOOD> That makes more sense
<GOOD> It runs worse?? Bro they had it running on the GC
<GOOD> I think I can run PS2 at a stable rate
<GOOD> MGS3 kinda dropped a bit during cutscenes iirc
<GOOD> But MGS3 is a fairly intensive PS2 game
<GOOD> (also it's peak)
<GOOD> Xbox series X just about getting ahead of the technical curve
<GOOD> I wonder how I can stream switch stuff on discord etc
<GOOD> Apparently it's not too hard
<GOOD> Oh that's a lot nvm
<GOOD> Imma go to cex after browsing the university societies
<GOOD> And peruse
<GOOD> I like the word peruse
<GOOD> Yeaaaa but yk it's expensive for what I'd use it for BC I'm not an actual streamer
<GOOD> So that's too bad I can stream other stuff
<GOOD> Imma get some cheap horror games and stream them in October
<GOOD> Ao Oni is on the list
<GOOD> Ahhhh I hate being undiagnosed with anything because it minimises what I feel
<GOOD> Grahhhh
<GOOD> Nawr this was about saying the word depression
<GOOD> I'm not diagnosed with anything
<GOOD> But it's like man I feel it
<GOOD> I thought about my life critically for 10 whole minutes today and cried
<GOOD> And it used to be worse
<GOOD> Missing meals and worrying about my grades bc of Monster Hunter is perfectly neurotypical I fear
<GOOD> I didn't go to that extreme during my Kirby binging but I missed meals and stopped doing maintenance and slept a fair bit less
<GOOD> Trying to think about revision for marine biology but my brain slots in monster hunter combine recipes
<GOOD> And the charms and decos I need for my mixset
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I think you also sound a bit different while moving with charms slotted
<GOOD> But idk
<GOOD> Plus like I can't get diagnosed anyway
<GOOD> And if I did it would fuck up my chances at a job marginally
<GOOD> Idk if I want a different name
<GOOD> I'm indifferent yeah
<GOOD> Therapy discussion was actually how I started this convo in the first place lol
<GOOD> I slipped and hurt my leg
<GOOD> Someone offered me paracetamol tho which was very nice of them
<GOOD> Is this diskless
<GOOD> The PS2 is 90 waaa
<GOOD> Bro did somebody fucking buy Shadow
<GOOD> I don't have fake nails
<GOOD> My nails look like this, depicted holding Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater
<GOOD> They also have MGS2 for 5
<GOOD> And these ps1 games
<GOOD> Yeah 12
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> The games list man I'm crying
<GOOD> Shenmue, Sonic Adventure, Chu Chu Rocket
<GOOD> with ergonomic controllers while every other little card is gassing up the system #nooticing
<GOOD> The gamecube games btw
<GOOD> Peakiful Joe
<GOOD> To be fair I think I was thinking of Clu Clu Land
<GOOD> Which is an NES game
<GOOD> What the fuck is this lmao
<GOOD> This is the most 18+ game a kid in a cartoon wants game ever
<GOOD> Ok that's hilarious
<GOOD> Is there a restored project for ot
<GOOD> Is it still like, playable
<GOOD> The PS2 games are so cheap btw it's crazy
<GOOD> 5 for one of the best games ever made
<GOOD> So many fifas and smack downs in here
<GOOD> The only person who is mildly geographically close to me in this server is Spoon iirc
<GOOD> I'm north Wales
<GOOD> Yea but Spoon is IN North Wales I think idk
<GOOD> But yea nobody actually needs to go to where I am except for university BC it's rlly remote lol
<GOOD> My parents live in the west midlands
<GOOD> Wolverhampton/Birmingham is the kinda area I lived in
<GOOD> Black Country type shit
<GOOD> Never go to Black Country it sucks
<GOOD> It's mostly a bunch of very financially struggling or closed shops
<GOOD> And a football stadium
<GOOD> My dad is naturally a Wolves fan because of this
<GOOD> Although admittedly Wolverhampton Wanderers is a hard name
<GOOD> Also chat never go to Birmingham
<GOOD> Birmingham is worse
<GOOD> The black country in general is also bad idk if Birmingham is in there tho
<GOOD> Our flag is kinda hard tho
<GOOD> I went to Shrewsbury on a day trip and felt very poor
<GOOD> It's a blast furnace
<GOOD> Yea but this isn't a football club or anything it's just
<GOOD> The area for some reason
<GOOD> Idk why we have a flag
<GOOD> Also did u know the black country is where the industrial revolution started
<GOOD> I'm probably descended from miners
<GOOD> The one
<GOOD> When you buy a house in my home town you have to get a survey in case there's a mineshaft under your home lmao
<GOOD> It's so ass too like, the black country's motto is black by day, red by night cuz there used to be so much soot and smog and shit the sun couldn't break through the sky, and at night the blast furnaces made the horizon red
<GOOD> Like brother do I live in fucking Mordor or England
<GOOD> Dipper
<GOOD> I knew it
<GOOD> Also one of the only stories I know about the area that's not about canals and manufacture is that one time the queen came through during the industrial revolution and she closed her carriage curtain and refused to open it until she left
<GOOD> It's like, a comically awful place
<GOOD> I thought that said slurs
<GOOD> The black country used to be like, a medieval evil realm lol now it's just a bunch of people descended from those people
<GOOD> Birmingham is like Detroit though
<GOOD> I have the happiest man in Birmingham video
<GOOD> Beautiful
<GOOD> I was gonna record me trying to do this but this server doesn't allow voice recording
<GOOD> It's the breathing afterwards
<GOOD> Like he's so mad and I get it
<GOOD> Birmingham is like that
<GOOD> Lmaoooo
<GOOD> also on the flipside there's me trying to impersonate this lne
<GOOD> I love this video
<GOOD> they're going to use this for war kills me
<GOOD> There's another specific british yelling video I'm trying to find where the dude tells people where he lives and threatens them saying if they come round he'll smash their heads in
<GOOD> NOOOOOOOOOOO
<GOOD> This is a vocal stim I have it's horrible
<GOOD> A while ago I had where ya going ya big drip?
<GOOD> The change from awe to fear in the video gets me
<GOOD> The I'm scared just kills me
<GOOD> I think random shitty animation quotes nab me more than most other things
<GOOD> Like I have a hole in my brain
<GOOD> Or no Peter, we're in doki doki literature club
<GOOD> Also this is more of an earworm but I can't stop thinking about it
<GOOD> Bendy was a little devil thing has been in my head for months
<GOOD> I used to play spin ball a lot
<GOOD> It's on PC???
<GOOD> Might cop
<GOOD> Ooooh
<GOOD> Frowny face
<GOOD> /j
<GOOD> jumpscared by hyperfixation
<GOOD> For some reason it made me buy 3D blast and spinball separately
<GOOD> They really wanted me to consciously buy 3D blast
<GOOD> Need tbh
<GOOD> Non steam
<GOOD> OHHHHH MY GOD OH MY GOD
<GOOD> I didn't even know his backstory in full BC I haven't played the game
<GOOD> Got me tearing up
<GOOD> I was wondering about that because like idk shit about Emerl is he meant to be there
<GOOD> I assumed so but like, did that happen in canon retroactively
<GOOD> Because he's like naw the Gun soldiers are here too soon
<GOOD> I do too (I have only read his wiki)
<GOOD> Sonic 3 gonna add a new one to the pile
<GOOD> It's still funny to get a new one
<GOOD> Oh that first one is in my cinema soon I think
<GOOD> I have to play through World again waaaa
<GOOD> At least I can run rise and world now I've optimised
<GOOD> Hell I can run World on High
<GOOD> I've already beaten World I want Iceborne
<GOOD> But I beat World when I was 12 and didn't buy Iceborne on PS4 so now I'm 19 and on PC and we're here
<GOOD> It's ok but replays suck bad
<GOOD> L... Lost media...?
<GOOD> Also I just spent 2 hours doing nothing but watching a 2 hour Minecraft pseudo rp movie
<GOOD> Most locked in I've been in ages
<GOOD> Where does modern MH start
<GOOD> Like are you just referring to World and Rise here
<GOOD> GU is closer but it's a celebration of old MH too so like
<GOOD> I would too which I was confused about
<GOOD> Bc that would be like World is worse than Rise by a large margin
<GOOD> Is 3U classic
<GOOD> That's not an assertion I haven't played Rise
<GOOD> GU is my favourite and I started with World
<GOOD> Being hit in World feels so soft now I'm going back to it
<GOOD> It doesn't register to me
<GOOD> There's like that loud ass crunching noise when you get hit that's missing
<GOOD> Yeah it's lowkey annoying going back to it lol
<GOOD> Scoutflies being a necessity
<GOOD> Also oml there's SO MANY CUTSCENES
<GOOD> I'm trying to rush to get to IB and oh my LORD
<GOOD> Like dude fuck off let me play
<GOOD> Yea that's the nail in the coffin
<GOOD> Bro what is this weird science
<GOOD> I'm on a cafe crawl and this was when I ordered pomegranate and hibiscus tea
<GOOD> I'm glad someone explained it to me
<GOOD> Apparently it's strength of the tea
<GOOD> You push it down at 1, 3 or 5 minutes
<GOOD> It was lovely btw it smelled so fruity and was light but still yummy (I went for medium strength)
<GOOD> Only 3
<GOOD> I gave them 5 tho BC I loved the place sm
<GOOD> Yaaa
<GOOD> The pomegranate was very strong
<GOOD> They also do a bunch of other nice teas I will try
<GOOD> Also the strained tea had no bits in it so 10/10
<GOOD> I'm not even usually a tea person but I might be now
<GOOD> I haven't had it before
<GOOD> Was very nice
<GOOD> Pomegranates are so fire
<GOOD> I like white grapes more but only when they're crunchy
<GOOD> Otherwise red grapes
<GOOD> That caf crawl was lovely
<GOOD> I had to leave 1 stop early tho because they were heading to a Christian caf lmfao
<GOOD> And I think my social battery is too drained to tell people I don't wanna hear bible readings
<GOOD> I wish I was dead actually
<GOOD> This looks like garlic
<GOOD> Bro I struck gold with this cafe
<GOOD> That's crazy for a local business
<GOOD> It's a shame I don't like soup bc they serve lots of soups
<GOOD> Sorry girl, gatekeeping
<GOOD> They're authentic Czech soup and stuff too
<GOOD> It's such a lovely place
<GOOD> Genuinely peak
<GOOD> If I liked Borscht I would cop
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> What is a Babooshka byw
<GOOD> Btw
<GOOD> Ohhhh it's a grandma icic
<GOOD> Oh it's a 100% vegetarian place
<GOOD> I was wondering why the borscht didn't have the meat
<GOOD> I don't think I would eat anything except the cakes from here
<GOOD> Mostly because I'm not a cheese fan tho
<GOOD> Or beets
<GOOD> These monsters better be juiced as fuck man wth is this
<GOOD> Why are we getting so many buffs
<GOOD> I don't like this change at all
<GOOD> I think him making pill shaped speakers as a doctor was pretty awesome looking back
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> I wonder if I should consider upgrading now that games I actually want are coming out after like 5 years
<GOOD> I love my twitter timeline sometimes
<GOOD> Is Chu Chulainn Scottish I don't remember
<GOOD> Or Cliodhna
<GOOD> Straight line
<GOOD> >Consumes Sonic youtube video
>First video is people not understanding a bunch of Sonic lines and calling them ass
<GOOD> Waow I really am in the Sonic fandom
<GOOD> Good arguments happening in the youtube comments
<GOOD> Calling a rhetorical question stupid because they thought Sonic was asking it seriously
<GOOD> The bias was so crazy
<GOOD> From what I watched there was like no Rise of Lyric lines and barely any from Forces
<GOOD> But somehow where ya goin, ya big drip made the worst lines list
<GOOD> my loan came in I can give you money now
<GOOD> Yas
<GOOD> It'll take me a sec btw I barely use paypal
<GOOD> Siiick
<GOOD> Brothership in a month and a half
<GOOD> Real
<GOOD> As a sandbox it's silly
<GOOD> I enjoy
<GOOD> It doesn't leave that effect for you?
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> I was referring to the latter part
<GOOD> BotW feels too padded to not leave that effect
<GOOD> Like yea there's a billion shrines
<GOOD> How fun
<GOOD> This is a standalone discussion tho
<GOOD> Like, as a Standalone game it's better lowkey
<GOOD> A lot of the catacomb stuff does when they decide to continuously repeat midbosses
<GOOD> I've played every other Souls game except Demon's Souls so I know why I like Elden Ring less than them
<GOOD> Does running everywhere feel more fun
<GOOD> Once the novelty runs out that is
<GOOD> Because lowkey when I'm climbing a giant cliff face in the rain for the dozenth time I don't really feel it
<GOOD> I'd rather like, fly up there
<GOOD> I'm bored as shit rn
<GOOD> I'm third wheeling BC I'm waiting for a lecture but my friend is calling her e boyfriend
<GOOD> Seeing the pikmin up there is awesome
<GOOD> And inkling
<GOOD> The curse
<GOOD> I hate having to look at something but people are around so idk where to look because I might look at them by accident
<GOOD> I can't have my eyes closed when I'm just sitting there killing time
<GOOD> So I have to look at something when I'm not looking at my phone
<GOOD> I'm hyperfixated on Parkour Civilization rn and it's embarrassing as shit
<GOOD> One block jump for the chicken....
<GOOD> I was doodling and I randomly drew the Parkour Villain
<GOOD> And it kinda went hard I wanna draw it again
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Idk I like it
<GOOD> PvP civilization a bit worse unfortunately
<GOOD> Imo
<GOOD> It's still aight tho
<GOOD> Also the last bit of my twitter TL is Kagurabachi
<GOOD> I'm also reading Dandadan rn
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> Ok it's gonna take me a sec to explain
<GOOD> So like there's a high school guy who loves cryptids and doesn't believe in yokai, and a high school girl that loves yokai and doesn't believe in cryptids, but then yokai and aliens attack both of them causing the boy to get yokai powers and the girl to get psychic alien powers and also the aliens steal the guy's nuts and they have to get them back
<GOOD> That's the basic premise at least
<GOOD> His nuts get taken by a yokai called Turbo Granny and then she loses them
<GOOD> It's a manga
<GOOD> The art is also consistently insane
<GOOD> So yea it's about cryptids and aliens and ghosts and mechs
<GOOD> It's also constantly weird
<GOOD> Oh and trigger warning for SA if u watch/read it
<GOOD> It's a bit of a hill to get over
<GOOD> Made me very uncomfortable but I don't think it was handled horribly or anything because the characters in question are creepy
<GOOD> Its anime released its first few episodes a few days ago
<GOOD> Mmm they say gross things and it almost happens but they get stopped and have comeuppance
<GOOD> Still disturbing tho
<GOOD> Also the OP is a giant reference to old monster movies and Ultraman it's so cool
<GOOD> It feels like a love letter
<GOOD> It's also just rlly funny and awkward
<GOOD> I mean you can see it from the background style
<GOOD> The comedy style in the anime
<GOOD> And manga
<GOOD> It's very silly and awkward I love it
<GOOD> I mean it has a few episodes out and it gets that bad stuff out of the way (yes it's still uncomfortable but that's kinda the purpose)
<GOOD> It's also apparently phenomenal
<GOOD> I need to watch it
<GOOD> It has 3 eps out rn
<GOOD> Same but work
<GOOD> Well university work
<GOOD> Yea it happens fairly early
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yes I'm waiting for it
<GOOD> Furthermore I already feel the hype dying off for parkour
<GOOD> I think Dandadan is doing it
<GOOD> Why did he lock in sm to draw Obama
<GOOD> Like his art is always good but why
<GOOD> ~~Persona isn't a starting point for that~~
<GOOD> Play Kirby
<GOOD> I would never recommend 64 to someone that's just getting into Kirby
<GOOD> Half because I don't like it and half because it's so WEIRD
<GOOD> Like it's so different to the other games and that isn't bad
<GOOD> I would recommend Robobot, RTDLDX, Forgotten Land or Super Star Ultra
<GOOD> Or Dreamland 3 if they're on my wavelength
<GOOD> What are you referring to
<GOOD> Zero isn't a bad boss tho
<GOOD> Yea but that doesn't make the game worse
<GOOD> All Kirby villains are fucked up
<GOOD> Star Dream literally erases a guy from existence then pilots his corpse
<GOOD> Very cool phase
<GOOD> I'm more suprised they got Elfilis to exist as like, a concept
<GOOD> Or Fecto Forgo in general
<GOOD> This is the same console that Culex was in a Mario game on
<GOOD> That's not comparable rlly
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> The TADC ep just ended
<GOOD> I saved for this I deserve it
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I'm twinning w my friend who has the murder drones notebook
<GOOD> Pomni Jacket
<GOOD> I need pomni hat
<GOOD> >Not Super
<GOOD> YAYYYYY
<GOOD> I'm mad I can't play sparking zero
<GOOD> I need a shopping list for upgrading my PC
<GOOD> I should watch that too ngl
<GOOD> After Dandadan n stuff
<GOOD> Danda
<GOOD> Parkour Civilization
<GOOD> Giant Breadbug
<GOOD> I hate PCs
<GOOD> I'm looking at parts rn and I genuinely have ZERO idea what I'm doing for motherboards
<GOOD> Or most parts in general
<GOOD> Stealing from the MHWilds recommended section
<GOOD> Man I don't have a PC friend anymore
<GOOD> So I can't get PC building help
<GOOD> I need to turn this into this
<GOOD> But idk what motherboard I need and if I need anything except GPU and CPU
<GOOD> Yea but it's also a physical space issue
<GOOD> Will it take that into account if I somehow find what case this is
<GOOD> Alr
<GOOD> Will it already have filtered out every mobo that doesn't work with AMD?
<GOOD> I've put that CPU into the builder already
<GOOD> Okk
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> It says there's a bunch of AMD chipsets does that matter
<GOOD> Also waaa the price is racking up
<GOOD> And I'm afraid of installing all the stuff
<GOOD> Monster hunter wilds
<GOOD> Oh that's it
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I most definitely can't
<GOOD> I'm trying to hit recommended tho just because I want it to be a while before next upgrade
<GOOD> And apparently AMD mobos use the same slots n stuff
<GOOD> I just put the CPU and GPU from recommended in the part picker
<GOOD> And then chose the cheapest listed ATX mobo that apparently fits AMD
<GOOD> Idk if I need to upgrade anything rlse
<GOOD> I wanna play Sparking Zero waaaa
<GOOD> It's 750w so probably
<GOOD> I got it so cheap it's kinda nuts ya
<GOOD> Especially BC it's platinum
<GOOD> I guess I'll make a shopping list and spend some of that money I've saved idk
<GOOD> I got my mom on board but idk what GPU to get because I can't seem to find the one Wilds recommends
<GOOD> Plus idk whether the GPU also has to be compatible with the motherboard
<GOOD> Nvm I can't afford shit I'm giving up and just not spending money
<GOOD> Mm idk whether to play Silent Hill 1 or RE1 or Celeste or FNF
<GOOD> Probably not FNF
<GOOD> The look lmaooo
<GOOD> I played up to where I was on game pass Celeste on steam yesterday (just after the hotel)
<GOOD> I keep missing 1 or 2 strawberries and it pisses me off so bad lmaooo
<GOOD> I'll go back later tho
<GOOD> I haven't tried B sides yet
<GOOD> But yea my sleepy ass brain yesterday was like hey man you might be a girl mind thinking about that? And thought fucking playing Celeste was the solution (I got distracted because it's one of the best platformers I've ever played so far control wise)
<GOOD> I'd just call it an old name but deadname is also applicable
<GOOD> Hmm 12 more days and I can play peak
<GOOD> I really want a Sonic game that controls like Generations does but I can't play Unleashed dies
<GOOD> Idk what games have similar Modern Sonic controls to Generations so
<GOOD> I think it's like, Unleashed and Colours and that's it
<GOOD> And I haven't played Colours in like a decade so idek if that's true
<GOOD> Waaaa I can't afford to keep buying shit
<GOOD> I like how expressive Bowser was
<GOOD> I got reminded Forces exist please help I need resuscitation
<GOOD> No I'm waiting for Shadow
<GOOD> I was gonna replay Mania but it's on my PS4 and I don't have it and I don't want to buy it on PC
<GOOD> Same because I'm fiending got sonic rn
<GOOD> I could play Adventure 1 again and I also forgot I put some random graphic mods on it
<GOOD> Is that mystery character in SxSG even revealed yet
<GOOD> Because at this point I have to assume it's some classic shadow
<GOOD> Forces...
<GOOD> But yea tf was this meant to mean
<GOOD> It's gonna be RETRO Shadow
<GOOD> Made of Voxels
<GOOD> Can't manage football until 2025
<GOOD> I don't have a deadname
<GOOD> Yet
<GOOD> Mhh idk I don't have a massive issue w my current name apart from a little pang, so I probably won't change idk
<GOOD> I heart no access to HRT /s
<GOOD> Literally not getting it in my lifetime
<GOOD> If I want it (I may)
<GOOD> And even if I decide to it's longer from when I apply
<GOOD> I know but you still need official bloodwork
<GOOD> And DIY is less safe
<GOOD> Private
<GOOD> If I win the lottery perhaps
<GOOD> No idea but that's still a lot
<GOOD> Actually not that much ifk
<GOOD> I've never had a health checkup ever
<GOOD> Badge of honour I'm the picture of health
<GOOD> I was actually considering coming out to my parents soon but I had a horrific nightmare last night so haha not happening anytime soon
<GOOD> Not to my knowledge
<GOOD> Unless there's some emergency like when I had tonsillitis or fractured my foot
<GOOD> But those were just like, foot x ray, taking a picture of my eye and ripping my tonsils out so
<GOOD> I'm untested mentally too
<GOOD> Teehee
<GOOD> I chased it up with the university but I made the mistake of appearing to be far better after a session or two because my mental health has constant swings in state
<GOOD> So my therapist just like, stopped responding without multiple emails over a few weeks so eventually I just got forced to give up by my brain
<GOOD> Bettering myself feels lowkey impossible
<GOOD> Or understanding at all
<GOOD> I already talked to my parents about getting checked, you can imagine how that went
<GOOD> Immediately shut down on everything
<GOOD> There's nothing wrong with me, I'm just moody or being a teenager or just being weird
<GOOD> My mom is uneducated, my dad is plain stupid
<GOOD> Attempting to but I've never been taught that kinda stuff because yippee
<GOOD> Like idek how to get a checkup, idek if I can
<GOOD> Cursory check seems uh
<GOOD> Apparently the clinics around here are kinda shit especially for medication unfortunately but I'll have to register ig
<GOOD> I'm really trying
<GOOD> I love having a billion hurdles to jump through on top of my regular fucking life just so I can maybe be happy decades from now when I'm dying
<GOOD> Assuming I'm not already by then
<GOOD> Pyramid Head is Silent Hill I thought
<GOOD> Hi chat check out the amazing dazzling stellar natural beauty oh nooooo am I in the way that's so unfortunate omg
<GOOD> No it's a long exposure pic
<GOOD> And it's not light pollution
<GOOD> My phone is just shitty but it's an aurora
<GOOD> Long exposure doesn't agree with shaky hands sign
<GOOD> Sigh
<GOOD> I actually didn't style it because my brain randomly made me walk to the ocean at almost midnight to take kinda shitty photos
<GOOD> Other actually professional photographers that are students have taken better photos
<GOOD> I should get a phone tripod
<GOOD> Get out of my photos of the inky black void skyline we usually have grrr
<GOOD> It's not even good
<GOOD> It's so messy
<GOOD> I can't make the stray hairs go down
<GOOD> So I look like a crazy scientist
<GOOD> Taken less than 1 minute after washing, blow drying and brushing it btw
<GOOD> So many crazy hairs grr
<GOOD> I suppose I already have a bit of gremlin energy
<GOOD> Also skarm I'm playing SADX again BC I remembered I have it
<GOOD> I got to the Tails plane part and then got possessed to walk almost into the ocean
<GOOD> I did yes
<GOOD> I only installed the recommended mod loader mods tho
<GOOD> Does SA2 have its own one
<GOOD> When I get to that
<GOOD> (I really want to get to that)
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I haven't but I love his design in it
<GOOD> I grew up on Underground and like 2 eps of the one with brown Tails
<GOOD> I wanna watch the one with brown tails too tbh
<GOOD> It has the silly Robotnik
<GOOD> I heard about that
<GOOD> Yoooo
<GOOD> Yeah this one
<GOOD> GYATT
<GOOD> Also I'm playing Sonic Adventure rn
<GOOD> Cries
<GOOD> Just 500 but it takes a bit
<GOOD> They call me Knuckles, unlike Sonic I don't chuckle
<GOOD> I think I wish I was dead I'm almost at the end of Big's story
<GOOD> Amy before this too dies
<GOOD> I think I hate fishes now
<GOOD> I finished Gamma's story and forgot that the robots had the flickeys or whatever inside of them
<GOOD> So I thought it was just
<GOOD> Holy fucking shit this game was peak
<GOOD> I'm installing mods for SA2 rn
<GOOD> Just polish ones tho
<GOOD> Thanks google
<GOOD> I had to stop playing for tonight it's too peak even compared to 1
<GOOD> Yea I saw his lil face but it's so silly
<GOOD> I did Pumpkin Hill before turning it off and I felt rlly stupid
<GOOD> I installed a mod that lets me track all 3 emeralds at once tho
<GOOD> Which helps massively
<GOOD> Also oh my god I played City Escape and I just understood immediately lmao
<GOOD> Everything clicked
<GOOD> The Pumpkin Hill music is
<GOOD> I can't tell whether I love it or just like it
<GOOD> LEAVE ME ALONE LMAO
<GOOD> But yea I stopped at like, the Tails level after I think
<GOOD> I'm so hyped to play tomorrow but I'm also watching Joker 2
<GOOD> In cinema
<GOOD> I loooove watching flops in cinemas
<GOOD> And then when it arrives late in my local cinema, Transformers One
<GOOD> I thought it did ok
<GOOD> Rip
<GOOD> Also is SA2 genuinely that short
<GOOD> I'm already afraid there won't be more SA2
<GOOD> I need it forever
<GOOD> Not A ranks because I suck but maybe other stuff
<GOOD> Chao Garden idk I didn't even understand it in Adventure 1
<GOOD> I want it in my veins forever
<GOOD> I wanna play Unleashed or smth but can't emulate it unless it's the Wii one
<GOOD> And 06 at least once but
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Maybe I should buy Lost World on Steam
<GOOD> Doesn't it have parkour and Mario Galaxy or smth
<GOOD> And the red guy
<GOOD> But the red guy that's not Eggman
<GOOD> Yeah I know his name I just said red guy because it's funny
<GOOD> Idk the other guys' names tho
<GOOD> As a kid I had a sonic boom 3ds theme
<GOOD> I didn't play Sonic Boom
<GOOD> Or watch the show but I thought his scarf was cool
<GOOD> The green one..
<GOOD> I can't say anything here
<GOOD> I actually kinda fw Zavok's design
<GOOD> Not the others tho
<GOOD> Well does it have parkour??
<GOOD> Didn't think so
<GOOD> No but like
<GOOD> You see the vision right
<GOOD> He looks like a mario and luigi villain
<GOOD> Also I was nostalgia blasted by footage of Ifrit earlier
<GOOD> Probably one of my most played Sonic games as a kid
<GOOD> Is this real
<GOOD> Alongside Colours Wii, Rush Adventure and Sonic Chronicles and Black Knight and Olympics
<GOOD> I forgor what other games
<GOOD> 1 level of Unleashed Wii because I couldn't beat the plane level
<GOOD> I don't know if I can emulate Xbox 360
<GOOD> Or whatever
<GOOD> I should just play Sonic Chronicles instead
<GOOD> Yea but I'd need a whole different console for that
<GOOD> LOOK IT'S BOOM ERA IT COULD HAVE BEEN REAL
<GOOD> You beat him up and his little guy body just falls out
<GOOD> I have one at home but yk, home
<GOOD> Do you have a PS3 emu
<GOOD> I may be using it for MGS4 if my PC can run that
<GOOD> Thanks
<GOOD> Also I double checked and I can play Sonic x Shadow at Recommended levels
<GOOD> So High 60fps
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Didn't that get a remaster
<GOOD> And it was mid
<GOOD> Is the original game mid
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> I wonder if emulating 06 would cause it to take even longer to load
<GOOD> Wait isn't there a patch for the game that makes it better
<GOOD> Project 06 or smth
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I thought it was gonna be like the OG game but fixed
<GOOD> Should I play that instead
<GOOD> Is it even a patch for 06 or is it just a game you download
<GOOD> What if I bought this without owning Colours because I want Sega to think it was a good idea
<GOOD> I might just play that then tbh
<GOOD> Still send the emulator for the others tho
<GOOD> NEED
<GOOD> Is the silver campaign the latest P06 release
<GOOD> Nvm it is for noe
<GOOD> Apparently it won't be fully completed bc burnout but it'll get a final update
<GOOD> Is there a reason you don't own it
<GOOD> Is it like on principle
<GOOD> I respect that
<GOOD> Dies of gameboy platformer
<GOOD> You're so right I should play Sonic Rush
<GOOD> I actually played Sonic Advance like a week ago it was ok
<GOOD> Haven't beaten it yet
<GOOD> I never met Carl
<GOOD> Is it too easy or bullshit
<GOOD> Ok thought so
<GOOD> The aspect ratio doesn't lend itself well to platformers
<GOOD> How much of the screen does he take up
<GOOD> That looks surprisingly good
<GOOD> They got little shines on the orbs and everything
<GOOD> The gameboy rlly was kinda crazy
<GOOD> I'm just jumping around different games tbh
<GOOD> Shadow sounds fun tho
<GOOD> It has Shadow
<GOOD> Sonic Rivals also has Chaotix
<GOOD> But they team Espio up with Silver
<GOOD> They sold Charmy and Vector to buy Silver's bum ass
<GOOD> Idek what Silver's deal is
<GOOD> He's just in a few games I played as a kid
<GOOD> Oh my god do those converging orbs hurt too
<GOOD> This is terrible
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I know nothing of 06 except human lady and Sonic almost died
<GOOD> That's evil
<GOOD> Just tell me I'm not playing base 06 anytime soon
<GOOD> Time Eater????
<GOOD> Also what??? 06 didn't happen??
<GOOD> Oh right it is
<GOOD> Maybe Time Eater threw it up idk
<GOOD> Also wtf was his deal
<GOOD> Also why was Eggman Nega in like every game I played as a kid but nowhere ever again
<GOOD> Who the fuck is Eggman Nega I don't even know his deal
<GOOD> Ohhh he's Trunks but being manipulated
<GOOD> I have to ask again, who is that
<GOOD> Also apparently Blaze is also there
<GOOD> Is she from Silver's timeline also
<GOOD> Stupid name
<GOOD> Eggman Nega that is
<GOOD> Is the original still canon
<GOOD> Sonic Rush right
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> So then if 06 is erased why is Mephiles in Gener-
<GOOD> Also is the canon ending of Shadow game the one where he goes Super and blows up Black Doom
<GOOD> I forget what he does in that timeline to make the admiral dude be nice to him
<GOOD> But he's that annoying kid on the Ark I know that
<GOOD> Wtf was this even meant to be
<GOOD> That is not a fist or a karate chop
<GOOD> It looks like he's about to make s finger gun
<GOOD> Man
<GOOD> Did you know that Silver is Silver because he's Silver
<GOOD> Wait till you hear about Tails
<GOOD> Also what the fuck is Mephiles meant to be
<GOOD> Are those the secret rings
<GOOD> Actually those games aren't canon right
<GOOD> Wait is Unleashed canon why isn't Sonic still a Werehog
<GOOD> Dipper I'm noticing a pattern
<GOOD> Wait has anyone ever made like, one of those ultimate timeline charts
<GOOD> I wanna see the clusterfuck
<GOOD> Like are the comics in any way related to the games, I heard the admiral Shadow dude got an Archie name but apparently they're very often kept incredibly separate
<GOOD> That's badass
<GOOD> Is he always a hedgehog
<GOOD> Or did he steal that look
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> He's the only faker around here..
<GOOD> I love randomly googling shit to see the monstrosity
<GOOD> This reminds me of fnaf
<GOOD> I should read it
<GOOD> /j
<GOOD> Also seeing ignored for legal reasons under Chronicles is so funny
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Also I didn't fully catch it but did Tikal's dad being heartless cause Chaos to freak out
<GOOD> In Adventure 1
<GOOD> Is he called Tail
<GOOD> I just randomly read about Infinite before sleeping
<GOOD> Idk why I literally played Forces, I just wasn't paying enough attention to know what his deal was like at all
<GOOD> I was unironically like waow the portal radio loop is such a jam but it's so short, I should put on a 10 hour loop while studying and I almost fucking forgot the issue with doing that
<GOOD> Because it's awesome
<GOOD> Does this AI ever say anything helpful
<GOOD> YIPPEE YIPPEE YIPPEE
<GOOD> This is who ur insulting when you call me old
<GOOD> You have a few months and then you're ancient
<GOOD> I'm still in Hero story
<GOOD> I'm at Crazy Gadget act 1 rn
<GOOD> The parkour villain rn
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> It's not as good
<GOOD> But still decent
<GOOD> Because you just told me, fox boy WHAT THE FUUUCK
<GOOD> This game is kino
<GOOD> It's so peak
<GOOD> I thought this was Siegmeyer from Dark Souls
<GOOD> Last Adventure was so tilting
<GOOD> I hate these stupid Chaos enemies so much
<GOOD> Vro why does the last boss suck
<GOOD> It was... Ok ig?
<GOOD> I didn't fully understand it tho and kept getting hit by shit I couldn't see or straight up wasn't hit by
<GOOD> I
HATE
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
<GOOD> That reminds me I got recommended Hercule vs SSJ4 Gogeta TAS this morning
<GOOD> In BT3
<GOOD> Also Dipper the game is beaten
<GOOD> Yeah ig
<GOOD> The final boss kinda sucked but it's probably the best I'm getting from Super Sonic
<GOOD> At least Biolizard was good when I didn't get hitbox fucked twice in a row at the start of the fight
<GOOD> Final Hazard was ok but the speed you move and the perspective of the lasers made me super mad
<GOOD> The perspective of the lasers make them feel like luck to dodge
<GOOD> And I kept getting randomly repelled when I hit the weak spot even tho nothing hit me
<GOOD> Oh right that
<GOOD> But yea overall SA2 is a 9/10
<GOOD> The rails and jank kinda fucked w it
<GOOD> I modded it
<GOOD> So the gems all show at once
<GOOD> I modded that too
<GOOD> Although idk how effective it was
<GOOD> The rails were just annoying because of the final Hero level
<GOOD> Sonic when I tilt to the side right next to another viable rail and press the jump button
<GOOD> There was 1 specific rail on the final stage of Hero story where he just wouldn't snap to it and flew off into space
<GOOD> Also I had 1 softlock in Crazy Gadget but other than that it was very good
<GOOD> I can never tell when I'm actually about to hit the rail
<GOOD> Is this about Sonic or Pokmon
<GOOD> Yes I would
<GOOD> Also Brothership is on the streets be careful Dipper
<GOOD> ~~The CIA~~
<GOOD> They're planting Brothership to get people to die from gaming
<GOOD> Gigaleak
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Just that it exists
<GOOD> This is me rn
<GOOD> If u even care
<GOOD> 9 more days till Shadow
<GOOD> Sorry I was busy but I'm not
<GOOD> Also I'm downloading 06
<GOOD> Well P06
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> my wifi is out for a few hours do I play P06 or watch the OVA
<GOOD> Sonic when an old man is about to die in a fiery plane crash
<GOOD> It's a cool ass OVA so far tho
<GOOD> Sonic's voice is a bit weird tho
<GOOD> Also none of this is canon right I assume not
<GOOD> don't do it for Robotnik or daddy, do it for me and you LMAO
<GOOD> Also yippee the funny rotund Eggman
<GOOD> I love his design
<GOOD> Ok this OVA funny asf
<GOOD> I wanna draw Shadow in this OVA style
<GOOD> I don't think it'll get me
<GOOD> Metal Robotnik???
<GOOD> He has demon wings???
<GOOD> Why is every OVA I've ever seen so good looking
<GOOD> KNUCKLES IN A HAT???
<GOOD> He reminds me of something
<GOOD> Why is Knuckles
<GOOD> Like this
<GOOD> Was there not lore about Knuckles being a protector of the emeralds yet
<GOOD> So he's just a cowboy bounty hunter
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Why is there a cat girl
<GOOD> METAL SONIC KILLED HIMSELF???
<GOOD> Nah this is peak but I thought Metal Sonic was a generational hater
<GOOD> How is he in other media
<GOOD> I loved Metal a ton as a kid but that was just design
<GOOD> He was in Generations, Rivals 2 and the old games but yea idk what its deal is
<GOOD> Is that all because he's a robot
<GOOD> So does Sonic.... Thematic parallels.......... /Silly
<GOOD> You may know everything I'm doing but I know everything you're doing, so it doesn't make a difference! Strange, isn't it??
<GOOD> I also have to play CD at some point
<GOOD> Also isn't Heroes the one where they say we're Sonic heroes
<GOOD> I'm sorry but the line is still ass even with that information
<GOOD> I can't imagine any context where that line makes sense
<GOOD> I still don't have internet
<GOOD> May be 06 time
<GOOD> Actually can I start as a certain character or do I have to play as Sonic and let the game decide
<GOOD> I don't like Sonic as much grrr
<GOOD> (jk he's fine)
<GOOD> Oki
<GOOD> Yeah it's sick
<GOOD> I love that sonic style
<GOOD> Isn't there like a Mania cutscene styled that way
<GOOD> I kinda wanna buy and play Mania again idk
<GOOD> I started P06
<GOOD> I understand now
<GOOD> How does one hedgehog feel so slow
<GOOD> Shadow because waow, he's FAST
<GOOD> Canada celebrates Thanksgiving?
<GOOD> The oldest I remember was ben 10 on the DS
<GOOD> Or the Wii
<GOOD> I'm dying I think
<GOOD> I'm on 4 hours of sleep that were plagued with nightmares and I have a 7 hour uni day, then a break for food and a 2 hour Pokmon society meeting
<GOOD> The first 3 hours of which was lab work
<GOOD> Showdown tournament is on the schedule today
<GOOD> I'm not participating
<GOOD> My brain already thought of this unfortunately
<GOOD> Dipper are you okd
<GOOD> Old
<GOOD> 3 block... Vertical?
<GOOD> Lmaoo
<GOOD> Fake parkour
<GOOD> Bet you don't own the parkour couch
<GOOD> You rn
<GOOD> Vs me
<GOOD> Dee Snuts
<GOOD> Me to someone 2 weeks younger than me
<GOOD> My wallet rn is sobbing
<GOOD> I still need to start drawing again when my uni lets off the gas
<GOOD> This schedule is diabolical and worse than it seems
<GOOD> Cuz I didn't get the 12-2 break and it started at 9am
<GOOD> Sprunki
<GOOD> You're getting old Marcel
<GOOD> Get with the times smhsmh
<GOOD> However I will defend Rambley
<GOOD> I actually recognise all of these so I think I'm still current
<GOOD> Naw it was pretty good
<GOOD> Also the smiling critters are just Poppy Playtime
<GOOD> Pibby
<GOOD> It never got picked up for anything because it was a stupid idea
<GOOD> Actually  do you know if the pibby art guy is still going on twitter
<GOOD> Idk who they are
<GOOD> Actually nvm they're still going
<GOOD> 2 days ago
<GOOD> Dipper I bet you cannot scroll through this entire thread
<GOOD> Domain Expansion: Pibby Art Thread
<GOOD> It was an adult swim pitch
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Also the plot leaked a while back and the plot was literally the Pibby glitch is the internet
<GOOD> The pitch bible got released iirc
<GOOD> Woah hey (Dunmeshi reference)
<GOOD> Also I made a new friend today and I drew the yellow rabbit in class and they asked me if it was Springtrap
<GOOD> And I was like yeah but before the springlocks and they said how many kids has he killed by this point and I started analysing my own drawing before I realised it was a joke
<GOOD> I also didn't have to think at all, I already knew it was like 4
<GOOD> 4 actually gave me night terrors as a kid
<GOOD> I was deathly afraid of the dark beforehand and still am but yk
<GOOD> It contributed
<GOOD> These renders fucking reek but less so than the other official ones
<GOOD> Also the 4 is fucked up and it's annoying
<GOOD> And the text is for the brand not the game
<GOOD> It was something like this
<GOOD> Reddit ass pitch
<GOOD> They're hallucinations
<GOOD> Afton gassed his own kids with hallucinogenic gas (current theory)
<GOOD> Afton is a bit strange yes
<GOOD> But Henry made a robot made specifically for killing himself so
<GOOD> They're both a bit fucked up
<GOOD> Charlie's dad if the book canon ties back
<GOOD> His name is Henry Emily
<GOOD> He's also Charlotte's dad in the games
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> And Fredbear's
<GOOD> He was William Afton's business partner
<GOOD> Here they are in an unused Into the Pit image, and I'm TAKING THIS AS A CANON IMAGE BECAUSE IDC
<GOOD> No Afton killed his daughter
<GOOD> Afton also hates his wife
<GOOD> Idk he invented Funtime Foxy
<GOOD> Well he doesn't hate his wige
<GOOD> Wife
<GOOD> He's just negligent
<GOOD> And murders children
<GOOD> And hates his kids
<GOOD> And also barely interacts with his wife to our knowledge
<GOOD> That's just what we can glean from Midnight Motorist tho because we know very little about Afton's wife
<GOOD> Just that Afton presumably got drunk and distant a lot and canonically treated his kids like garbage
<GOOD> He's literally an asshole all the time
<GOOD> He never quits
<GOOD> Also if ITP has canon info it means canon Afton death audio so
<GOOD> We know nothing of Afton as a child because the earliest mentioned era in fnaf's canon is fallfest or this (not confirmed)

<GOOD> Off the top of my head
<GOOD> Childhood game
<GOOD> Same as gens but colours was dusty
<GOOD> First
<GOOD> Not dusty
<GOOD> Very low
<GOOD> I really don't care about it that much
<GOOD> Also most of the incomplete entries are like, a few levels in
<GOOD> Except Sonic Chronicles I got very far in that game iirc
<GOOD> Idk maybe it's just kinda ass
<GOOD> Oh I've also played many of the olympics games
<GOOD> Both winter and regular
<GOOD> Hmmm what else
<GOOD> I'll check if I missed anything
<GOOD> Oh I did 1 episode of Shadow 05 on a laggy emulator
<GOOD> Well 1 level
<GOOD> No I wanna play more
<GOOD> It's literally called Shadow the Hedgehog
<GOOD> And it was released in 2005 when I was born
<GOOD> It was made for me 4 months after I was born
<GOOD> 5
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> It does have Shadow and Omega
<GOOD> This looks like it's about to cut to the characters in the same spots but as McDonald's toys
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> I thought Big wasn't in Shadow 05
<GOOD> Oh wait right you rescue Cream in Shadow the Hedgehog
<GOOD> Dipper it may not be obvious
<GOOD> Who doesn't appear
<GOOD> Ok thought so
<GOOD> He's in Chronicles
<GOOD> I used to use him a lot
<GOOD> Uh
<GOOD> Am I missing something
<GOOD> In Adventure 1 he seemed quite not especially smart
<GOOD> I don't remember how any character does anything in Chronicles because I was a small child and it was one of my first sonics
<GOOD> One of my core memories is the Shadow knight fight in Black Knight tho
<GOOD> I don't remember what knight he is
<GOOD> The sky is blue
<GOOD> Usually
<GOOD> Maybe he's colour blind
<GOOD> Or the sky in chronicles actually green
<GOOD> Or cats can't see blue
<GOOD> Also why did Eggman put Chaos' tail on a frog
<GOOD> I want Perfect Chaos
<GOOD> I've played Forces but ngl despite it being only a few years ago I don't remember a thing
<GOOD> I just remember when double boost happened I was like they're gonna triple boost at some point
<GOOD> Shadow
<GOOD> (I know Chaos isn't evil but still)
<GOOD> Also what is Zavok meant to be
<GOOD> Why is he evil
<GOOD> Also is that meant to be a yeti
<GOOD> Ig
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I think I see an issue with that
<GOOD> HE'S BLACK DOOM'S SON???
<GOOD> Waow
<GOOD> What's the deal with the evil generic robots in Frontiers
<GOOD> Idk those sound like generic names
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Also chat I'm witnessing my first quill discourse in the fandom
<GOOD> I don't wanna trash on it but it sounds so basic
<GOOD> This shit so hard
<GOOD> My mom misgendering and deadnaming a trans person directly to me in the message when she's telling me the person transitioned
<GOOD> Sometimes I forget she's also transphobic
<GOOD> I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to come out
<GOOD> I might genuinely just
<GOOD> This world is so evil
<GOOD> Me getting blood from my fruity ass friend
<GOOD> Jellyfish lecture tomorrow
<GOOD> The sponges and seaweed ones were both very interesting surprisingly
<GOOD> Learning that seaweed was algae was such a strange thing but like, I feel like I should have known that
<GOOD> But ig that's what I'm here for
<GOOD> Wouldn't suprise me there's so much of it
<GOOD> I enjoyed this anime for 1 and a half episodes
<GOOD> Me in like the second half of the second episode roughly when the weird sister loving character gets a spotlight
<GOOD> The phone might kill their balls
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Idk I just have a censor bar down there
<GOOD> I still need to
<GOOD> It's on the list
<GOOD> I'm looking at cool sponges rn
<GOOD> Is that Luffy
<GOOD> Nothing is on the list rn
<GOOD> Except Gurren Lagann I think
<GOOD> Also Dipper what are your thoughts on this
<GOOD> He's turning into Majin Shadow
<GOOD> I know this is non canon and I want it to stay that way but if Black Doom actually did this he's such a fucking hater
<GOOD> It's rlly funny to think he'd be that petty as to orchestrate Shadow's backstory
<GOOD> Why did he steal that ship in the anime thing then
<GOOD> Is it chronologically before this or smth?
<GOOD> Between 05 and 06, no less
<GOOD> The turnaround is crazy
<GOOD> I don't remember but why was Rouge stealing shit
<GOOD> From gun
<GOOD> Ik Omega was kinda just hanging around but Rouge was just being greedy right
<GOOD> Yea I remember that but they weren't on the best terms already so
<GOOD> Wait isn't the story of gens that the Time Eater just rips everything together in white space
<GOOD> Is it meant to imply that Time Eater drags him and the Ark there
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> It merged together
<GOOD> Oops
<GOOD> I thought they were both gun bases I forgot about the Egg beater or whatever the Shadow 05 boss is called
<GOOD> So Shadow went to the ark because... black doom just like, didn't die lmao?
<GOOD> Still can't get over this
<GOOD> (as long lost siblings would)
<GOOD> Also I keep seeing people being mean to Terios and I really like his design :(((
<GOOD> Naming your agency after the thing that killed Maria /j
<GOOD> He's so cool people don't get it :<
<GOOD> Look at his aura
<GOOD> Plus shadow is cool in any form
<GOOD> Like look at this shit aaaaa
<GOOD> I haven't played them
<GOOD> Yippee crustacean lecture
<GOOD> Finished
<GOOD> Finished it in like a day and a half
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> The manga is wayyyy wayyy ahead and still peak so
<GOOD> It's at exactly 170 for 3 more days
<GOOD> Chat I'm having really shitty thoughts what should I play to waste time
<GOOD> Or draw idfk
<GOOD> I'm buying Webfishing I think
<GOOD> And Balatro
<GOOD> Nah I'm good
<GOOD> I prefer mouse for card games
<GOOD> HELP MEEEEE
<GOOD> I still need to finish BRC
<GOOD> Also I managed to peel myself away from Balatro
<GOOD> This game is deeply concerning
<GOOD> I just spent 3 hours on it
<GOOD> Who is Ian Flynn
<GOOD> Might try playing Waku Waku 7 it looks heat
<GOOD> Why don't people like him I don't understand the jokes
<GOOD> Ok I understand what they mean now
<GOOD> Sonic sometimes has like a shitton of callback references
<GOOD> Iirc in Frontiers he says this waterfall reminds me of the waterfall in Mystic Ruins
<GOOD> And it's like yeah man I guess it is a waterfall
<GOOD> They actually do it a few times in Gens iirc
<GOOD> Like mid talk Sonic will be like remember __?
<GOOD> I mean Frontiers
<GOOD> Not gens
<GOOD> Gens is excusable it's an anniversary celebration game it's gonna have nothing but callbacks
<GOOD> Also I wanna replay Black Knight so bad rn
<GOOD> Chat I just won a Sonic all stars racing transformed Wii U tournament
<GOOD> Also we discovered the game is kinda heat
<GOOD> Yeah it has wreck it Ralph
<GOOD> And nobody had levels and we had nobody unlocked
<GOOD> I'm gonna play Shadow the Hedgehog Reloaded
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> It's sitting on the back of the Rhino
<GOOD> Top 10 hottest female Sonic characters... Gone forever..
<GOOD> Rouge is hor
<GOOD> Hot
<GOOD> Just don't be one of those people that takes their shoes off
<GOOD> do these things have a name
<GOOD> Like are they still just Black Doom or is there a name for specifically these
<GOOD> Also is the Shadow Clone thing non canon
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I got intentionally excluded from a thing again dies
<GOOD> I am playing Shadow
<GOOD> I just don't know if the clone thing still happens in the canon story
<GOOD> Like I know HE isn't a clone
<GOOD> I didn't want to play Heroes
<GOOD> I'm losing it
<GOOD> Damn guess I missed it
<GOOD> Oh my god my advanced access isn't workingggg
<GOOD> Ok now it is
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Where btw
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> My cinema does stuff late so I'm just watching it in November lol
<GOOD> And I'm matching w someone
<GOOD> That's a weird ship name
<GOOD> Her name is Buridget?
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> How it feels to say Mayburi instead of Maydget
<GOOD> I know but it's still funny
<GOOD> Coney is getting me into weird baseball things
<GOOD> Also I played the first level of Shadow Gens and now I have to go to lectures rauhhhhh
<GOOD> Ok my GPU pauses the game every once in a while but it's chill we good
<GOOD> Aw yeah this i
<GOOD> Also waaa I need a new GPU
<GOOD> Is this actual switch footage
<GOOD> That's so fucking funny I thought it was a filter
<GOOD> Shadow if he was #retro
<GOOD> Idek if I can stop these pauses on PC lowk
<GOOD> I can't make the graphics any worse the game won't let me
<GOOD> Look at the sun at the very start
<GOOD> I just beat that level
<GOOD> It's peak so far ya
<GOOD> I have it running at 120fps on Low but still stutters because my GPU is being absolutely fried for some reason
<GOOD> Didn't lag during the first boss but lagged during jumping once in white space
<GOOD> Yeah but it doesn't change anything lol
<GOOD> It's the GPU that's the issue
<GOOD> The game runs smooth as hell it just pauses because it can't display it all lmfao
<GOOD> I updated them very recently but I'll try again
<GOOD> I just gotta remember how waa
<GOOD> I truly don't know why it's lagging tho like
<GOOD> I don't wanna open the artbook or OST in case I spoil myself
<GOOD> Ok for some reason my drivers had auto update off
<GOOD> Thanks AMD
<GOOD> I hope this helps my game
<GOOD> I bought muffins yesterday
<GOOD> And I was like yeah I can do this
<GOOD> Triple chocolate
<GOOD> Never
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Never
<GOOD> I have biblical avarice for chocolate
<GOOD> I think I'm almost done with Shadow already
<GOOD> As in like, just the campaign
<GOOD> Imma go back for sooo many extras
<GOOD> Shadow might be my new favourite character ever
<GOOD> I cried at the game
<GOOD> Lectures are giving me so many art ideas for Sploon OCs
<GOOD> This 97 year old selection event still blends children the old fashioned way
<GOOD> Also I've decided my project this semester/year is gonna be the Mantis Shrimp, most likely
<GOOD> Hunting/self defense behaviours and metabolic trades, but I haven't decided on a specific species yet no
<GOOD> I want to know the relative energy expenditure to the shrimp in these kind of exchanges
<GOOD> Like if your punch has the energy to fucking boil water and form flashes of light, it has to be used in a measured fashion surely
<GOOD> My project last year was on Pleurobranchaea Maculata
<GOOD> Mostly on the effectiveness of its TTX in a specific invaded habitat
<GOOD> I was trying to see whether it was a plausible novel weapon in surveyed shores
<GOOD> It came up mostly empty but I opened an avenue to more research into a toxin they possess without absorbing it from algae grazing
<GOOD> Yeah it's lowkey incredibly interesting
<GOOD> Most interestingly it lacks aposematism despite having multiple toxins in it
<GOOD> It's pretty broad lmao
<GOOD> But I wanna do non molluscs this time just to broaden my knowledge while I have the opportunity
<GOOD> And crustaceans are pretty awesome I think
<GOOD> I already went a bit insane studying this slug btw
<GOOD> I think studying a sedentary creature like a sponge would genuinely fucking kill me
<GOOD> It doesn't have to be
<GOOD> Lmaooo
<GOOD> I'm doing that later
<GOOD> After Sonic's thing
<GOOD> Can you tell me if you get any substantial reward for doing them
<GOOD> When you finish
<GOOD> That's funny but also sad
<GOOD> I don't like Orbot and Cubot
<GOOD> Their designs make me uncomfortable
<GOOD> I don't really know why
<GOOD> I did not care for Orbot he insists upon himself
<GOOD> Wow Shadow jumps from a hawk to a rail in this level??
<GOOD> This is kinda crazy
<GOOD> I almost cut myself because I was laughing too hard while shaving my legs for the first time waa
<GOOD> I hate Freddy Fazbear
<GOOD> The scientific paper writers have a sense of humour
<GOOD> Sonic colours ultimate
<GOOD> Real
<GOOD> I googled symptoms and all of the causes are bad
<GOOD> It might be over for me
<GOOD> Writing up my will
<GOOD> Idk maybe, I googled smth and it was like you have kidney disease vro
<GOOD> I looked through a few sites so
<GOOD> True but this one kinda specific so
<GOOD> It told me it was most likely diabetes so lmfaoooo
<GOOD> Although I'm somewhat doubtful of that
<GOOD> Piss foam which just like, doesn't happen normally apparently
<GOOD> And only started today so uh
<GOOD> Scary
<GOOD> I've been drinking water
<GOOD> Not like a huge amount but I'm not dehydrated I don't think
<GOOD> Augh I can't deal w this
<GOOD> I need to sign up to a GP around here first
<GOOD> I might cry I gotta go to the surgery and shit later after my lectures to apply
<GOOD> The surgery for my appointment
<GOOD> I have to like, sign up
<GOOD> Great review for the clinic I'm signing up for
<GOOD> Chat I bought an oversized jumper dress teehee
<GOOD> Waow maybe I'll finally play Xenob-
<GOOD> I was gonna buy fluffy boots actually
<GOOD> And tights
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Idk what those are but I saw some in the same pile as this jumper
<GOOD> They were like ankle height boots and had fluff around the top
<GOOD> I was more excited because I thought a direct was happening
<GOOD> Idk wtf a xeno blade is
<GOOD> I just think of alien from alien
<GOOD> They told me that about Persona
<GOOD> Persona 5 fans
<GOOD> I noticed
<GOOD> This fire emblem shit is heat tho it's like D&D
<GOOD> I mean I didn't expect that I thought the xenoblade was just 1 blade
<GOOD> Bro what is Marcus' fucking problem
<GOOD> Lmaoooo he's so cracked
<GOOD> This mounted cavalry shit gets serious
<GOOD> Average RPG name but it checks out
<GOOD> I'm ngl the latest one being gassed up is called Metaphor Refantazio and I'm almost certain that isn't a word
<GOOD> What happened to Gex
<GOOD> The circus..
<GOOD> Dipper did you like my dress
<GOOD> I still need to watch Transformers One too
<GOOD> I started it but I'm stalling out rn because I'm only on chapter 16 and getting washed
<GOOD> I started 2 days ago
<GOOD> This Pegasus knight sucks
<GOOD> I'm playing 7
<GOOD> Or whatever it's called
<GOOD> Blazing Blade
<GOOD> It has Lyn
<GOOD> The sacred stones one?
<GOOD> I like Roy tho
<GOOD> I keep getting fucked up tho because the targeting AI
<GOOD> When it arrives late in my local cinema
<GOOD> On Halloween I have a slasher double feature to watch
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I have a Pokmon club to go to
<GOOD> We're watching that Mewtwo movie
<GOOD> RE mega sale on Steam what do I grab
<GOOD> the remasters are like 8 each but idk how good they are
<GOOD> Gotta get a few
<GOOD> I may also buy Ghost Trick idk if the remaster is worth
<GOOD> I might just buy 1 remastered and then the 2 and 3 remakes
<GOOD> So 1, 2 and 3
<GOOD> Are the remakes ok replacements for now
<GOOD> Even if they're different
<GOOD> Actually
<GOOD> I may not be able to run it...
<GOOD> Ok nvm ig I can
<GOOD> What about 0
<GOOD> Also is OG3 available
<GOOD> Mmm I might just buy 1 2 and 3 then
<GOOD> Is it like a chronological fit
<GOOD> Actually ykw imma just buy 1 and 2 and browse a few more
<GOOD> Or I could buy deadrising reeheheee
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Is the 4 remake good for future reference
<GOOD> Should I buy OG 4 for 3
<GOOD> Or just wait
<GOOD> Ok imma nab all 4 for like 18 and maybe cop 4R after
<GOOD> 2 and 3 remake are 12
<GOOD> It includes another game but it looks
<GOOD> Bad
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> RE Resistance
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> I could have bought a bundle for 50 but nahhhh
<GOOD> It didn't even have the remakes
<GOOD> My dad denies the vaccine and thinks it caused his chronic foot pain
<GOOD> The pain that has symptoms synonymous with gout while he eats curries or chinese food every night
<GOOD> I think he's scared of mRNA now but can't verify
<GOOD> You'd think he'd believe his kid on a biology degree but nawr
<GOOD> I had a pretty nasty fever when I got my Pfizer jab but like, it's a slight possibility with some vaccines and I slept it off and never got covid soo lmao
<GOOD> Tbf mRNA vaccines shouldn't, in concept, do that
<GOOD> So ngl imma put it down to coincidence
<GOOD> Or just my cells working overtime to make antibodies
<GOOD> Yeah but afaik mRNA only triggers the antibody production and not the full immune response
<GOOD> Which I guess makes sense because a shit fever isn't rlly a covid thing as much as the other symptoms are
<GOOD> Like I had no other symptoms I was just really cold and warm lmao
<GOOD> Eh still safer
<GOOD> I think I got 2 jabs actually
<GOOD> I know how mRNA works
<GOOD> Transcription and translation is GCSE biology
<GOOD> I always just think about it like those old ass finance machines
<GOOD> With the paper rolls that come out the end in the cartoons
<GOOD> I don't even know what they are or why the paper is so long tbh
<GOOD> But yea our body coding shit biologically is awesome
<GOOD> Big fan because god knows I can't code
<GOOD> I was with my Pokmon club and at the end of the session everyone kept saying hawk tuah
<GOOD> Nah because everyone was using it ironically so I was losing it
<GOOD> Not anymore
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> 45:15 isn't a bad WL ratio tbh
<GOOD> I miscalculated and missed Transformers One in cinema
<GOOD> Oops
<GOOD> I was busy this week
<GOOD> I literally spent all of today dissecting a fish
<GOOD> Anyway bye horror double feature
<GOOD> It's Halloween then nightmare on elm street
<GOOD> I've never watched either of these movies so I'm hyped
<GOOD> Halloween was hilarious
<GOOD> Time for nightmare on elm street
<GOOD> Nah Halloween was good
<GOOD> Nightmare on Elm Street was also goof
<GOOD> I've never watched unfortunately
<GOOD> I always use they tbh
<GOOD> Like for basically everyone
<GOOD> Unless they've specifically told me their pronouns
<GOOD> If someone told me to or that that was their pronouns then I would but like, I thought it was all encompassing
<GOOD> I don't fully understand but I don't have to to accept it so
<GOOD> I mean I kind of understand but it's like if someone was insulted by being called a person rather than girl/boy
<GOOD> Wait is that also a thing
<GOOD> Ok nvm that's definitely a thing
<GOOD> I just say they flatly because I can't assert myself for shit
<GOOD> Oh.
<GOOD> I think this is one of those times where I feel like walking into the ocean
<GOOD> Because I've been using they for almost everyone for years
<GOOD> It's like when someone says they wish the ground would swallow them up or whatever
<GOOD> I dissected a fish today
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> I haven't worked anywhere near hard enough for they/them so lmao
<GOOD> It was very fun
<GOOD> I gotta do a stupid scientific drawing tho
<GOOD> However I did get a good few pics to use as reference
<GOOD> Their organs splayed well
<GOOD> It was a mackerel very cool
<GOOD> Lowk it pisses me off BC I'm never gonna have someone default to they for me because blehh
<GOOD> Literally gonna have to correct EVERYONE I meet if I plan on talking to them longer than acquaintance level
<GOOD> Yeah and I'm a boy and I'm a girl don't work as like, a casual way to correct people because I'm non binary is confusing to those who don't know what it means and for someone that does, they know there's a lot of he/him and she/her enbies so it's uninformative
<GOOD> And my pronouns are they/them always feel so
<GOOD> Woke
<GOOD> But like not woke
<GOOD> woke
<GOOD> I don't know how to explain it it just makes me sound awkward
<GOOD> People won't ask that and also it sounds hostile to do smth like that :<
<GOOD> Or at least dismissive ig
<GOOD> Yea it's why I like enby instead of non binary
<GOOD> It feels more casual
<GOOD> Non binary sounds like I'm talking to someone about business expenses
<GOOD> Scott Cawthon
<GOOD> I only began considering I was NB at 16 and all my queer exposure was online and after the age of like 13 so
<GOOD> And my home is shiiiiit
<GOOD> At least as far as that goes
<GOOD> I kinda came to the conclusion before I had a word for it
<GOOD> Like I already knew the exact type of NB I am
<GOOD> I just didn't know there were terms
<GOOD> My cousin is transmasc
<GOOD> ~~Does my aunt showing me Haikyuu count as queer exposure~~
<GOOD> Minor vent and incredibly spiteful of me but someone last week told me they came out to their parents only a few weeks into their transition and I was super happy for them but then I went home and cried
<GOOD> It went well for her I'm happy
<GOOD> But like I went back to my house and sobbed because I was looking at the cardboard box I'm hiding my queer shit in
<GOOD> Or planning to
<GOOD> Like my jumper dress, my lab coat I'm decorating, etc
<GOOD> My bestie is keeping it at her place when I go home between years
<GOOD> Also yoooo samesies I do it sometimes for random shit
<GOOD> The other day I was talking w my bestie and 2 friends and one of them was like we should have a murder drones watch party, the three of us should meet up for that
<GOOD> (referring to the 2 of them and my bestie)
<GOOD> I think I should consider that I'm simply exhausting to be around
<GOOD> But we ball
<GOOD> The 2 ppl are newer friends
<GOOD> I think that they're trying to make it clear they wanna be friends with my friend and not me
<GOOD> But they don't say it so uhhh lol
<GOOD> Being introduced by a friend as another friend's friend kinda does that lol
<GOOD> A lot of them are on either side of the spectrum lmao
<GOOD> Them alt right furries are weird man
<GOOD> Something not right over there
<GOOD> But I won't say more about that
<GOOD> Wooooow
<GOOD> In big 2024?
<GOOD> /j
<GOOD> There are many racist and transphobic furries but they're still a vocal minority
<GOOD> Is the reason because they'd get lumped in with weird furries
<GOOD> Or something else
<GOOD> I got spoiled by Nintendo Music app
<GOOD> Also my favourite lecturer always says fuck and I keep like, getting shaken by it for some reason
<GOOD> I'm so un-used to educators swearing that it's like a flashbang
<GOOD> Oh I'm weird as fuck
<GOOD> I've recently begun to consider that my best friend can see straight through me somehow for this exact reason because like, I barely fucking spoke for weeks/months when we first met
<GOOD> And she still evidently saw something because we're basically partners in crime now
<GOOD> Like I am incredibly dull or standard on the surface
<GOOD> And then the second it's peeled away I'm hyper
<GOOD> And then chill again
<GOOD> I have layers
<GOOD> Or like, phases
<GOOD> It's a fucking BATTLE to be friends w me
<GOOD> I wish I was different but oh well
<GOOD> Like if you don't like any of those moods you'll probably be like they finally revealed their real self and then dip
<GOOD> I apparently come off as somewhat stoic and hard to approach to ppl that don't know me
<GOOD> I'm a hypocrite with this because all my friends are constantly talking about NSFW stuff and it makes me deeply uncomfortable or awkward
<GOOD> But I'll yap about the NSFW I like (blood and stuff)
<GOOD> Not irl gore tho
<GOOD> Or like, talking about injuries
<GOOD> Because my friend does that phantom pain thing if she hears about injuries
<GOOD> Mmm I got a few weird looks for telling my friends I found absolutely every creature so far on our course adorable
<GOOD> This was after the lecture on parasitic marine worms
<GOOD> My hair is pretty and I like animals a lot
<GOOD> And I can't count to 1
<GOOD> Yuh
<GOOD> I felt nice in my jumper dress the other day
<GOOD> Idk how tights work yet but I'm looking
<GOOD> I also need shoes that fit w them
<GOOD> Oooo and maybe a beret or other cute hat
<GOOD> Ok maybe I'm getting carried away I look like a cat lady and I bought the fit from Lidl but who cares
<GOOD> Also these are like, comically oversized
<GOOD> I thought large was like, large for women
<GOOD> But it's large for me
<GOOD> I'm still kinda scared of starting HRT tbh
<GOOD> For various reasons
<GOOD> Real I did it for the first time last week (I gotta do it again this weekend)
<GOOD> But it seems like it's gonna be much easier this time because my leg hairs short asf
<GOOD> I'm still debating HRT
<GOOD> Plus like, obvious issue
<GOOD> If I go home with boobs my dad would probably be incredibly mad /neg
<GOOD> I still think he'd notice
<GOOD> But that is smth to consider
<GOOD> Believe me I wish
<GOOD> Fuck I just want to
<GOOD> Be free
<GOOD> My mom maybe
<GOOD> But literally never in a million years my dad
<GOOD> He got a workplace injury, went through unemployment, his mom died and he fell down the weird Alex Jones pipeline in his mid 40s
<GOOD> He was already kinda bad but now..
<GOOD> (Also must take this time to pay respects to my Nanny Jill because she was the actual best)
<GOOD> He called me a communist unironically because I wouldn't tell him who I voted for
<GOOD> This was like 4 months ago
<GOOD> It's midnight
<GOOD> He's like wayyyy wayyyyy too far gone unfortunately
<GOOD> Ugh I wish
<GOOD> He did that to my mom too
<GOOD> He also spent like 2 months telling me he was going to/voted Reform
<GOOD> My first vote was a few months back
<GOOD> In said situation
<GOOD> My vote got stuck in the little ballot box
<GOOD> And it was rlly awkward because I had to pick up the box and shake it because they asked me to
<GOOD> I hate holding things that aren't mine lowk, I was walking around Lidl the other day and left without buying anything and I had this bread from a different supermarket
<GOOD> And I said to my friend in front of a security guard I hope they don't think I'm stealing this
<GOOD> And held it out in both hands
<GOOD> I think he heard me
<GOOD> I was safe anyway
<GOOD> I'm just really good at looking like I'm doing something wrong
<GOOD> By pure clumsiness
<GOOD> Loudly exclaiming you hope people don't think you're stealing is all the security I need frfr
<GOOD> Also slightly funnier story about my dad he's scared of Freddy Krueger
<GOOD> He refuses to watch Nightmare on Elm Street which I watched for the first time today
<GOOD> I found it funny but good
<GOOD> Slasher movies are usually that way it's awesome
<GOOD> Halloween was even funnier because it's just Michael Myers being kinda weird for over an hour
<GOOD> Every scene I wasn't like is he gonna attack I was just like is he gonna be staring at them while they do this
<GOOD> Also he just walks out of a closet as someone opens it and I find that really funny
<GOOD> Same as when they insult him while he drives past and he stops for a solid 30 seconds in the middle of the road, doesn't reverse and presumably just gets really mad and then drives off
<GOOD> He was doing breathing exercises
<GOOD> I need to watch Scream
<GOOD> It's the special effects I think
<GOOD> Also the fact that I really like Beetlejuice
<GOOD> Freddy Krueger is just Beetlejuice and it's amazing
<GOOD> I agree but the arm thing isn't that uncanny
<GOOD> I like when he turns a guy into a blood geyser tho
<GOOD> Me when I fucking get you
<GOOD> Wait
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> The other guys got off light idk what he did to that guy
<GOOD> Like the others had reasons and in this one he just got blended
<GOOD> I also laughed at Freddy Krueger car at the end
<GOOD> And the effect of the mom getting pulled through the little window
<GOOD> Fortnite hear me out
<GOOD> I have a suggestion
<GOOD> I haven't watched this movie before
<GOOD> It was just something I noticed because it was poorly done
<GOOD> My dad is apparently most scared of Dream Warriors or smth
<GOOD> I've only watched the first one as of rn tho so
<GOOD> But yea I was trying to take the movie seriously and it was good but some of the stuff just made me keep thinking about Beetlejuice
<GOOD> Like when he rips his face off
<GOOD> Or rings her on a dead phone and is like I'm yer boyfriend now
<GOOD> I think Freddy Krueger is problematic.......
<GOOD> We need to talk about Fred Krueger
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Shoot but I might pass out
<GOOD> I won't remember at all if you don't
<GOOD> He did that in this movie
<GOOD> Although the rest is implied afaik
<GOOD> Especially because he's just a creepy weirdo anyway
<GOOD> The Michael Myers situation is CRAZY
<GOOD> Also like the thing that scared me most in Halloween was when they played this incredibly loud sound effect
<GOOD> It wasn't even for anything scary it was for him jumping from the back of a stationary car to the roof of it
<GOOD> I just randomly found this gif
<GOOD> People do this w William Afton and it makes me rlly mad ngl
<GOOD> I don't like when people add it on
<GOOD> With Freddy it was already the case
<GOOD> But William Afton killed kids because he 
A.) enjoyed it
B.) needed remnant
<GOOD> C.) wanted revenge
<GOOD> /out of spite
<GOOD> Dormitabis did it
<GOOD> It's a fangame
<GOOD> Guess why the creator isn't around anymore
<GOOD> Oh I love that edit
<GOOD> Yea literally everything he made Afton he also liked
<GOOD> Very gross and also the game is ass
<GOOD> Everything looks like it has Springtrap's fnaf 3 texture map layered over it
<GOOD> Chat does anyone here remember the Mama Mia
<GOOD> It's a Ryu new tech they tried to call Mama Mia
<GOOD> It was just wakeup DP from ledge
<GOOD> Smash players not beating the fake fighting game allegations
<GOOD> Smash players just really don't know other fighting games tho
<GOOD> Like genuinely
<GOOD> I know I barely do and that's bc I've played em
<GOOD> So is Mario Kart
<GOOD> Nah it's heat
<GOOD> I think I would die young if I tried Tekken
<GOOD> It's not simpler
<GOOD> Oh you can do that in Strive too
<GOOD> See there's this guy called Sol
<GOOD> His name's Sol Badguy
<GOOD> You only need 1 attack dwbi
<GOOD> I won a set against some girl with hundreds of hours in Strive by literally just walking up to her and raw Potbustering her twice btw
<GOOD> I don't play Pot
<GOOD> Is Leffen the dude that's really pissy in basically every game
<GOOD> Did he play HC in Strive
<GOOD> And then DC in a tournament match
<GOOD> Playing HC should have u sentenced to death
<GOOD> I should play DBD
<GOOD> I pinged you to show you this trailer
<GOOD> If it's better than FLAP then imma be pressed
<GOOD> I think FLAP is funny enough to waive the fact it's an incorrect acronym tbhtbh
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> But also we have to consider that FLAP beta was absolutely terrible even if it was a beta
<GOOD> Oh that's AI of my Red Angry Bird
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Imo the very border of mascot horror is Hello Neighbor
<GOOD> Bittergiggle
<GOOD> Oh my god another jester
<GOOD> I'm starting to think I'm cosmically linked to Jesters
<GOOD> Everything has jesters bro and I love them and they must love me
<GOOD> Get into kirby? Jester
Get into parkour civilization? Jester
Banban? Jester
<GOOD> They're following me
<GOOD> My OC literally wears a jester idol outfit
<GOOD> Or something like it
<GOOD> Awful
<GOOD> We wouldn't have fnac 2
<GOOD> Have y'all seen how shit fnac 2 was
<GOOD> I was talking about this earlier today
<GOOD> Thank god for fnac but better for trying
<GOOD> Does the bittergiggle clone voiced by thinknoodles have a name
<GOOD> I'm curious
<GOOD> Five nights at Candy's
<GOOD> I've been trying to find this clip
<GOOD> Monster Rat
<GOOD> Basically a nightmare animatronic
<GOOD> It's one of my favourite fangame designs tbh
<GOOD> Actually original Rat moreso
<GOOD> I really like the rat
<GOOD> More or less but FNAC 2 is terrible
<GOOD> Like, fnac 1 is exploitable but it can at least be fun if you don't break the game
<GOOD> Fnac 2 is just ringing a phone every single night for hours
<GOOD> And occasionally ringing a different phone
<GOOD> Yea but like once you know you can just open and close the doors it's very funny
<GOOD> Fnac 3 is good but its gameplay gets too stale
<GOOD> I think it could benefit from 1 more animatronic
<GOOD> Vinny is cool but he's not cool enough
<GOOD> Also did u guys know fnac 2 can be beaten without switching cameras or flashing the camera flash the entire game
<GOOD> At least afaik
<GOOD> Wait can you stop The Penguin by putting the camera down?
<GOOD> I don't remember
<GOOD> I know you pause it but idk if you can get rid of it that way
<GOOD> Nvm just realised if you never switch cameras or take the camera down you never have to deal with the Penguin
<GOOD> Also one of the few fnaf fangames where the final night is easier than the earlier ones
<GOOD> The Penguin
<GOOD> Fnac 1 and 2
<GOOD> This is also one of the best animatronic designs evee
<GOOD> Fnac has rlly good designs
<GOOD> Dipper you should get into fnaf
<GOOD> And fangames
<GOOD> I started RE1
<GOOD> Because so far I don't like it
<GOOD> It feels awful
<GOOD> I thought they fixed these xibtrols
<GOOD> Controls
<GOOD> Modern
<GOOD> It barely feels designed at all
<GOOD> I literally might restart again
<GOOD> Because it constantly keeps fucking me over
<GOOD> Resource based survival game where you juke zombies but the zombies are off screen for 90% of gameplay
<GOOD> And take cheap shots on you
<GOOD> And the controls suck so juking them feels ass
<GOOD> Used up all my resources anyway I fucking guess
<GOOD> The fixed camera feels awful though
<GOOD> Idk how mgs dis it bettee
<GOOD> Just switched to original
<GOOD> What the fuck do you mean this is the better control scheme
<GOOD> They feel terrible
<GOOD> Also how do I drop things
<GOOD> Ok I fucking guess
<GOOD> Dropping items is literally item management
<GOOD> How does Metal Gear Solid control so much better than this
<GOOD> 4 inventory slots are already filled with shit I don't need
<GOOD> I literally cannot do that if I can't arrange them
<GOOD> Breaking realism by having Chris Redfield be unable to hold more than 6 palm sized objects in a police suit
<GOOD> I mean evidently I'm playing it to get pissed off
<GOOD> The tank controls aren't so bad but that's because I haven't actually tried uh
<GOOD> Anything yet
<GOOD> I wasted a dagger and most of my ammo getting absolutely stomped by zombies and now I'm lost cries
<GOOD> And then I got attacked by dogs
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> No I took damage because I can't dodge them teehee
<GOOD> I can't dodge either of them so
<GOOD> HD
<GOOD> I gotta like, not get lost ngl
<GOOD> Oh I got randomly grabbed around a corner
<GOOD> Ok nawr I'm fucked again
<GOOD> This is going so poorly
<GOOD> I'm basically already dead
<GOOD> K nvm I am dead
<GOOD> Not the time dipper
<GOOD> I respawned and immediately lost my dagger again
<GOOD> If I quit I'm ngl I'm not gonna start it again
<GOOD> I'm trying to give it a chance
<GOOD> Yeah but I know what's gonna happen
<GOOD> If I leave the game with the impression it's really boring and confusing then I won't play it again
<GOOD> That's just kinda how it works
<GOOD> >go to the west side of the terrace
>Shows terrace
>Goes to terrace and uses item
>
<GOOD> My inventory is now full
<GOOD> OH MY GOD I GET THIS IS LIKE A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SURVIVAL PUZZLER BUT DEAR GOD
<GOOD> I think I may just have to quit I'm so stuck
<GOOD> Ok I died again
<GOOD> Fuck this game
<GOOD> Waste of my money man
<GOOD> Resident Evil
<GOOD> Not really
<GOOD> I thought it would be
<GOOD> It just pissed me off the whole 2 hours I was playing it
<GOOD> And that in itself makes me mad because I was excited to play it
<GOOD> And now I can't fucking have fun
<GOOD> Can't until I've played 1
<GOOD> Ok I've been informed Jill is literally better in basically every tangible fashion
<GOOD> That's fun I'm glad the game told me that
<GOOD> Also I still haven't found a single box
<GOOD> Is this what mfs talk about with the games used to be good and never hold ur hand thing
<GOOD> It has a nice vibe I think
<GOOD> But I wasn't scared and couldn't progress lol
<GOOD> Oh I might just play those then
<GOOD> Bro are people really saying this is one of the best games ever made wtf I'm js looking for a guide
<GOOD> Also I just saw something that comfirmed I'm not coming back
<GOOD> Idk someone just explained what a crimson head was
<GOOD> And I just give up
<GOOD> That sounds terrible
<GOOD> It doesn't appeal because the new controls kinda bad ngl
<GOOD> I didn't expect the tank controls to be better
<GOOD> I did, it was more tolerable but no moreso than the original game
<GOOD> Both are bad but one is less bad
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> That was my problem because every hallway has 5 different camera changes
<GOOD> I mean nothing has really hooked me so far
<GOOD> And the dogs just piss me tf off so
<GOOD> Hell, even the zombies do I was trying to juke on the stairs and got acid vomited on for no reason like man
<GOOD> Idk the game just feels incredibly dated
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I've literally not been playing for an hour
<GOOD> I'm just pissed off because it lowk ruined my night
<GOOD> I was literally doing that to enjoy it lol
<GOOD> I was attempting to play a video game to decompress
<GOOD> Because it's meant to be fun
<GOOD> Honestly if I get told a game is one of the best games ever I give it my time
<GOOD> But so far that hasn't panned out so
<GOOD> Mmm I've been told it about 4 or 5 times
<GOOD> Yeah I told you it doesn't pan out
<GOOD> I've also heard about Resident Evil for years as like, some monolithic game
<GOOD> And I play it and it's uh, that
<GOOD> I forgot about FF7 but so far that one's panning out
<GOOD> Although I'm only 12 hours into that
<GOOD> Mario Galaxy is one of those best game ever nominations I enjoyed
<GOOD> But like it's Mario at worst it's like a 6/10
<GOOD> I've mostly heard it has good story and atmosphere tbh
<GOOD> And it certainly has an atmosphere
<GOOD> They're heat
<GOOD> Yeah I've heard both about RE1 so
<GOOD> I think controls are literally the most important thing about a game to be honest
<GOOD> There is basically nothing I value over controls in a game
<GOOD> Even in a game where movement should be secondary (i.e not make you feel good by moving), it shouldn't be cumbersome
<GOOD> Like in Ultrakill or smth I'm like waow movement makes me happy but a game's baseline should be that controls aren't an obstacle
<GOOD> MGS1 was a *bit* hard to move with but 2? Oml
<GOOD> 2 felt good as hell and it's one of my favourite games
<GOOD> I'll drop a game if it wastes my time significantly enough
<GOOD> At least at the start
<GOOD> Like if a game starts tedious I'm out
<GOOD> Even if it gets better later on and it's the best ever etcetc
<GOOD> I think game devs should invent Pizza Tower so movement can feel good
<GOOD> What the fuck is red weed for
<GOOD> Like green weed makes me healthy but does red weed make me do more damage
<GOOD> Will Chris Hansen beat up the zombies with his bare hands if I eat the red weed
<GOOD> Wait his name isn't chris hansen
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I imagined the red weed as like, Doom fist power up where you just rip shit in half
<GOOD> Maybe they'll remake RE1 in the remake engine and I'll be done
<GOOD> For now it's on my I really sound like a contrarian rn game list
<GOOD> I mean yeah
<GOOD> First experience with tank controls after all
<GOOD> I don't think many games use it except like Bubsy 3D
<GOOD> I have been informed that the first 3 Silent Hill games also use these controls
<GOOD> This is upsetting
<GOOD> Actually wtf is Okami
<GOOD> It's one of those games I hear about and have never ever seen gameplay or elaboration on
<GOOD> Like I only know the dog
<GOOD> I only know that thing yes
<GOOD> It could be a puzzle game for all I know
<GOOD> Like Pokmon Picross
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Nvm
<GOOD> Which Zelda
<GOOD> The Quiet Masterpiece of Okami: A Video Retrospective (Part 2)
<GOOD> Holy shit is the Zelda game it's like Phantom Hourglass
<GOOD> My fave is like, Bloodborne or Shovel Knight I think
<GOOD> MGS2 as well that one's heat
<GOOD> 3 is really good but idk if I'd put it above 2
<GOOD> 2 has naked Raiden segment
<GOOD> So it's pretty peak
<GOOD> I just realised why I know Nemesis from RE2(?)
<GOOD> Actually might be 3
<GOOD> I watched a video essay about him
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Like specifically Nemesis not the rest of the game
<GOOD> Is 2 Mr X
<GOOD> I know Nemesis because the dude in the video was pissed about Nemesis in the remake
<GOOD> I don't think I have anything else to get
<GOOD> I don't feel like buying anything else, even Mario and Luigi
<GOOD> If I dislike all these games imma be mad
<GOOD> I do but I'm not in the mood
<GOOD> No I'm just not
<GOOD> Haha
<GOOD> I think I'm not in the mood to buy and play this game rn is like, a moderate response to a question
<GOOD> I wanna try embroidery actually but idk how it works at all
<GOOD> Nah Balatro got me mad tilted I thought that shit was gonna be relaxing
<GOOD> Nopd
<GOOD> Idek what embroidery id
<GOOD> I just know what it looks like
<GOOD> Fish
<GOOD> I'm going to watch seals next week already
<GOOD> It's going to be a long day
<GOOD> There are actually dolphins and whales in that area
<GOOD> Specific species of dolphin
<GOOD> Someone else near me took this but
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Nope but I don't remember their name
<GOOD> One sec
<GOOD> It's called a Risso's Dolphin
<GOOD> Idk much about them to be honest
<GOOD> Presumably
<GOOD> Not much ngl
<GOOD> Like genuinely it's a kinda tough question
<GOOD> Yea but not much else
<GOOD> I draw but only when I feel like it (infrequently)
<GOOD> I read manga and listen to a specific podcast I like
<GOOD> But those aren't rlly hobbies
<GOOD> Very bad idea
<GOOD> At least for me
<GOOD> Awww
<GOOD> I tend to get very very upset when I'm introspective
<GOOD> I'm introspective too much, arguably
<GOOD> Wait I just realised what was missing
<GOOD> Leon Kennedy
<GOOD> EURETHA!!!!
<GOOD> Why did that guy say eureka tho
<GOOD> I mean I haven't heard anyone talk outside of the opening cutscene but also
<GOOD> Leon
<GOOD> I would like RE1 if it was a different game promise
<GOOD> Like if Chris Hansen had large parachute pants with giant pockets
<GOOD> And a backpack
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> Apparently you have a kick button in RE4
<GOOD> That's my goat Leon
<GOOD> I also just like him because there's a gif of Evil Leon being evil
<GOOD> Evil Leon S Kennedy
<GOOD> No that's his evil twin
<GOOD> Because of woke
<GOOD> Doom
<GOOD> Bro this Chris Hansen guy has nothing on Leon wtf
<GOOD> Can't even fight 1 dog
<GOOD> I would fight a dog better than him I fear
<GOOD> But yea I'll try 2 and 3 at uh
<GOOD> Some point
<GOOD> 1 is being sent to the incomplete but not important steam folder abyss
<GOOD> It's getting put next to the shit I got in the 2 Valve collection that wasn't Portal 2
<GOOD> I need to finish Portal 2 actually
<GOOD> I loved 1 a lot but
<GOOD> I didn't finish 2
<GOOD> What reloaded
<GOOD> Sure, I'm sorry that I got mad about Resident Evil
<GOOD> I'm sure Chris Hansen is a lovely man
<GOOD> Yea things that are frustrating frustrate me more than arguably is normal
<GOOD> Not like, anger but frustration
<GOOD> It's 11pm so yea it has a bit
<GOOD> I'm very very tired
<GOOD> I hurt myself earlier because I fell out of a chair since I passed out
<GOOD> Actually I do have 1 question but does RE1 have a guy
<GOOD> RE2 and 3 have guys
<GOOD> Village has a guy but the guy is a girl
<GOOD> Does it have a mascot
<GOOD> Or a slasher or whatever
<GOOD> Yk, a guy
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Also I heard a rumour but did a guy pretending to be Japanese Beethoven actually work on the RE1 soundtrack
<GOOD> I heard it
<GOOD> I wanna play League because it has a little wizard guy
<GOOD> Show me him
<GOOD> I played Smite
<GOOD> So I kinda know a bit
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Bro have you seen the League little wizard guy
<GOOD> This guy stands no chance
<GOOD> This mf looks like the boss baby
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> This how people describe kirby characters
<GOOD> Idk Fecto Forgo was tortured
<GOOD> Haltmann was murdered
<GOOD> Although it presumably was torturous
<GOOD> What I can't hear you
<GOOD> Oh I was thinking like actual torture
<GOOD> Rather than a painful experience
<GOOD> Like Fecto Forgo was locked in a room made to listen on loop to a tannoy for decades
<GOOD> I still need to finish that game
<GOOD> I got past the plant guy
<GOOD> And then went into the lava place
<GOOD> It was fun I just got sidetracked
<GOOD> I saw this thumbnail earlier and laughed
<GOOD> So much dead space
<GOOD> Idk it's pretty cool
<GOOD> No I'm listening to Seep and Destroy / Octopush
<GOOD> Average fnaf fan I think
<GOOD> Oleana is the old smoking lady right
<GOOD> Wait she doesn't smoke
<GOOD> That's a fan thing
<GOOD> That's old
<GOOD> Ughhh I have to shave tomorrow
<GOOD> That's unfortunate
<GOOD> I was gonna do it tonight but I got sidetracked being mad
<GOOD> That Metroid song was quite good btw
<GOOD> Now back to Moyai Splatoon theme
<GOOD> I wish I could just
<GOOD> Do 1 thing
<GOOD> And then keep doing it forever
<GOOD> Better than what's going on rn
<GOOD> I feel so unstable
<GOOD> Doesn't matter if I sleep
<GOOD> I'll be the same person in the morning
<GOOD> Glitch posted this
<GOOD> I'm very happy
<GOOD> Pomni and Cynessa trick or treating
<GOOD> It's human blood
<GOOD> She's wearing human skin
<GOOD> It's congealed
<GOOD> She's a robot it's not her blood
<GOOD> Not if it stained the skin
<GOOD> I love Cynessa
<GOOD> Can I say something
<GOOD> Every time I look at the RE boxart I think of this guy
<GOOD> I haven't watched the movie but it makes me laugh very hard
<GOOD> Why does the skeleton look so forlorn
<GOOD> What is troubling it
<GOOD> I would love that shit
<GOOD> The camera shots in RE1 look cool, it would make a good movie
<GOOD> I wish it was a movie
<GOOD> It would be very cool
<GOOD> I think so
<GOOD> Apparently as a book they did
<GOOD> I haven't heard them in a hot minute
<GOOD> It's almost midnight
<GOOD> Tbh no
<GOOD> I'm laying in bed but I'm too sad to sleep
<GOOD> I keep opening random things about RE and literally all of them are gen wars
<GOOD> About how they love getting fucked over from around a corner by zombies
<GOOD> The thing where you turn a corner and immediately get grabbed by a zombie you can't see
<GOOD> Have y'all seen AI Minecraft yet
<GOOD> dw I'll bring the future to you /s
<GOOD> The game shits itself whenever you aren't looking at a vast landscape because it has 0 perception lmao
<GOOD> Well game is generous
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> People have been unsuccessfully trying to kill themselves in the game
<GOOD> It hasn't worked
<GOOD> Ps5 owners
<GOOD> I came across an NFT bro literally last week
<GOOD> It was in this server lmao
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> They didn't do anything bannable they just liked NFTs a lot
<GOOD> Last I heard of NFTs before that was the art exhibition where they all got skin cancer maybe
<GOOD> Also heavy volume warning but the minecraft thing feels like this
<GOOD> This is a video I found after multiple months of searching only today
<GOOD> I'm very happy
<GOOD> Now let's see Pokmon Unite's card
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Isn't Blissey average
<GOOD> I heard about Glace stupid change
<GOOD> In Unite it's so annoying
<GOOD> At least when I played
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Yippee it only took an hour and a half to do my arms and legs
<GOOD> Lah dee da
<GOOD> Aughh I have assignments
<GOOD> I have a week off but I may as well get started
<GOOD> I should play more FNF
<GOOD> I heart exe slop
<GOOD> Lotus Juice from Persona Trinity Soul???
<GOOD> Woa
<GOOD> (idk who Lotus Juice is)
<GOOD> Why did I draw a character from a game I've never played and I found out existed today
<GOOD> From a video essay
<GOOD> Been thinking about this nightmarish trend all day man
<GOOD> I think I played Dragon Age Origins once
<GOOD> But it had boobs so I had to turn it off if I remember correctly
<GOOD> Because I got scared
<GOOD> I was a kid and got afraid I was gonna get yelled at
<GOOD> Plus I didn't know what was going on
<GOOD> They are scary is true
<GOOD> Also I got sidetracked and didn't play RE2 today, say
<GOOD> Sad
<GOOD> I was relatively productive instead
<GOOD> Playing Pikmin 3 Deluxe
<GOOD> Officially the most expensive singular game I've seen at a CEX
<GOOD> Worth it for peak
<GOOD> They also have Donkey Konga with bongos
<GOOD> Destroys the woke mind virus
<GOOD> Wasn't TCGO already in TCG
<GOOD> Well yea but the cards you collect are still a part of the TCG
<GOOD> It's actually pretty sick so far
<GOOD> I fw the roster heavy
<GOOD> Also 3 million units is aight
<GOOD> Not a console mover but probably made its money back
<GOOD> Hopefully they try again
<GOOD> I actually like the block system here
<GOOD> From what I gather, its comp is pretty poorly balanced
<GOOD> But not in the horrific way more like the weird unpatched Fightcade game way
<GOOD> Some jank, some busted chars
<GOOD> But it's not like obscene
<GOOD> The top ranked player rn is apparently a Max Brass main
<GOOD> Personally I'm playing Springtron rn
<GOOD> Misango was so dogwater to play
<GOOD> I played his arcade and I got fucked up by Twintella
<GOOD> Her ability is busted
<GOOD> She has an aura that slows down all approaching things
<GOOD> I thought I'd like Helix
<GOOD> But it doesn't feel good to control
<GOOD> Og right
<GOOD> Election
<GOOD> I live alone and not in the US
<GOOD> And I use bluesky
<GOOD> This is actually how I knew it was happening today
<GOOD> Because some people are very stupid and think saying you're smart makes it true
<GOOD> I gotta hop on.......
<GOOD> I meant the online thing I keep forgetting NSO has it
<GOOD> We gotta hop on that NES robot fighting game
<GOOD> Twitter artists except the hip and chest sizes are swapped
<GOOD> Also my last character was a larger person, he was a firbolg
<GOOD> Find my pages.
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Goat simulator 3 is the sequel to 1
<GOOD> Oh wait I remember the slendergoat
<GOOD> I don't think it even hurts u so you can drag it through the streets
<GOOD> This is a replica of
<GOOD> It's just a thing they made up I think
<GOOD> Because the house is really weird
<GOOD> This is a replica of Andy's room from toy stiry
<GOOD> I heard
<GOOD> I just beat octo expansion
<GOOD> Might take a break and play banjo before the 100%
<GOOD> I LOVE COELACANTHS
<GOOD> Can't I have a headache bc octo expansion
<GOOD> I love them sm
<GOOD> He didn't come back for 3 :((
<GOOD> Bro wasn't invited
<GOOD> Ebb and Flow is one of my favourite video game songs ever
<GOOD> BUT LIKE AAUAGH HOW WAS THIS SO GOOD
<GOOD> Off the Hook is so fucking good
<GOOD> Frothy Waters is also pretty good
<GOOD> Toxic Anoxic is also heat
<GOOD> No I'm playing banjo
<GOOD> And Kirby
<GOOD> this song is one I've been addicted to BC I'm playing Squeak Squad
<GOOD> I love the Squeaks theme
<GOOD> If only Kirby had a larger stomach
<GOOD> Why were they driving the wrong way in traffic
<GOOD> I meant Tails
<GOOD> Little man gotta slow his ass down
<GOOD> I don't really understand it at all to be honest
<GOOD> I meant the rest of it
<GOOD> Damn no chicken?
<GOOD> They must be parkour pros
<GOOD> Also the mouse noises in the Squeak Squad OST is so funny
<GOOD> And adorable
<GOOD> I wanna keep playing Banjo but my eyes and head hurt
<GOOD> I also may play some starfox games
<GOOD> Because I wanna know what's up and I've only played the first one
<GOOD> I bought NSO expansion pak yesterday so now I wanna play the shit on that
<GOOD> There's a 3DS starfox?
<GOOD> That's cool
<GOOD> They don't have DK64 which sucks because I'm on a big Rare thing rn
<GOOD> I mean I always love Rare games and have played a few before but yea
<GOOD> Mmm kinda is idk
<GOOD> Depends
<GOOD> Yea I don't know if I beat it but I got the idea
<GOOD> I'll probably play it again
<GOOD> Hey I know Krystal
<GOOD> I have also briefly played Starfox 2
<GOOD> I didn't know about Assault or Command
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Where is Wolf from
<GOOD> Also can I just play the ones that they only fly in planes in
<GOOD> Oh great
<GOOD> I just don't wanna play the ones where they aren't flying
<GOOD> And also I can't play Zero because Wii U so
<GOOD> Just a few games ig
<GOOD> Oh that's where the Brawl tank is from
<GOOD> Buying NSO expansion so I can pretend I'm gonna go more than 2 hours into OoT before quitting again
<GOOD> Idk I just can't
<GOOD> It doesn't feel very interesting
<GOOD> Don't be dissing Coelacanths there aren't many left
<GOOD> Last time I played Banjo Kazooie I got to Clanker's Cavern iirc
<GOOD> I'll prob get further this time I enjoy it every time I play it even if briefly
<GOOD> I've already done Clanker's before I just need to do it again
<GOOD> But I'm drawing rn
<GOOD> Oh I haven't watched
<GOOD> I'm just doodling
<GOOD> My favourite OC
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> This game is so heat
<GOOD> I love how the immediate reaction to Brothership getting a 5 from IGN on Twitter was people saying if Bowser came out as non binary it would be a 10
<GOOD> Why is the men symbol shaking
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I aced Grunty's Furnace Fun
<GOOD> It was awesome
<GOOD> I think the game is over now
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> Also I thought I beat the game when I sent that I just beat Grunty
<GOOD> Her final phase was a bitfh
<GOOD> There's like, 4 and a half
<GOOD> After the flying you awaken the Jinjos and then the Jinjonator
<GOOD> The Jinjonator sucks
<GOOD> Bc you have to dodge the 5 fireballs and fire 20 eggs into the statue
<GOOD> And wonder wing tank the magic
<GOOD> At least that's how I just did it
<GOOD> I liked it
<GOOD> Mostly because I really like the Jinjos
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Oh apparently not
<GOOD> Mumbo was just like here's the stuff you need in the next game
<GOOD> I don't know what that means but I heard a bit about the keys or smth
<GOOD> Nvm it's an egg?
<GOOD> Yeah 3 pictures
<GOOD> An egg, a key and another egg
<GOOD> Wasn't this a scrapped gimmick or something
<GOOD> I heard about it briefly
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> But Mumbo wanted me to
<GOOD> He was like you'll find out how in Banjo Tooie
<GOOD> Guess I'm 100% done then
<GOOD> Very, very, VERY good game
<GOOD> 900?
<GOOD> That's what it says on my save
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Well guess I'll play Pokmon puzzle league
<GOOD> (I'm not actually gonna do that)
<GOOD> Idk what to play next actually maybe PM64
<GOOD> I don't wanna burn out
<GOOD> It's really good but I think that's enough for rn
<GOOD> I saw that lmao
<GOOD> I should play the first 20 minutes of OoT again
<GOOD> For like the 7th time
<GOOD> Also I love Banjo and Kazooie
<GOOD> Like the people
<GOOD> Especially Kazooie she's such an asshole
<GOOD> Also imma watch the opening cutscene of Tooie just to get a feel for it
<GOOD> Then stop
<GOOD> Hopefully this fixation doesn't get so bad I play Nuts and Bolts
<GOOD> There's 2 GBA spinoffs I already checked
<GOOD> Still gonna play them I think they're canon or smth
<GOOD> Well maube
<GOOD> Also you can play as Klungo
<GOOD> I do need to finish the second half of that game
<GOOD> Also Squeak Squad
<GOOD> BOTTLES IS DEAD???
<GOOD> LMAOOOOO
<GOOD> Ok this is a heat intro to a new game
<GOOD> Wait hold up this game controls and looks great wtf
<GOOD> Do people generally like Tooiem
<GOOD> I never hear anyone talk about it
<GOOD> Big fan of my moveset staying the same
<GOOD> Ok I need to stop
<GOOD> Otherwise I'll be up all night
<GOOD> Peak game the credits fake out pushed it from a 9 to a 9.5
<GOOD> Wait it sucks so bad they removed this mechanic
<GOOD> Apparently it was bc of Nintendo aaaaa
<GOOD> Apparently Nintendo specifically told them to drop it
<GOOD> Which is like idc if it's a really bad idea because
<GOOD> That's such a fucking cool idea
<GOOD> True however it's still the coolest idea I've seen an N64 game have
<GOOD> Especially because it seems like Tooie would retroactively tell you how to get the items in Kazooie
<GOOD> But now the items are inaccessible without the built in cheat codes and also do nothing
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure the ability to get the items at all would be tied to Tooie but maybe they'd just give you the incredibly long code
<GOOD> No I stopped when I said I would
<GOOD> What the fuck is it
<GOOD> Also I found an N64 cartridge in the first area when I was playing and couldn't get it sadge
<GOOD> Fairly fun but Joker makes me sad
<GOOD> Good to see Pit, Olimar and even Min Min tho
<GOOD> Got into a conversation with 2 random people I don't know while doing a birdwatching experiment and we all somehow knew enough to have a conversation about Arms
<GOOD> True I gotta continue arting
<GOOD> Man I have to be mean to a sea star now for an experiment
<GOOD> I'm afraid of hurting it t
<GOOD> Snake is expected
<GOOD> As is Diddy
<GOOD> Idk you can see it in his kit
<GOOD> Chat I'm home but this starfish was lazy as hell
<GOOD> Took 7 minutes to right itself
<GOOD> Experiment
<GOOD> We were testing the time they took to right themselves
<GOOD> I also had this big starfish
<GOOD> It made me sad because I had to pick them up and drop them posterior side up
<GOOD> Elliot I think
<GOOD> I forgot because I did it in my head at the start of the experiment
<GOOD> Wait the small one didn't have a name
<GOOD> The big one was Elliot
<GOOD> I'm bored
<GOOD> Probably reading or smth
<GOOD> I wanna draw but no energy
<GOOD> It's manga so not rlly intensive
<GOOD> I don't have my Discworld books here rn
<GOOD> I still haven't watched fan letter
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> Ordered smth super cheap off Aliexpress
<GOOD> Let's see if it arrives
<GOOD> Chainsaw Man figures for my friend for Christmas
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> I'm on not very much sleep
<GOOD> I'm actually kinda rusty at MK8
<GOOD> But I can try if I got time
<GOOD> Mm I've been playing Smash recently
<GOOD> MK8 got boring
<GOOD> Was listening to Splatoon music but then this came on and I almost put my fist through my monitor
<GOOD> STAY AWAY FROM HIM
<GOOD> I beat Inner Agent 3
<GOOD> My hands are so cramoed
<GOOD> Cramped
<GOOD> Dipper I can't mario kart
<GOOD> Agent 3 injured my hands
<GOOD> I might continue fire Emblem idk
<GOOD> I was gonna continue FF7 but my modloader won't load the game!!!
<GOOD> So I can't play it
<GOOD> If I did I'd have to restart the game
<GOOD> I just wanna play 7 because it was rlly fun
<GOOD> Or at least experience the story
<GOOD> I have no interest in any final fantasy that isn't 7 tbh
<GOOD> Sephiroth alone sold me on it
<GOOD> Then I got hooked on it being actually good
<GOOD> I don't know what any other final fantasy is about
<GOOD> Probably Materia or something
<GOOD> My head hurts
<GOOD> I've played DQ1
<GOOD> I have to play 2 and 3 at some point eventually
<GOOD> I can't scheme when I'm tired
<GOOD> I think I was about halfway through the game tho
<GOOD> Ughhh I really wanna play FF7 but I don't wanna replay the first 12 hours to get to Del Sol
<GOOD> This is pain
<GOOD> I wanna know what's up on Costa Del Sol exploses
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> THAT SITE IS BACK???
<GOOD> the return of The Strongest
<GOOD> Imma check
<GOOD> Listening to Eleggtroswinh
<GOOD> Maybe I should play ONAF 3
<GOOD> I already know everything about it but still
<GOOD> Oh right I gotta watch Arcane now I've rewatched Dandadan aaaaaa
<GOOD> I can't put it off anymore
<GOOD> Stealth rock in the anime is brutal
<GOOD> 2sentencehorror
<GOOD> Which one's Mayan
<GOOD> It's a very small world but ig it has the stonehenge type structure
<GOOD> Oh it's Tooie
<GOOD> I haven't played that far yet
<GOOD> Finally starting to catch up to the Kirby one trick at my smash locals
<GOOD> Banished to the No games hole
<GOOD> Online PMD game where my teammate walks off and dies on purpose so we all go home
<GOOD> Ough... Help... I'm out of energy and need rescuing... You can wait in real time until you're rescued or pay for apples to keep going
<GOOD> Actually wait I shouldn't be saying this that's just Kirby Clash
<GOOD> Or whatever that game is
<GOOD> Ok wait I could see a shitty mobile spinoff of PMD being made, but honestly the time for it has passed
<GOOD> I think back when they were doing shit like Mario Run yeah
<GOOD> But now it's wayyyy less lucrative to make it
<GOOD> It would be incredibly stripped back if it did release
<GOOD> Unite is on some crazy shit with Mtx
<GOOD> The prices for those ass skins
<GOOD> See now that sounds like nintendo in the 3ds and Wii U era
<GOOD> Honestly Rumble would be a better mobile game thing
<GOOD> I'm surprised they didn't do that
<GOOD> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHAT
<GOOD> Damn they were ahead of me on that one
<GOOD> Tbf they added like, weird proprietary amiibo to the Wii U games
<GOOD> Rumble was always milking that shit
<GOOD> My strongest hyperfixation is fnaf so I don't really have to defend it from selling out (it's kinda impossible)
<GOOD> They got me in the trenches defending Freddy Frostbear
<GOOD> If I were to imagine such a game you'd probably act as like, guild leader so it basically has no PMD gameplay and you'd just play fuckin clash of clans and send your dudes out to do stuff
<GOOD> But that would suck
<GOOD> I may have misjudged PMD fans
<GOOD> As a Pikmin fan I have no integrity if they released Hey Pikmin 2 on the phone I would be copping
<GOOD> I need my content
<GOOD> I played it for 5 minutes I experienced the entire gameplay loop
<GOOD> Dude if they released Arms 2 I would shill so bad
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> My friend about to be so happy
<GOOD> I do that with MHNow sometimes
<GOOD> They could call it like, Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Let's Explore! And it would move mountains
<GOOD> Chatot tutorial guy that really sucks
<GOOD> Did they add mtx to mario run or was it just a one and done payment
<GOOD> Good structure ngl it makes me wanna buy Balatro on my phone
<GOOD> I've actually been not doing that because I'm afraid I'll be less productive doing university work if I have Balatro
<GOOD> Dr Mario World is a gacha game right
<GOOD> Yeah instead of a 2d platformer like god intended
<GOOD> It depends on if you mean a Pokmon Mystery Dungeon game or a Pokmon Mystery Dungeon game
<GOOD> As in, a game that actually retains anything about the original or one that just uses the IP for something entirely different
<GOOD> Although I can't imagine that name carries a huge amount of weight as a mobile game
<GOOD> Honestly I think making Pokmon Resort Manager would be a better use of their time
<GOOD> Or whatever that Netflix series was
<GOOD> That shit was heat
<GOOD> What do you mean Mystery Dungeon but not Pokmon
<GOOD> Is Mystery Dungeon like, an already existing thing?
<GOOD> Like Pokemon Picross?
<GOOD> Wtf
<GOOD> I wanna play DQ2 and 3 soon actually
<GOOD> I played 1 (with a guide) and it was fun
<GOOD> Well fun enough
<GOOD> What the fuck
<GOOD> Is this one of those super profitable and renowned in Japan things
<GOOD> Because I've never heard of this
<GOOD> Ok wait I kinda wanna play Chocobo Mystery Dungeon
<GOOD> I wanna play that one mech series that's apparently big in Japan
<GOOD> And it has that bug with the guy whose theme blasts over everyone else and they made it a mechanic
<GOOD> Waow tinkaton
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> I'm starting a safari hunt in one soon
<GOOD> Well in 4
<GOOD> Whatever shows up tbh
<GOOD> And probably HGSS
<GOOD> I might also just do gen 3 safari idk
<GOOD> More ribbons that way
<GOOD> Watching Gravity Falls
<GOOD> For the first time
<GOOD> I'm also mostly blind except the existence of Bill so I'm very excited
<GOOD> I'm worried for my kidneys rn ngl but I'm trying not to be a hypochondriac
<GOOD> Asking for a urine test when I get around to it
<GOOD> I don't take any
<GOOD> I just sleep off most things
<GOOD> Actually I may not have taken any this entire year
<GOOD> Ouchies
<GOOD> This is scary
<GOOD> The Elise one is funny
<GOOD> Cool bug...
<GOOD> I say it as it looks because of Earthbound
<GOOD> P.S.I
<GOOD> started the IDW comics and now I'm realising I probably should have played Heroes and also every Sonic game I didn't play
<GOOD> I want to
<GOOD> I just got distracted by some other game franchise
<GOOD> Also this comic fucks it has ||Shadow||
<GOOD> Also ||isn't Silver's future like, never ok ||
<GOOD> Only a few chapters
<GOOD> Blaspheming in my Sonic comic
<GOOD> Are you gonna ask me about ||Neo Metal||
<GOOD> He's the latest character except ||Silver and Whisper||
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I've only played Rush Adventure but I get the gist of her thing
<GOOD> I don't expect Silver to stay in his timeline but it's constantly so fucked up
<GOOD> Hmm perhaps Silver should kill Sonic <- hasn't played 06
<GOOD> Please tell me it's a good adaptation it's good so far please tell me he isn't sidelined please
<GOOD> I need more of him
<GOOD> Also when was this teleport first part of his moveset without chaos control
<GOOD> Or is this just chaos control and he learned it without an emerald
<GOOD> I really need to watch smth recapping that game
<GOOD> Doesn't he do this in 05 or is that an 06 cutscene
<GOOD> Ok I was lowkey confused playing Shadow gens because I was like he didn't do that in SA2
<GOOD> Isn't this that whole natural chaos energy thing the hedgehogs have
<GOOD> I think Sonic should say I'm gonna use your move! CHAOOOS SNAPPP
<GOOD> Also I feel so bad for ||Mr Tinker ||
<GOOD> Lies
<GOOD> Also it's been ages since I've played Forces was this his robot in that game
<GOOD> Dude neo metal is so cool
<GOOD> He's spiky
<GOOD> I literally only remember Infinite from Forces tbh
<GOOD> I played it like, very briefly after release and I did beat it but nothing stuck
<GOOD> Ok it looks more familiar like that
<GOOD> I recognise the second thing from both games
<GOOD> The Forces one looks like a Splatoon final boss
<GOOD> Possibly only because it has tentacles
<GOOD> Idk why but the shield made me remember this thing
<GOOD> No unique name you say
<GOOD> I'm jk it's still cool
<GOOD> Was the gens one also a death egg I don't remember
<GOOD> Ik classic sonic fights one but I mean like the one you chase
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Oh I just wanted that thing's name lol
<GOOD> I found it very cool
<GOOD> I played the first level a bunch in wii and somehow couldn't beat the plane level because I sucked as a kid
<GOOD> Yeah ik
<GOOD> I don't have like a PS3 tho
<GOOD> You did, I still forgot to try it
<GOOD> If it works and runs Unleashed then sure
<GOOD> It's really funny that regular Metal Sonic cannot speak
<GOOD> BALATRO UPDATE
<GOOD> I saw
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> I'm glad I didn't stay up for the trailers
<GOOD> I haven't played Okami and the rest seemed just ok
<GOOD> Except Balatro update today yippee
<GOOD> Mmm
<GOOD> I'm just indifferent to most of them
<GOOD> Plus I have to deal with Elden Ring fans for another billion years
<GOOD> That one game where Majima is a pirate seems funny
<GOOD> Who was the DLC
<GOOD> I did not enjoy Elden Ring despite fans
<GOOD> Is Clive Rosfield a Tekken character
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Yeah ik
<GOOD> I'm good
<GOOD> Correction, it was the best announcement
<GOOD> Not the only good one
<GOOD> After all my goat showed up
<GOOD> Wasn't Borderlands 3 like kinda mid and 4 is bringing back Handsome Jack
<GOOD> no, this game isn't mediocre, it just has above average gunplay and a 1/10 story
<GOOD> Oh right the pac man thing lmaooo
<GOOD> I think Balatro should have won
<GOOD> The goat
<GOOD> Shadow and the girlies
<GOOD> Also I understand what you meant by IDW Shadow
<GOOD> And I get itq
<GOOD> Very frustrating
<GOOD> Also I like Omega a lot now
<GOOD> I was gonna say, that's how Vegeta would act not current Shadow
<GOOD> Also they made ||Zavok|| look cool
<GOOD> I like Vector
<GOOD> That doesn't make sense
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Well yes, she is in the top 10 female Sonic characters
<GOOD> Ranked by professionals
<GOOD> still one of my favourite videos
<GOOD> It's so funny
<GOOD> I think Rouge is number 1
<GOOD> This female standing at number 4: Blaze the Cat
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> However it did give me the line the size of an average human mother which is all I'll think of when talking about Vanilla
<GOOD> Do you mean just random girl Sonic characters
<GOOD> Tangle, Whisper, Surge, Amy, Cream, Vanilla, Sage, Rouge, Wave, Tikal
<GOOD> Oh 11
<GOOD> The girl Zeti that I hate
<GOOD> Oh and Maria
<GOOD> She exists
<GOOD> So is Tikal
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> Oh and Shadow
<GOOD> He's one of the girls
<GOOD> I need to finish reading IDW today probably
<GOOD> Oh right this fuckin Pinnochio girl is a girl also
<GOOD> I mean Omega has shot up my rankings
<GOOD> Idk if Metal or Omega is my 2nd favourite Sonic character overall
<GOOD> Sonic is 4
<GOOD> I know I'm just talking about him because he's cool
<GOOD> He's very funny
<GOOD> Also Blaze is cool idk much about her outside of this because I've only played Rush Adventure as a kid but she's cool
<GOOD> I like the Sol Emeralds
<GOOD> He's incredibly funny tho
<GOOD> I don't think that was a quip
<GOOD> It is funny albeit not intentionally on his end
<GOOD> Gemerl or Metal
<GOOD> Ok just checking because Gemerl is a cutie patootie
<GOOD> Neo metal is very cool I wish there was a game with him in it
<GOOD> I would definitely play that game
<GOOD> Is this a comic exclusive form btw
<GOOD> Also I haven't played Heroes does Shadow fumble in this arc by fighting Metal
<GOOD> That seems like the case from what they said
<GOOD> Like it seems like Neo Metal + Sonic and Shadow data = Overlord
<GOOD> Oh and master Emerald
<GOOD> Yeah so he could scan him
<GOOD> Shadow why are you trying to be Vegeta
<GOOD> True if he was Vegeta then he'd just let Metal scan him and become Overlord then completely job to him in a 1v1
<GOOD> He lost in a fucking footrace against Starline it's over
<GOOD> The metal virus arc was peak tho
<GOOD> When I read this page at first I thought Vector just crushed a random lady with a car
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> Silver when the future gets fucked up again
<GOOD> Oh her
<GOOD> Sally Acorn was naked for like most of her screentime I think
<GOOD> Minus a jacket
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> Slightly related but we should also make eggman naked
<GOOD> I'm very confident with his body too
<GOOD> Because WOWIE ZOWIE
<GOOD> Also I'm excited for Surge but why does she look like Manic and Sonia from Underground fused
<GOOD> I haven't read Archie
<GOOD> No one should be subjected to that
<GOOD> Hop off my childhood dipper...
<GOOD> Rough and Tumble WISH they were Sleek and Dingo
<GOOD> We wouldn't have the exploding baby gif tho
<GOOD> I almost got tricked into watching Sonic Boom
<GOOD> Plus Shadow only has like 5 minutes of screentime total
<GOOD> The when you do this it makes me feel this scene made me laugh rlly hard
<GOOD> Also I've started watching Lythero
<GOOD> He's very funny
<GOOD> But it has Shadow
<GOOD> It's not neurotypical to have these thoughts about Shadow swallow up other thoughts and stuff right
<GOOD> Like I can't focus bc I've been thinking about Shadow for weeks
<GOOD> It's relatively annoying
<GOOD> Although I still love my goat
<GOOD> Bald
<GOOD> Actually Dipper how's the uhhh
<GOOD> What cartoon is it, satam?
<GOOD> With scratch and grounder and that one Eggman
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Is Adventures of sonic the hedgehog also the one with brown tails
<GOOD> Where he looks kinda different
<GOOD> Isn't the left one in Underground
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I love Underground
<GOOD> Sonic Golden Freddy fnaf 2 attack
<GOOD> I should totally watch it
<GOOD> The only thing I know of it is the one #retro scene
<GOOD> I'm still thinking about this
<GOOD> I feel sad
<GOOD> Kojima... What is wrong Kojima...
<GOOD> I will give you a hug
<GOOD> It's ok... I haven't played MGS4 but I'm sure it was good ..
<GOOD> Ok that's funny
<GOOD> I wanna watch the muppets now
<GOOD> Or Looney Toons
<GOOD> Oh right  I'm doing the starfox 3D thing
<GOOD> When my 3DS charges
<GOOD> I was gonna do it on Switch online but then I was like wait there's literally a better version
<GOOD> More or less I've played the original
<GOOD> Playing Starfox 64 3DS and the game starts by just saying STARFOX... ON... NINTENDO 3DS in giant cinematic text on your screen
<GOOD> why is this game peak af
<GOOD> Starfox
<GOOD> I like Wolf he's British and evil
<GOOD> MAHJONG BALATRO???
<GOOD> Also dipper does Wolf do anything else
<GOOD> Or does he just show up like hilariously briefly and lose
<GOOD> Also why isn't he british in Smash
<GOOD> Also I like Falco
<GOOD> I did literally just the bottom route this time lol
<GOOD> Like every bottom planet
<GOOD> He's very funny I like the character designs in this game
<GOOD> I also like when they talk and look like muppets
<GOOD> Also the dialogue is very campy and I like that
<GOOD> Is he in SNES Starfox I didn't get very far in
<GOOD> Also I thought this game was like, not 5 minutes long
<GOOD> But it's refreshing to play
<GOOD> I enjoyed it
<GOOD> Also I broke a sequence lol
<GOOD> Slippy was meant to fall out of the sky presumably and instead I just killed the boss and we all went home
<GOOD> Then Slippy was randomly stranded
<GOOD> Oh right that game
<GOOD> Might play the 2 SNES ones
<GOOD> Is Starfox 2 even good ik the background to its release but idk anything about it
<GOOD> Erm grammatically I think you'll find it's a SNES game ?????
<GOOD> (I don't even know if that's true)
<GOOD> Oh also my only complaint with 64 was that the free flying sections felt really wonky
<GOOD> I guess it's dependent on pronunciation, if it's a snezz game or an ess en ee ess game
<GOOD> A hit point
<GOOD> That makes sense
<GOOD> It's easier
<GOOD> Snezz
<GOOD> Super ness?
<GOOD> Well super nezz
<GOOD> You'd be so mad if you heard what I used to call the PSP
<GOOD> Psp
<GOOD> Pss puh
<GOOD> I think I was a bit crazy on that one
<GOOD> But I'm standing on business on snezz
<GOOD> They should have abbreviated it to SF2
<GOOD> SF64
<GOOD> Super Fox 64
<GOOD> Super Fighter 64
<GOOD> Omg
<GOOD> That is bluesky
<GOOD> Maybe I should play Okami
<GOOD> Ooooo you're afraid because it's secretly 6/10 ooooo
<GOOD> Idk I spent 10 hours playing Persona 5 before it became my least favourite game ever
<GOOD> Feeling festive I'm literally wearing a santa hat rn
<GOOD> I'm simply spreading Christmas cheer
<GOOD> Dwbi
<GOOD> I don't see him in my quests list wtf
<GOOD> Yea I randomly checked on desktop and had to update and refresh discord
<GOOD> 1 more fire emblem chapter until I can start the next fire emblem game
<GOOD> Satisfactory
<GOOD> 7 I think
<GOOD> It's my first fire emblem tho
<GOOD> Wasn't this a discourse like a month ago on twitter because someone was called Sadako or smth
<GOOD> How deadly was it on a scale of 1 to 6
<GOOD> More than Persona 5???
<GOOD> Not likely
<GOOD> Idk whether to get my brother an xbox or a vbucks card for Christmas tbh
<GOOD> Ik he'd want that more than an actual thing but I think xbox would be better bc ya
<GOOD> Mmm no good, I have to keep at least some mystique
<GOOD> It's Christmas
<GOOD> That's what I'm thinking
<GOOD> But idk if vbucks are cheaper to buy direct or smth
<GOOD> I'm getting money this year I think
<GOOD> But I love giving and recieving gifts so me and my bestie got gifts for one another
<GOOD> True...
<GOOD> I was tempted to direct gift him Skibidi Toilet
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> He's old enough to understand irony so he says ohio skibidi rizz hawk tuah stuff
<GOOD> I actually explained how a crypto scam works because he asked me about hawk tuah coin
<GOOD> I asked for 1 thing from my mom because I can't share my actual interests
<GOOD> So I asked for a cool bag
<GOOD> I had 1 really good one but it's like, I can't do watercolour or even regular colour without digital art
<GOOD> They thought I was gonna be a good artist but instead I draw stuff of this quality
<GOOD> It always looks worse to the artist than the observer unfortunately
<GOOD> For example, their left hand's thumb is behind the belt thing, but the arm is in front
<GOOD> This is the biggest error in the drawing
<GOOD> It's also my first time drawing feet so they look like that
<GOOD> Their hair is also kinda funky
<GOOD> I'm getting better recently but it's still a long long way to go
<GOOD> At least I drew the rope and the creases well this time
<GOOD> Depends on what counts as art
<GOOD> I've been drawing consistently since I was a kid, but I wasn't learning until a few years ago
<GOOD> And I changed over to digital 2 years ago
<GOOD> I do, it's just an incredibly excruciating and long process
<GOOD> Because every month or so I have a massive meltdown over my art and quit for a week
<GOOD> Although yesterday I was doodling with my bestie on a shared canvas and it was fun
<GOOD> You can tell which doodle is mine lmfao
<GOOD> Dandadan AU where Okarun goes to investigate Freddy Fazbear's pizza instead of a haunted tunnel
<GOOD> Pikmin 3 DX adds the Piklopedia
<GOOD> I was trying to find the altered Pik 2 dialogue list earlier for Switch version and couldn't it sucked
<GOOD> Iirc it changed some dialogue from Louie's grandma that alludes to him being made to eat bugs
<GOOD> But I cannot find compared dialogue on the wiki so
<GOOD> Yeah but 3DX has Deluxe on the title screen
<GOOD> Idk I haven't beaten Pik 3 fully yet
<GOOD> I need to get all the fruit then do the final boss
<GOOD> What else does 3 add I don't remember
<GOOD> (Deluxe)
<GOOD> Also Pikmin 3 for the Wii U is on the Wii U
<GOOD> I like that whistle it makes me feel good at the game
<GOOD> Does Pik 3 DX add some other multiplayer stuff or no
<GOOD> Mogged
<GOOD> Also I will be playing Patapon ASAP
<GOOD> I saw Ratatan and almost threw my phone because I felt my brain being grabbed by sinister hands and being dragged away kicking and screaming
<GOOD> And then I had 5 minutes of reflection saying do you really want to do this to your brain and your focus rn
<GOOD> And then I consumed more Ratatan
<GOOD> Like this shit LOOKS like a cognitohazard made for me
<GOOD> I have never actually done that gamer stuff, I just punch myself when I get super duper tilted but not anywhere as much anymore
<GOOD> Until woke Pikmin 4 canonised Fiddlebert as a replacement
<GOOD> I only played P2 modes that weren't the story so I could get all pink flowers
<GOOD> I did not want to actually try and get good scores it was hell
<GOOD> I got everything
<GOOD> In every Pikmin game I've played except 3
<GOOD> And Hey because I've basically not even started Hey
<GOOD> No but I'm already jealous
<GOOD> My only Pikmin merch is a yellow Pikmin keychain my aunt bought me from Japan
<GOOD> I should have bought this earlier
<GOOD> I only play Balatro on my phone now
<GOOD> Cavendish my beloved
<GOOD> I don't think I've ever considered that this would be an issue
<GOOD> I sent that by accident
<GOOD> But I don't think I've ever considered that being a thing
<GOOD> I just press it when I need to jump
<GOOD> Although the most recent platformer I played was Pizza Tower so
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I never used it consciously
<GOOD> Mostly because there aren't many places you'd need to jump and then immediately jump after landing bc it would kill your momentum
<GOOD> Or if you're already at a mach speed it just makes you harder to control
<GOOD> Why didn't people just know this, are they stupid?
<GOOD> Idk what to draw an OC for rn
<GOOD> Maybe I should just draw weird pair ups again
<GOOD> The last one was fun
<GOOD> I'm very sleepy
<GOOD> I just watched Red One I'm tired
<GOOD> Learning Wobbling rhythm rn in Melee
<GOOD> Yeah?
<GOOD> I don't take naps
<GOOD> Nothing
<GOOD> I'm not good enough yet
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Wario down B
<GOOD> I'm kinda good at wobbling actually....
<GOOD> I found a song to jam to in my head
<GOOD> do I have to watch Knuckles before Sonic 3 without spoiling anything
<GOOD> ~~Should I watch Knuckles anyway~~
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Oh I've seen this guy killing Nazis
<GOOD> I love Christmas
<GOOD> Although my dad called Channel 4 Woke Lefties and went on a 5 minute rant because they're moving the Simpsons from Channel 4 to E4
<GOOD> He isn't even drinking yet
<GOOD> I got 30 in Costa gift cards from like 3 different relatives lmao wtf
<GOOD> This is unusual
<GOOD> I think I just scan these at the shop
<GOOD> I wanna buy a Switch game tbh but idk what to get
<GOOD> Coffee shop
<GOOD> I go there somewhat frequently when I wanna treat myself
<GOOD> Yuh pogger, their coffee is nice
<GOOD> And I sometimes get toast there for like 1 and it's nice asf
<GOOD> I go when I wanna treat myself to breakfast out
<GOOD> And then I got like 4 Lynx boxes {cursedcat}
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> And shampoo
<GOOD> It's the social contract of being a man, you get shitloads of Lynx gift boxes for Christmas/birthdays
<GOOD> At least I got some moisturising cream from it
<GOOD> Obviously it's meant for face shaving but it says it works everywhere
<GOOD> And like, it's mostly the body wash and I don't mind using Lynx body wash, only the deodorant isn't for me
<GOOD> I use roll on because if a scent is too strong it makes me sneezy and kinda sick
<GOOD> I don't think I've ever opened a funko I've owned when I used to like them
<GOOD> They're still boxed
<GOOD> But it's just preference tbhtbh
<GOOD> Very fair
<GOOD> I had like, a mid size funko of the Female Titan
<GOOD> And a few fnaf ones that were the smol size
<GOOD> My parents don't know what I like but that's fine
<GOOD> They give nice gifts anyway
<GOOD> Mine bought me that bag and a floss harp dispenser
<GOOD> And a few other novelty gifts
<GOOD> I heard Antonblast is amazing I js got gifted it
<GOOD> I haven't played it yet tho bc no PC access rn
<GOOD> It's apparently like Crash inspired platforming but 2D (it's also Wario Land inspired so it's similar to Pizza Tower)
<GOOD> Mm fair
<GOOD> Robodunk is a lego robot roguelite basketball game
<GOOD> I'd recommend looking at gameplay
<GOOD> They mostly draw similarities to Crash bc of stuff like crate bouncing
<GOOD> Idk what else is on my wishlist
<GOOD> I heard Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom is a fun collectathon or smth
<GOOD> Psychopomp Gold is meant to be a good psychological horror
<GOOD> Not sure about steam deck stuff tho
<GOOD> I think there's another game where you play as a car and each level has some new control gimmick for the car
<GOOD> But idk what it's called
<GOOD> I think it's What the Car but idk
<GOOD> I still need to buy UFO 50 lmao
<GOOD> But rn imma buy smth for Switch when I decide
<GOOD> Might be TTYD but not sure
<GOOD> Although playing this game again but remastered is incredibly tempting
<GOOD> Mago lor..
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I still need to play Cyberpunk but my PC can't run shit
<GOOD> Wallace and Gromit was fucking amazing as usual
<GOOD> Crom rants
<GOOD> I love cormorants they are my second favourite bird
<GOOD> BOOOOOO
<GOOD> I killed Beldam for this
<GOOD> Stupid asshole
<GOOD> Is this about Starfy because I read that DM
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Boob but replace the letter b with b
<GOOD> I still haven't watched it a first time
<GOOD> It has Shadow
<GOOD> I wanna
<GOOD> So badly
<GOOD> I can't believe I haven't showered since last year
<GOOD> I do need to start on some form of Picross for the train journey back to Wales
<GOOD> Yeah I thought this was like a car bomb situation but no it just did that ig
<GOOD> Does checkpoint have that cheat preinstalled
<GOOD> I don't remember how checkpoint is I barely use it
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I haven't played TP
<GOOD> I do not hate TP
<GOOD> I don't know anything about it
<GOOD> My friend hates Midna tho
<GOOD> I don't really make jokes often ngl
<GOOD> I act like a work acquaintance around like 90% of people
<GOOD> I'm also not like the funny office person I'm Dwight or smth
<GOOD> I've been binging The Office
<GOOD> It's ok
<GOOD> Yes dipper
<GOOD> My humour is very dry tbh
<GOOD> Or is referencing something
<GOOD> Neato
<GOOD> I was laughing my ass off earlier bc I was eating in McDonald's and this was directly outside
<GOOD> He's very detail oriented and weird
<GOOD> There's an ep where he's like everyone cut personal time out of work and the entire B plot is him being incredibly paranoid about doing anything because his more lax friend spends his entire day writing down 1 or 2 second breaks he takes to sneeze and stuff
<GOOD> He also owns a farm
<GOOD> I love regular show
<GOOD> Absurd humour is also good
<GOOD> Which one
<GOOD> I really liked the OG series when I was a kid, like a ton
<GOOD> But I didn't have much of the show on DVD
<GOOD> So I just played the games a shit load
<GOOD> Like the Ben 10 DS game and the Wii games
<GOOD> And the Alien Force Wii game
<GOOD> My ass thought that shit looked realistic as hell for the Wii
<GOOD> It's so vivid in my mind how humongousaur looked
<GOOD> The game looks like this btw
<GOOD> In a cutscene
<GOOD> I think as a kid I was just easy to please
<GOOD> I was literally all about Sonic and Ben 10 and basically nothing else as a kid lol
<GOOD> Absolutely insane how much I loved Ghostfreak, Ripjaw and Upgrade
<GOOD> Because Ben never fucking uses the ones I like
<GOOD> Oh fuck I loved Wildmutt tho
<GOOD> Oh fuck that might be true for me too
<GOOD> My mom is like 41 and I'm almost 20
<GOOD> I probably won't have kids I don't think I could handle it
<GOOD> I'll be here for CC60
<GOOD> I looked at Bonnie and Foxy and was like yeah ok and then the more I looked the worse it got
<GOOD> Also the Chica is eugh even if that's what she looks like
<GOOD> I know right
<GOOD> Oh no
<GOOD> Is every channel except this one closed now
<GOOD> Everybody should play Balatro RIGHT NOW and then the server will be fixed
<GOOD> I fw Splatoon heavy but Balatro is like doing crack
<GOOD> Dipper I'm gonna hack you
<GOOD> You sound like those local business owners that stay open during hurricanes in Florida
<GOOD> Poik can I absorb you for sustenance rn like Perfect Cell
<GOOD> That's yucky tbh I HATE this server
<GOOD> I wish I was a mod again rn purely to see what's gone wrong under the hood
<GOOD> It was yes, I just long pressed on chat and pressed read
<GOOD> the invite link, which we can contact Discord for
<GOOD> List animals until you can't list any more animals
<GOOD> What if they added hawk tuah to secret base
<GOOD> Maybe I should start playing an MMO idk
<GOOD> I don't play mobas
<GOOD> Although I do have MHFZZ on my PC maybe I should just play that MOBA
<GOOD> MMO not MOBA oops
<GOOD> I have no idea tbh it needs to have a good vibe tho
<GOOD> I played a bit of OSRS it was pretty chill
<GOOD> Perhaps but that one costs moneys even if being a Lalafel is fun
<GOOD> Maybe I just don't have the focus for them lmao
<GOOD> I tried it once but only for a few hours I think
<GOOD> Might have just been an impulse lowkey
<GOOD> I have so much of a backlog rn
<GOOD> Sonic has such a huge library and I haven't even finished my Kirby library
<GOOD> You should use it poik
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> Screen setter
<GOOD> It's a sac screener at best if we're honest
<GOOD> Terapagos is my favourite rn anyway
<GOOD> Ogerpon is 3
<GOOD> Rock types suck problem solved
<GOOD> I'm mad as hell bc Shadow still isn't in the UK and I probably won't be able to go anyway :<
<GOOD> Wait there is one near my uni if I go on a day trip
<GOOD> So when he arrives I'm gonna get him and a dress
<GOOD> Or a robe
<GOOD> I wanna learn to sew too, I have this new bag and I have to customise
<GOOD> The DARK Pokmon game gamefreak wants you to forget about
<GOOD> Damn you
<GOOD> Why no embed
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> The closest to proper exercise I've done since Christmas is using a punching machine at an arcade lmao
<GOOD> I just spend time doing cardio and studying
<GOOD> I don't care about gains I care about health
<GOOD> Muscular women are cool
<GOOD> However I also kind of need to continue losing weight because like hell I'm gaining weight until E
<GOOD> In 10 years I'm gonna eat so much
<GOOD> I wish my hair was lonher
<GOOD> Longer
<GOOD> It's below shoulder length but that isn't long enough
<GOOD> Jealous
<GOOD> Where tf that one selfie of me in fem clothing I gotta hair mog /j
<GOOD> Although the big ass jumper dress thing I bought makes me look way chubbier than I am smh
<GOOD> Yeah I'm gonna learn to weaponise it eventually
<GOOD> Also no one told me tights were comfy they're so nice
<GOOD> Like man I gotta start wearing these in winter
<GOOD> ~~I also need fem shoes and fem everything else~~
<GOOD> It's a plushie
<GOOD> I wish it was a bag
<GOOD> I got a new bag for Christmas tho it's awesome t
<GOOD> They were when I tried them
<GOOD> My bestie gave me a cute keychain and I'm gonna learn to sew for patches
<GOOD> Low taper fade meme....
<GOOD> I do want a winrar bag
<GOOD> However I'm sewing patches all over this one
<GOOD> Shadow the hedgehog patch first
<GOOD> Personally I like mid to long hair but my personal type is my gf
<GOOD> I might be ace lowkey I've been thinking about it
<GOOD> ~~Or maybe I'm just around ppl that simp for fictional characters too much~~
<GOOD> I don't get it
<GOOD> I always tell ppl I love Rebecca from Edgerunners as a character and most don't get it and I'm like ???
<GOOD> Yeah smth near that
<GOOD> Under that umbrella
<GOOD> Tien is unironically my favourite DB character
<GOOD> Same with Makima
<GOOD> Like I'm not ATTRACTED to them, I LIKE them
<GOOD> Anyway my bath is ready adios
<GOOD> (I don't like Makima but she's a phenomenal villain)
<GOOD> Ok I'm back yahoo
<GOOD> I need to update my top 50 favourite characters from last time
<GOOD> It's outdated
<GOOD> My last one took forever
<GOOD> Very fun tho
<GOOD> Not a fan of that character tbh
<GOOD> Is this a good punching number I've not tried before
<GOOD> Like I assume it's a 1-1000 scale
<GOOD> My hand was numb after it because I'm rusty
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> I tricked it by decking it
<GOOD> At least I didn't run up like I've seen some ppl do
<GOOD> Also lmao like 4 warning stickers
<GOOD> True...
<GOOD> Hex you should be Tien riding a spinosaurus
<GOOD> Is that background a reference to the FNaF books
<GOOD> (specifically the anthology books)
<GOOD> Oh then allow me
<GOOD> I will field any question that I know
<GOOD> (I know most of it but not everything because nobody knows everything FNaF)
<GOOD> I'm ngl you will gain absolutely no knowledge of the lore from the games except in 4
<GOOD> And maybe 5
<GOOD> Although SL is really fucking confusingly connected to the others anyway
<GOOD> Nvm I like Hexy now
<GOOD> She's kinda cool actually
<GOOD> Now you're Tien on a spinosaurus
<GOOD> Things have changed
<GOOD> Sorry
<GOOD> But yea most FNaF games do not actually tell you the lore which is especially funny recently
<GOOD> Because if you were to just play every FNaF game in order without secrets, the most recent 2 games' lore will mean absolutely nothing
<GOOD> Actually you'd probably think Burntrap is Springtrap
<GOOD> Which is reasonable
<GOOD> Even if it's completely wrong
<GOOD> Because Scott is unreasonable
<GOOD> Same with Glitchtrap
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Springtrap is William Afton
<GOOD> Stuck inside...?
<GOOD> Dude I'm ngl if I played Into the Pit without understanding FNaF lore I'd be mad confused
<GOOD> Like Pittrap/Pitbonnie/Freaktrap/Eleanor or whatever the fuck would make me think that organic animatronics are the norm
<GOOD> They're incredibly fun
<GOOD> I agree except for the arcade games
<GOOD> Incredibly decipherable image
<GOOD> I would also recommend fangames if you like gameplay more than lore
<GOOD> A Bite at Freddy's is phenomenal
<GOOD> Dayshift at Freddy's
<GOOD> Enragement Child
<GOOD> I've religiously followed FNaF almost every day for a decade so I will field any and all questions or advice requests about the series
<GOOD> I haven't yet
<GOOD> Idk about 2 but ik in 1 you can stomp the entire game by collecting an NSFW item weapon
<GOOD> I do not remember how to obtain it
<GOOD> I may, I have a very very long game list rn
<GOOD> Fuuuck I love Pitbonnie
<GOOD> Breathing minigames in games make me super tense
<GOOD> And the pixel animation in this game is phenomenal
<GOOD> The other concept art looks like a GTA loading screen
<GOOD> It's very funny
<GOOD> He looks like Trevor
<GOOD> Into the Pit is lowkey the best official FNaF game
<GOOD> Although there aren't many overtly bad ones
<GOOD> Except Security Breach
<GOOD> I'm glad it was made tho it led to RUIN
<GOOD> Ok Fury's Rage fan
<GOOD> Also FNaF world is awesome it was one of the funniest days in the community when it dropped/was revealed
<GOOD> Cuz we literally thought there were gonna be no more FNaF games
<GOOD> I remember Adventure Endo appearing on Scottgames and everyone lost their minds for better or worse
<GOOD> ~~FNaF 6 fans~~
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> They explain how it works
<GOOD> You shock them when they move
<GOOD> Although you can hedge your bets and try not to for a bit
<GOOD> It's actually very lenient once they're pissed off
<GOOD> Once they get to their last stage they're halfway to killing you
<GOOD> The only super hard salvage is Lefty because his tell is way harder
<GOOD> Baby is kinda hard but not as bad as Lefty
<GOOD> And then the other 2 are easy
<GOOD> Which is the linear order of difficulty
<GOOD> People also employ 3 equally spaced shocks which works usually
<GOOD> Maybe a 4th if you don't mind the salvage hit but 3 is more than enough
<GOOD> Although if you aren't good at FFPS then Hardest Saturday fucking sucks, it may be worth throwing them back into the alley
<GOOD> Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator
<GOOD> Aka FNaF 6
<GOOD> I think that's the 2 things the FNaF games rely on most lol
<GOOD> FFPS night segments suck btw
<GOOD> how could I resist a promise such as this GET OUT
<GOOD> Fangames have innovated on the gameplay quite a lot
<GOOD> At least some of them have
<GOOD> Uhhhhhhh
<GOOD> What mode
<GOOD> It's fun but like lmaooo
<GOOD> There's 50 animatronics total
<GOOD> Hardest vanilla FNaF challenge is to just crank them all up to 20
<GOOD> It's FNaF office gameplay but with like 5 systems
<GOOD> You're in an office and you survive until 6am against whatever animatronics you turned on
<GOOD> Most of the 50 have unique mechanics but some are copy pasted like the ducts
<GOOD> It has a story but it's a secret theory one like most of fnaf
<GOOD> It's William's purgatory after his death in FFPS
<GOOD> That's about it tho, nothing super lore heavy in that game apart from a few droplets
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> It's arguably the most important event in the story because it signifies the end of the first major arc
<GOOD> After that William isn't the villain really and it goes in a different direction
<GOOD> His influence is there forever but he's kinda gone(?)
<GOOD> Idk if you care about spoilers but most of FNaF's narrative is hidden anyway, to get the true ending of FFPS is actually pretty hard
<GOOD> And a lot of the important lore is cryptic or requires playing all the minigames
<GOOD> Security Puppet and Midnight Motorist are probably the most important, Fruity Maze is also important
<GOOD> And then Egg Baby data archive gives supplemental stuff for SL
<GOOD> There's a lot to not understand
<GOOD> If you salvage every animatronic and don't go bankrupt you get the true ending
<GOOD> You play as Adult Michael Afton so it's pretty far into the timeline
<GOOD> It links to FFPS because Molten Freddy is Ennard
<GOOD> It's a mess of parts that's an amalgamation of all the SL animatronics
<GOOD> They scoop Michael and infest his body
<GOOD> And then leave the facility and get vomited out months later into a sewer
<GOOD> William's eldest son
<GOOD> (barely)
<GOOD> Nah he's alive
<GOOD> Actually he dies in the FNaF 6 fire iirc
<GOOD> Because we've not seen him again and he kills himself in the fire
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> But he was alive up until then
<GOOD> He's the security guard in 5 of the first 6 games, AS FAR AS I KNOW
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Marcel... Did u know sprink trap doesn't kill u because he recognise son....
<GOOD> Scary bone chilling FNaF lore theories that will make you piss
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> He goes investigating what his dad was up to which leads to him getting various jobs at Freddy's and getting fired for tampering (and odour which suggests it was after his rotting began)
<GOOD> What is currently theorised is that after William's death, Michael found out what he was up to in Sister Location
<GOOD> Then he gets scooped, becomes a zombie essentially and tracks down the locations
<GOOD> The video game cutscenes from the SL custom night show him to live after Ennard leaves his body
<GOOD> Ayyyy Mikey
<GOOD> Wassup Mike, wassup Michael
<GOOD> Remnant (the stuff keeping the animatronics sentient)
<GOOD> You sound like the entire FNaF community when that concept was introduced
<GOOD> But yea William is alive for more or less the same reason
<GOOD> Remnant is the thing that allows anything in FNaF to be possessed
<GOOD> It's soul fluid
<GOOD> Which purple guy
<GOOD> Michael Afton and William Afton are both Purple Guys
<GOOD> William Afton isn't literally purple, he's just shown as purple in the FNaF 2 game cutscene things
<GOOD> And 3
<GOOD> Michael Afton is literally a Purple Guy
<GOOD> Because his body is rotting
<GOOD> Yea but he's a walking corpse
<GOOD> That's the general idea
<GOOD> if you've never seen these you can skim them
<GOOD> No, if you watch these cutscenes at the end Michael vomits up Ennard and it escapes into the sewers
<GOOD> Then his body is his own again but he's a walking corpse
<GOOD> And then he says I'm coming to find you, father in the final SL custom night cutscene
<GOOD> Ennard is out of him before he goes after William
<GOOD> As far as we know, nothing significant happens while Ennard is inside Michael except they leave Circus Baby's
<GOOD> Once Ennard escapes, Michael Afton gets jobs at FNaF 1, 2 and 3, and then burns down the FNaF 3 location trying to kill William
<GOOD> Then, Ennard infests Molten Freddy and everything comes together in FNaF 6
<GOOD> We don't think so
<GOOD> It wouldn't make sense
<GOOD> Was trying to figure out why they were sentient
<GOOD> Or what the fuck was happening
<GOOD> Because he doesn't understand the possession and shit yet
<GOOD> Which endo
<GOOD> The easter egg?
<GOOD> The easter egg Endo doesn't relate it's just a silly
<GOOD> It has no significant link
<GOOD> But yea Mike doesn't understand how everything is possessed
<GOOD> So once he does and eventually gets back to William, he tries to burn him to death
<GOOD> (which would and did eventually work)
<GOOD> Scraptrap is awful I agree
<GOOD> He survives the FNaF 3 fire and gets lured to the FNaF 6 location
<GOOD> Alongside Scrap Baby, Lefty and Molten Freddy
<GOOD> (Circus Baby leaves the amalgam of Ennard and is back in her own shell by that point)
<GOOD> Henry does that actually
<GOOD> Michael just takes the application to run the place because he knows everyone will be there
<GOOD> And he wants to end it
<GOOD> William Afton's business partner
<GOOD> William killed his daughter, who became the Puppet
<GOOD> Henry also designed most of the iconic animatronics
<GOOD> Michael is still the player
<GOOD> Henry orchestrated everything
<GOOD> Have you ever seen the final scene of the game
<GOOD> The iconic speech
<GOOD> No, their paths just collided because they were both trying to end this whole madness
<GOOD> Henry put out a job application or whatever, and Michael took it because he expected something like this to happen
<GOOD> The person speaking is Henry
<GOOD> He lures Lefty (who contains the Puppet/his daughter), William Afton, Baby (who contains William's daughter) and Molten Freddy to the facility
<GOOD> And then Michael joined to be the entrepreneur to the franchise or whatever, but then decided to stay in the fire even though there was an exit planned for the employee
<GOOD> Because Henry expected it to be some random guy
<GOOD> Introduced in FFPS
<GOOD> He's 5 dollars
<GOOD> This death screen shows the puppet inside Lefty
<GOOD> Lefty is a trapping device for the Puppet
<GOOD> Idk I just like it
<GOOD> Even if it's dumb
<GOOD> Springtrap is very RNG based
<GOOD> FNaF 3 is therefore very difficult to beat consistently
<GOOD> Especially because he can just ignore lures
<GOOD> But yea everyone in the fire in FNaF 6 PROBABLY died
<GOOD> There's no concrete proof except them not being back since
<GOOD> Yea he can do that
<GOOD> Or he can take 1 vent and kill you
<GOOD> (including Springtrap)
<GOOD> We thought he was back in Security Breach and VR but he's not
<GOOD> The tyke and sons fangame is heat tbh
<GOOD> Where you have FNaF night sections but regular day sections
<GOOD> But yea Glitchtrap and Burntrap are not Springtrap
<GOOD> Scraptrap is Springtrap though
<GOOD> Glitchtrap
<GOOD> Burntrap
<GOOD> Which one
<GOOD> The first one is
<GOOD> The second is Security Breach
<GOOD> I'm neurodivergent?
<GOOD> I've never been tested
<GOOD> So idk if I'm ND
<GOOD> Glitchtrap and Burntrap are both The Mimic
<GOOD> The Mimic is the next primary antagonist after William Afton
<GOOD> This is The Mimic
<GOOD> People don't like him but I love him
<GOOD> I mean it's an endoskeleton
<GOOD> It's 7 feet tall and has killed people by turning them into flesh cubes with its bare hands
<GOOD> It crushed someone into a refrigerator until they died
<GOOD> Kinda?
<GOOD> Basically there's a version of Remnant called Agony
<GOOD> Agony is pure malice and hatred, absolutely no reason behind it
<GOOD> Agony doesn't require a soul
<GOOD> Remnant is like Freddy is possessed by a child
<GOOD> The Mimic isn't possessed by anything, the grief of his creator was just so great it took physical form and possessed the Mimic
<GOOD> The Mimic is also running off a program that mimics whatever behaviour it observes
<GOOD> It was originally placid and was a companion to the creator's son
<GOOD> Then the creator's son David was hit by a car and the Mimic kept mimicking David after he died
<GOOD> So the creator Edwin snapped and beat the Mimic over and over again with a metal pipe which is when the Agony infested it
<GOOD> I still can't get over this song it's so fucking bad
<GOOD> MY NAME IS DAVID
<GOOD> Spoon this was made as a joke
<GOOD> It's so ass but we love it
<GOOD> He also made a 20 minute Undertale song
<GOOD> And a Baldi song
<GOOD> My name is Edwin
<GOOD> I made the Mimic
<GOOD> WHERE IS MY BALL??? I'M RUNNING OUT ON THE ROAD
<GOOD> I fw Duck Season
<GOOD> A lot of people don't
<GOOD> People didn't like when FNaF leaned into sci fi adjacent horror which is fair
<GOOD> Agony is also quite dumb because it's basically shadow magic in the books which is hysterical
<GOOD> And William Afton is able to use it like fucking sorcery
<GOOD> (in the books, Afton's soul meshes with some other shit to make something called the Stitchwraith)
<GOOD> And then someone crashes a forklift into him and he drowns in a lake
<GOOD> Well not drowns but disspiates
<GOOD> He's gone
<GOOD> The Stitchwraith can literally assimilate random metal into its body it's crazy
<GOOD> He almost assimilates the forklift into himself then falls into the lake
<GOOD> By this point he's like 15 foot tall it's fucking ridiculous
<GOOD> The wiki describes it as a kaiju which is yk
<GOOD> Afton becomes a mad scientist as the series progresses kinda
<GOOD> He was already making animatronics but in the first few books + Sister Location onwards etc the possession became pseudo-explained and was scientific
<GOOD> Wait Bounty do you know what Tales from the Pizzaplex and Fazbear's Frights are
<GOOD> Won't doxx you but that shit was scary
<GOOD> Yea, but it's also a book series
<GOOD> They're both anthology series
<GOOD> Basically Goosebumps but more grotesque and FNaF themed
<GOOD> That's what the majority of the books are
<GOOD> Other than that there's 3 proper books (Silver Eyes, Twisted Ones, Fourth Closet)
<GOOD> And a few other random ones that aren't stories
<GOOD> But most of the books are goosebumps stories
<GOOD> With some overarching narratives
<GOOD> They're pretty interesting tbh even if weird
<GOOD> FNaF mpreg story was scary
<GOOD> There's one story in the books where a man clicks on an exe on their computer and becomes pregnant, and then has an Alien style death when a tiny Springtrap gets born and tears out of his stomach
<GOOD> Not really, FNaF's demographic has technically never been for kids but I imagine this is like teenage demographic
<GOOD> There's others that are more graphic
<GOOD> Like the breaking wheel
<GOOD> I agree
<GOOD> I don't like most FNaF merch
<GOOD> But yea I like the mimic his story is cool
<GOOD> But also The Mimic is also like 4 other characters with different designs and names
<GOOD> Because lmao
<GOOD> The Mimic is simultaneously The Mimic, Tiger Rock, Burntrap, Glitchtrap and maybe Jackie
<GOOD> He also pretends to be Gregory in Security Breach Ruin
<GOOD> FNaF AR real
<GOOD> Tiger Rock so cool...
<GOOD> Oh also The Storyteller
<GOOD> Spoon do you think I'm neurodivergent
<GOOD> Well yeah but that's not that many
<GOOD> It's the NHS they'd struggle to diagnose me if I came in bleeding
<GOOD> I still don't know how to get a diagnosis
<GOOD> That's a thing to write on ur paper actually, they never actually detail the process
<GOOD> You have to actively go look for mental evaluation
<GOOD> Idk I was never told how
<GOOD> I certainly have a lack of education on this kinda thing
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Do you get assessed for 1 thing
<GOOD> Or like multiple
<GOOD> Eh it's fine I'm sure
<GOOD> I try to avoid self diagnosis but I suspect I have autism
<GOOD> And probably depression
<GOOD> (just a suspect)
<GOOD> That's kinda the big 2 I'd ask about
<GOOD> No Tien on the spinosaurus
<GOOD> Spoon are you a doctor I forgot
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> LiquidSpoon
<GOOD> The former bad mod
<GOOD> Same I also carried
<GOOD> No that's the president of America Hex
<GOOD> Except when Elon Musk keeps being weird about our country
<GOOD> But whatever
<GOOD> I don't like politics so being around my dad is withering me
<GOOD> At least I'm back at uni tomorrow
<GOOD> I got removed for killing someone with my thumb
<GOOD> I called a mod transphobic slurs (me)
<GOOD> Do you say frick
<GOOD> You won't believe who I am
<GOOD> I'm actually DJ
<GOOD> Although I was originally Hexy, I just changed my username
<GOOD> Uhhh jem appele Paris
<GOOD> He's still around consistently
<GOOD> Last I checked at least
<GOOD> Frawy is around less frequently
<GOOD> Greeny I don't know at all
<GOOD> I remember them
<GOOD> I KNOW THAT
<GOOD> I just remember they abruptly left
<GOOD> And never came back afaik
<GOOD> Modded alongside me
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> I should mod again trust
<GOOD> I thought you preferred Reine
<GOOD> Although tbf I didn't recognise you today because you changed name from yesterday
<GOOD> Reine could be a name
<GOOD> Ok Hexy
<GOOD> Chat can someone give me money so I can buy property in Egypt
<GOOD> So what they do is they give you the property
<GOOD> Monolith?
<GOOD> I don't know them
<GOOD> I literally saw monolith like 2 days ago
<GOOD> When everyone got pinged
<GOOD> I hate Tiktok I JUST OPENED IT
<GOOD> I still love Sonic.exe and creepypastas in general
<GOOD> I love them but the bad ones are rlly funny
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Just got pinged on the Insta account I haven't used in years telling me a post about how anti-white racism exists is trending
<GOOD> What the fuck lmao
<GOOD> I hate social media
<GOOD> I could solo everyone
<GOOD> You're not good enough to be my fake
<GOOD> I would fight both of you at once and win
<GOOD> I don't think he even used SSBKX20 in the manga
<GOOD> I don't remember I hate Super Saiyan Blue
<GOOD> It's so ass
<GOOD> Orange Piccolo is epic
<GOOD> But we can all have a difference of opinion
<GOOD> I like Janemba
<GOOD> Like holy shit
<GOOD> Ppl aren't ready for this but most DB arcs work better as films
<GOOD> At least Super would imo
<GOOD> Super fans watching Daima
<GOOD> I'm not a fan of the Daima one
<GOOD> Even if Daima has been cool so far
<GOOD> Do you mind if I say what it is
<GOOD> Because Super Saiyan 3 Vegeta being retroactively made a thing is dumb imo
<GOOD> Especially with that design
<GOOD> True...
<GOOD> I like fat Janemba too
<GOOD> The yellow form
<GOOD> I like ignoring powerscaling but some of the stuff is so silly
<GOOD> Like in the latest arc of Super they were throwing small buildings to try and hurt Goku
<GOOD> Like ??
<GOOD> I think we're a bit past that mate
<GOOD> GT is awesome tho
<GOOD> DB is cool actually
<GOOD> ~~Read Kagurabachi~~
<GOOD> And watch Dunmeshi
<GOOD> And maybe Dandadan because they're all peak
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> It doesn't go down in quality
<GOOD> He's so cool
<GOOD> I forget Silver exists for some reason
<GOOD> I used to love him as a kid
<GOOD> I still love him but not as much as the others rn
<GOOD> Maybe that's why
<GOOD> Might be because he's only prominently featured in 06
<GOOD> I only watched 1 Death Battle ep and it was good
<GOOD> Deez Bnuts Zlmao
<GOOD> Gottem
<GOOD> I love buff men and women artstyle
<GOOD> Kefla
<GOOD> They are NOT as cool as Sonic
<GOOD> Cute tho
<GOOD> I'm cooler, I'm Shadow
<GOOD> Who the fuck is this
<GOOD> This is meant to be FNaF merch
<GOOD> It's frostbite BB apparently but he doesn't even have his sign
<GOOD> Shit don't even look like the same character
<GOOD> Just read about new Facebook ToS gonna die
<GOOD> Anyway I totally should have copped this
<GOOD> I'm her
<GOOD> Well guess who feels fem today
<GOOD> I wanted to buy Kuromi and Shadow merch today so badly
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> That Shadow was 35
<GOOD> Why did I think this was a fnaf book
<GOOD> I swear that shit said Elizabeth Afton
<GOOD> Just watched the most confusing video of this year so far
<GOOD> More confusing than the property in Egypt vids
<GOOD> My mom bought me this roll on lavender thing
<GOOD> Apparently I'm meant to roll it on my wrists and then I fall asleep
<GOOD> No clue if it works but I'm gonna try it
<GOOD> I use watermelon roll on
<GOOD> I don't smell like anything naturally
<GOOD> Unethical product consumption, think of the babies that were ground into powder
<GOOD> How evil
<GOOD> Gen Z is trying to cancel Hexy???
<GOOD> Cancer
<GOOD> Like asbestos
<GOOD> Did you know talcum powder is made out of asbestos
<GOOD> This is true
<GOOD> Matey bubble bath>>>
<GOOD> Omg I can finally use my steam library now I'm back at uni
<GOOD> Antonblast time
<GOOD> And Sonic Lost World
<GOOD> In preparation for Sonic Movie 4, I guess I'll be meeting the Deadly Six.... Like if you get the reference..m
<GOOD> Nah lowkey I feel different anxiety about exams niw
<GOOD> Instead of actually feeling it my brain is just like expected emotion: anxiety and I just don't feel it lmfao
<GOOD> I don't *not* feel it but I also don't feel it
<GOOD> It's weird
<GOOD> I'm kinda doing well rn in Uni
<GOOD> I'm getting like 70-80% on exams
<GOOD> On average
<GOOD> I had like B,C,B in A level
<GOOD> Or was it BCC idk
<GOOD> Either way I was doing ass bc I didn't like the A levels except Biology which was mad hard
<GOOD> Now in uni I'm loving it
<GOOD> Bc fish are epic
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> You can say fuck
<GOOD> Also kill
<GOOD> Not if I saw you first choom
<GOOD> 2 beige foods I threw in the air fryer in 2 plastic bowls, we back on uni meals /hj
<GOOD> I don't rlly eat ramen
<GOOD> Ask to go to Wetherspoons instead and order a million pints
<GOOD> I don't drink lol
<GOOD> Last time I went to a pizza place I ate croutons from the salad bar
<GOOD> No joke
<GOOD> Kinda yummy tho
<GOOD> Eh it was years ago
<GOOD> I'm not a cheese fan
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Yeah but I don't like half the ingredients of pizza lmfao so no point
<GOOD> That dessert looks awesome
<GOOD> Banned from the biggest Kagurabachi server bc the mod is power tripping and now I can't talk about Kagurabachi anymore :((
<GOOD> I'm so upset
<GOOD> They mod 300+ servers and subreddits
<GOOD> I asked them about it and they immediately banned me
<GOOD> 2k members
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is niche rn
<GOOD> It has no anime
<GOOD> Not very active
<GOOD> I'm learning to sew
<GOOD> I'm learning so I can sew patches onto my bag
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> How it feels to pay your rent for the rest of the academic year
<GOOD> 1 instalment in advance no less because I'm being frugal
<GOOD> I love OC lore
<GOOD> They detail the dosage on the pack usually
<GOOD> It's usually like, you're allowed 1 or 2 every 6 hours or smth but read every single time to be safe
<GOOD> I don't take them in most cases because I'm kinda nervous about getting a resistance and then they won't work anymore if I actually need them
<GOOD> However I think that's an unfounded fear
<GOOD> I'm buying it immediately
<GOOD> I'm a big fan of Jet the Hawk too
<GOOD> Why he's also from Riders
<GOOD> He's a member of the Babylon Rogues!!
<GOOD> Also yea I've been saving for Miku
<GOOD> I paid off my rent for this year today so I'm celebrating with Miku skin
<GOOD> And maybe Dragon Quest 11
<GOOD> I just ate an apple
<GOOD> I hate bananas
<GOOD> Pikmin is fucking awesome
<GOOD> Pikmin 2 is awesome
<GOOD> All 4 of them are awesome actually
<GOOD> I love when the purple pikmin does the sumo stomp
<GOOD> He's so wiggly in 2 I love him
<GOOD> The doomsday apparatus kinda sucks tho
<GOOD> Is that the american dennis the menace on the package
<GOOD> I hate that fucker
<GOOD> Dennis the menace sucks
<GOOD> I mean I guess rocks are a spiritual successor in the sense they break everything
<GOOD> Why did they call him that when he's a nice person
<GOOD> It's so stupid
<GOOD> Like why would you make a character that has the same fucking name as a different Dennis the Menace, but he's not a menace
<GOOD> I know and it's stupid
<GOOD> UK Dennis gets his dog to maul people and shit like lmao
<GOOD> Mogged by a real menace
<GOOD> He's called Dennis the Menace I'd expect that to be honest
<GOOD> If you have beef with 1 specific child that's lowkey pathetic
<GOOD> Unless it's UK Dennis the Menace because everyone hates him
<GOOD> Like what an asshole
<GOOD> I would be mad at this child if I had a table
<GOOD> And he sawed it in half
<GOOD> Idk I think ripping a book isn't comparable to setting your house on fire on purpose
<GOOD> Same as smashing windows with bricks like
<GOOD> Idk he seems way more malicious
<GOOD> And this one's dog would probably eat the other guy's dog so idk
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> I'm a Dennis expert
<GOOD> I liked Minnie the Minx more tbh
<GOOD> Black
<GOOD> It's very much black
<GOOD> Idk he's just a lot more malevolent than the stupid American toddler
<GOOD> No he had stuff before this too
<GOOD> He's just always been awful
<GOOD> He's malevolent
<GOOD> You wouldn't get it
<GOOD> Your Dennis is a random 3 year old for some reason
<GOOD> He's not that menacing
<GOOD> I wanna dye mine that colour too but same for me
<GOOD> I'm blonde rn
<GOOD> Yeah I like my hair rn
<GOOD> It's one of my only good features
<GOOD> Dan Hentschel
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> I was too late
<GOOD> He's a visionary
<GOOD> one of his more avante garde pieces
<GOOD> When I'm bored I just go on Dan's account and scroll
<GOOD> I'm personally a fan of when Dan Hentschel is The Chuckler
<GOOD> Ikr
<GOOD> I'm not weak tbh
<GOOD> I might sleep tbh
<GOOD> Not sure tho
<GOOD> They're such goobers
<GOOD> Yahoo
<GOOD> Miku Fortnite
<GOOD> I got 60 tiers in 1 day
<GOOD> if you wanted a new-ish interpretation of FNaF lore in a cinematic fashion
<GOOD> It's pretty concise imo, if not a little clean cut
<GOOD> But that's for the sake of the story being told
<GOOD> It does conflict with what I told you somewhat (FNaF 1 and 2 night guards aren't all Michael, he only appears during Night 6)
<GOOD> It also changes the chronological order so 1 and 2 happen before Sister Location
<GOOD> I should make my own FNaF timeline
<GOOD> It's literally so easy up until like, 1980
<GOOD> *1983
<GOOD> Which Bonnie song are you referring to
<GOOD> I watched the timeline vid and I disagreed waaaa
<GOOD> It implied William had full autonomy over Shadow Freddy
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I thought you meant an actual song
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Shadow Freddy actually exists to some provable degree unlike Phantom Freddy
<GOOD> Also I'm no longer a believer in MikeFrightguard
<GOOD> Although I'll have to think about it
<GOOD> Shadow Freddy is also made of Agony, and is possibly Eleanor
<GOOD> Shadow Freddy is also implied to be servile to William in some fashion
<GOOD> Or at least aiding him
<GOOD> It has more than 5
<GOOD> Although I guess like 5 of them have the flashbang jumpscares
<GOOD> There is no phantom bonnie
<GOOD> There is Puppet and Mangle
<GOOD> Appears in one of the useless cams in a hallway and once you pull cams down it makes a horrific noise and blocks your screen for ages
<GOOD> Like 12 seconds
<GOOD> And causes an audio error iirc
<GOOD> Me drawing perspective
<GOOD> But yea there's Chica, Freddy, Puppet, Mangle, Foxy and BB
<GOOD> Although as far as we know the phantoms are not real
<GOOD> They are genuinely hallucinations
<GOOD> Because the others are far more infrequent to get jumpscared by
<GOOD> Foxy fucking sucks because you can barely avoid him
<GOOD> Mangle and Puppet are pretty rare, Chica is kinda common but not rlly
<GOOD> Chica requires you to look at a specific camera tho like Puppet
<GOOD> They aren't rlly random
<GOOD> And imo the issue with FNaF 3 is the randomness of Springtrap
<GOOD> All of them are avoidable
<GOOD> Iirc seeing them on a cam isn't the be all and end all, you can just stop looking and it's fine
<GOOD> Foxy is a bitch because if you don't react in the office he locks you into the jumpscare
<GOOD> Phantom Freddy is pretty oppressive and iirc one of the worst for top level FNaF 3 (like, omce you understand the mechanics)
<GOOD> Because he creates fake ambience that makes Aggressive Nightmare suck ass
<GOOD> Yippee finally
<GOOD> Most recent strat requires dividing cams into bubbles where you basically reduce the map into like 3 specific cams you use
<GOOD> You don't look at cams until you hear Springtrap getting closer and then you pray he listens to you
<GOOD> this guy is very fun and informative
<GOOD> The montage is the payoff to the explanation
<GOOD> His toy bonnie deployed shit is my favourite montage of his
<GOOD> Cheeky is an odd word to use
<GOOD> Also he's a challenge YouTuber so including the challenge in the video is kind of what is needed
<GOOD> Wouldn't he just include the entire run if that was the case
<GOOD> Or not speed it up
<GOOD> He splices gameplay inbetween explanation all the time
<GOOD> I mean it's a very real sense of frustration
<GOOD> Shit like RnCAC is gonna be stressful
<GOOD> And shit like his FNaFlocke Foxy death
<GOOD> I would be mad as hell if I died to awful luck + a human timer error
<GOOD> anyway 5 GAMES NEXT
<GOOD> Fine, *I would get mad at games if they were hindering my content
<GOOD> Anyway I'm lowk pissed off that I believed ToysDCI for this long
<GOOD> Bc it makes no fucking sense
<GOOD> I just kinda brushed over it because I hate the toys and they don't rlly come up much
<GOOD> Every FNaF theory has a shortened name
<GOOD> ToysDCI is the theory that the Toy animatronics are possessed by the victims of the Dead Children Incident
<GOOD> Which is not the same as the MCI (Missing Children Incident)
<GOOD> The incident that happens between nights 4 and 5 in FNaF 2
<GOOD> That causes the closure of FNaF 2's location
<GOOD> *5 and 6
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> However it's uncertain who they are possessed by, and some people still think that they are not possessed
<GOOD> Afton used the Springbonnie suit to kill 5 more children
<GOOD> The theory that makes the most sense is that the MCI kids' souls are partially bound to the Toys because the OG animatronics were used for parts in the Toys
<GOOD> That's why they're Withered
<GOOD> Phone Guy has never been anyone important to our knowledge
<GOOD> We used to think he was but that's no longer the case
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> The phone thing was so funny
<GOOD> I still subscribe to the idea it was a crank for the springlock suit
<GOOD> But that's just my oldhead FNaF brain talking
<GOOD> Although tbf that sprite appears during Save Them so it would make sense for William to have a crank
<GOOD> Yeah lol Fazbear employees don't care about the kids
<GOOD> They care about publicity
<GOOD> The Bite literally happens the day after this phone call
<GOOD> (although not to a kid imo)
<GOOD> I've switched up on the FNaF timeline I talked to you about btw Bounty
<GOOD> I haven't synthesised my own yet but the one I told you was the most concise one because Matpat
<GOOD> Even if it was wrong
<GOOD> Jeremy Fitzgerald being the Bite victim makes the most sense to me
<GOOD> Wrong bite
<GOOD> That's the Bite of 83
<GOOD> I'm talking about the actual Bite of 87
<GOOD> We only had like 3 characters at that point
<GOOD> We just thought it was Phone Guy because it couldn't be anyone else
<GOOD> At this point we had 3 characters with names and 2 without
<GOOD> So we just figured the 2 without were the same
<GOOD> We also figured everyone was everyone else
<GOOD> Ppl though Mike was Purple Guy pretty often
<GOOD> Or Vincent or whatever you wanted to call him back then because William Afton wasn't his name until Sister Location
<GOOD> Tbf Phone Guy doesn't not understand, he just obfuscates a ton of information
<GOOD> He knew kids were murdered because William didn't hide them in the DCI
<GOOD> I mean he'd know it was murder
<GOOD> Their bodies are strewn across the floor of the building
<GOOD> That's why in FNaF 2 the place closes down immediately after someone used one of the suits.. a yellow one
<GOOD> I mean it's true
<GOOD> I mean he didn't think anything
<GOOD> I think he just said someone used the suits and also they aren't acting right
<GOOD> He couldn't possibly know the real reason
<GOOD> The Toys are berserk because the Withereds withessed Afton kill another 5 children and they're still not able to differentiate between adults and William Afton specifically very well
<GOOD> I don't know what he thinks tbh
<GOOD> It's just exposition at the end of the day
<GOOD> Phone guy is very obviously not purple guy but we were tugging at straws
<GOOD> We needed and still need everything to be interconnected
<GOOD> We see Afton in the FNaF 4 between night scenes and when he's in shadow, he's purple
<GOOD> Although now purple is just a distinguishing colour for him (and Michael but it was never used that way for him)
<GOOD> ((Except that one time Afton was yellow for literally no fucking reason))
<GOOD> Scott when I get my hands on you we literally only proved definitively that Midnight Motorist was Afton like a few months ago
<GOOD> You could have solved this by just making him fucking purple
<GOOD> they made Scott pixel art real
<GOOD> I love how ass Scott's pixel art is
<GOOD> But noooo you had to make him look like this
<GOOD> So retro
<GOOD> Dude why did we used to think Jr's was the FNaF 2 location
<GOOD> Midnight Motorist pisses me off even if it's actual lore
<GOOD> FNaF 6 answers a lot more questions than it created
<GOOD> Possibly the only FNaF game to ever do that
<GOOD> Plus it has one of my favourite shock moments of this franchise
<GOOD> It's the full image of the Fruity Maze reflection easter egg
<GOOD> Is it even an easter egg idk
<GOOD> But it shows Suzie and William Afton
<GOOD> That little girl AKA the first victim of the Missing Children Incident AKA Chica
<GOOD> Chicago
<GOOD> Chicastay
<GOOD> Man stand
<GOOD> Man go
<GOOD> Watermelon
<GOOD> Watermelon Chica..
<GOOD> It's all connected
<GOOD> But yea that's Chica's spirit when she was alive
<GOOD> Likely a few minutes before she was murdered considering Afton is right behind her and talks to her about luring her away
<GOOD> Scott made up for it by making Cassidy look like a stupid idiot with a bowl cut
<GOOD> It's like, between 83 and 85
<GOOD> I think so but it's also a really funny image
<GOOD> The fuck you grinning about man
<GOOD> Green ass hair
<GOOD> Remembering how in the trenches we were during FNaF 2
<GOOD> People thought Pink Guy was not Purple Guy
<GOOD> Modern FNaF lore would kill a Vincentpilled FNaF 2-cel
<GOOD> I was 9 and I was following since the first day it released
<GOOD> I was in the fandom at that age
<GOOD> Dude if I explained to them how Shadow Freddy is actually a shape shifting clown animatronic made out of pure rage and anguish from William Afton (who is purple guy btw) they would fucking explode
<GOOD> They still had to put up with this fucker
<GOOD> It was definitely meant to be something normal but it wasn't one off
<GOOD> Shadow Freddy appears more than once in FNaF
<GOOD> He was very important in 3 his ass was luring the animatronics
<GOOD> That's the whole reason there's credence to theories of Shadow Freddy and Afton having some sort of connection or motive
<GOOD> And now the books are canon people propose that Shadow Freddy is Afton's agony given form and unconsciously helping him
<GOOD> It was inevitable
<GOOD> At least with the direction we were going
<GOOD> Talesgame was bound to happen, especially with Ruin
<GOOD> The Mimic was being set up as a general malevolent antagonist since just after SB, and imo Steel Wool had some idea of what they should do before that too
<GOOD> Burntrap still the singular thing I'd remove from this entire franchise btw
<GOOD> What a dogshit game
<GOOD> I agree btw lmao some of that shit kinda crazy
<GOOD> Stitchwraith should never be near the games
<GOOD> However Tiger Rock is really fucking funny because he's just a massive asshole and also it means that Fazbear just installed a giant tiger head inside of a tree for what basically amounts to no fucking reason
<GOOD> This shit will be good for ideas and creating stories and shit, let's put a giant tiger head in our Pizzaplex
Why
You're fired Edwin
<GOOD> Can we get rid of this hint from the FNaF timeline
<GOOD> I'm finally going in bros
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> It's a mega-resource
<GOOD> With timestamps and revisions
<GOOD> I've been revising the FNaF game order and I think I was almost completely wrong *again*
<GOOD> So ignore like most of the things I said
<GOOD> This is really starting to piss me off
<GOOD> Idk how I could have made such simple mistakes
<GOOD> I'm aware
<GOOD> But I'm just fucking up over and over again
<GOOD> It's really upsetting me atp
<GOOD> Because I'm just getting it wrong constantly even at the most basic level
<GOOD> Like when I said FNaF 1 comes before 2
<GOOD> And that ToysDCI wasn't true when I should have said I simply don't believe it rather than it being definitive
<GOOD> This shit was already solved almost a decade ago
<GOOD> This shit is consistent though
<GOOD> The timeline clearly shows that Fazbear and Friends is when the MCI occurred, which is before FNaF 2 in 87
<GOOD> And then FNaF 1 is later in the early 90s
<GOOD> It's incredibly basic
<GOOD> Everyone has made one
<GOOD> They're in different orders
<GOOD> But I don't know why I assumed the Withered animatronics were the Classic animatronics from 1
<GOOD> This *is* consistent though
<GOOD> The ppl that made conflicting timelines were simply wrong
<GOOD> It goes 83, Bite of 83 (Fredbear and Friends is established before this), MCI, DCI, Bite of 87, FNaF 1
<GOOD> The Classics are based on them but not them
<GOOD> However, they are implied to be possessed by the same children
<GOOD> *somehow*
<GOOD> It seems like William removed the corpses from the suits after the MCI to hide them, and then the Withereds were used for parts in the Toys (which is why I don't believe in ToysDCI), and then *after* that the Classics were made
<GOOD> Then the FNaF 1 pizzeria fails due to Fazbear's bad reputation
<GOOD> It also is somewhat agreed upon that both Fazbear's locations are the same building, which likely explains why the spirits haunt their new suits as well
<GOOD> Even if ToysDCI makes some sense I still disagree, even if thematically it would make a bit of sense
<GOOD> The DCI's only real effect is creating RXQ I think
<GOOD> Shadow Bonnie
<GOOD> Shadow Freddy is presumably the Agony of the MCI, so Shadow Bonnie is the Agony of the DCI
<GOOD> So I'm thinking RXQ is the reason none of them are acting right
<GOOD> Although they were already acting pretty wrong because of the MCI and stuff
<GOOD> They were already possessed before Night 5 and 6 so
<GOOD> Nvm I was kind of right
<GOOD> But I didn't think about it
<GOOD> I need to chart out the timeline with one of those cork boards
<GOOD> That's not a confirmed thing but I can see the vision
<GOOD> It's likely that's the case
<GOOD> The Puppet simply aided them to possess the original MCI suits
<GOOD> I believe there's retrofitting
<GOOD> Although it's kinda hazy
<GOOD> I don't think it's *canon* but it makes sense
<GOOD> Because the animatronics aren't fully destroyed until after the FNaF 1 location shuts down
<GOOD> Either way, the FNaF 1 animatronics are possessed by the MCI victims, as are the Withereds, but they are not the same animatronics
<GOOD> (and imo the Toys are also possessed by those same spirits, however I do not have as much evidence for this)
<GOOD> It simply makes more sense to me than ToysDCI
<GOOD> Ok I've hit a wall constructing my personal timeline but it is all ok
<GOOD> I finally got more FNaF knowledge
<GOOD> It's rlly funny how despite being possessed the Toys really have like zero importance
<GOOD> The OGs are absolutely the most important culturally
<GOOD> The Classics I mean, not the OGs
<GOOD> I think Mangle had a lot of an effect tho, ppl love Mangle and I do too
<GOOD> Although I don't rlly count BB as a toy
<GOOD> If he is then I guess you could make that argument bc people fucking hated him
<GOOD> This isn't rlly lore, however I've been learning more recent FNaF lore now and it's pretty interesting
<GOOD> I was on the sidelines for a while but I'm back in now
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> It's confirmed
<GOOD> Now I just need Switch 2
<GOOD> FNaF wiki waow
<GOOD> Minigame where you get mauled by a robot dog
<GOOD> I hope so
<GOOD> New
<GOOD> Also I feel like if you leak the Nintendo Alarmo before it releases you immediately become a reputable leaker
<GOOD> Even without his previous leaks
<GOOD> Like who the fuck leaks a Nintendo Alarm Clock
<GOOD> They trying way too hard #tbh
<GOOD> True, it's arguably one of the best games to overshadow with a big announcement
<GOOD> One of the most nothing releases
<GOOD> Plus it means they can massively oversaturate their advertising with Donkey Kong bc people are looking for the Switch 2
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I didn't see that
<GOOD> The trailer was horrific
<GOOD> It made me deeply uncomfortable
<GOOD> Good trailer
<GOOD> Also looks like the Joycon mouse thing is real
<GOOD> I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT WTF
<GOOD> It's based on the Arcade cabinet right?
<GOOD> Could be Feb direct and April Direct + release? Not sure
<GOOD> They were giving him all the attention before they took him out back and replaced him with this
<GOOD> NEW SWITCH 2 GAME
<GOOD> I heard they're electromagnetic or something idk I'm not smart
<GOOD> I don't think it would fall apart if you picked up the console by the joycon
<GOOD> Anyway I'm genuinely trying to understand what the fuck this is if it's an actual plan for a Mario Kart game
<GOOD> Why is it so BIG
<GOOD> I meant the track
<GOOD> I mean like, length dipper
<GOOD> That's a super long straightaway
<GOOD> And the road just like, keeps going
<GOOD> It curves then continues the way it's going
<GOOD> Like that's a very long thing for 1 portion of a track called a circuit
<GOOD> Even if it was a 3 section track
<GOOD> In Mario Kart? Absolutely
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> Even Luigi circuit has a straight path like half that length
<GOOD> Or shorter
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I don't know what that really proves but yea
<GOOD> Spoon I play Mario Kart constantly
<GOOD> I know how big a track usually is
<GOOD> It's not usually that big like ever
<GOOD> Mario Kart Nuts and Bolts
<GOOD> That one straight section is like half a map
<GOOD> In MK8
<GOOD> Like Toad's Turnpike would be about half over by that distance
<GOOD> (Plus if it's a circuit then it should connect together I think)
<GOOD> So it's gotta be a fairly big course
<GOOD> Mario Kart mostly has 3 sections for big tracks
<GOOD> Mario Bros. Circuit
<GOOD> Is what a figure 8
<GOOD> The track doesn't seem straight enough to make a figure 8
<GOOD> It gets all wiggly
<GOOD> Oh that makes perfect sense
<GOOD> If it curves that way
<GOOD> Tbf offroad is already a thing but I'd like that to be the gimmick
<GOOD> It being developed would be cool
<GOOD> Yea but offroad in those games are weird
<GOOD> Offroad stats so useless sometimes istg
<GOOD> Also I love Arcade/Seth Rogen Kong
<GOOD> I'm very happy about this
<GOOD> Those are just the 2 gimmicks of Sonic Racing Transformed
<GOOD> I really hope if offroad racing is a thing it doesn't affect how the cars control
<GOOD> The car control in MK8 is immaculate
<GOOD> I really hope with this and Wonder that they're trying to go this Direction with Mario
<GOOD> Love this style
<GOOD> Plus Bowser looks like an RPG design of himself lowkey
<GOOD> I wish I'd fully finished learning to drive but it sucked so badly
<GOOD> At least I don't need it
<GOOD> Also new thingy
<GOOD> My idea for Mario Kart gimmicks is either random or scripted Track Disruption
<GOOD> Kinda like Wonder Effects but one or a few for each track
<GOOD> That doesn't look like a Podaboo
<GOOD> At least to me
<GOOD> If it's a podaboo it would have to be some sort of guaranteed collectible
<GOOD> Like an item box that guarantees a specific item
<GOOD> I would agree with this however its position and the lack of anything else on the much slower side track implies to me that it's beneficial rather than a hindrance
<GOOD> Mario Kart usually puts item boxes on side tracks like that
<GOOD> Most likely
<GOOD> There's not really a reason not to
<GOOD> Could be but it's not a boost panel
<GOOD> So new item
<GOOD> Splatoon 4 Salmon Run will go crazy
<GOOD> I'm copping immediately
<GOOD> I'm not buying ZA for a bit probably
<GOOD> I'm buying Arms 2 when it's a day 1 launch title in a Switch bundle
<GOOD> I will buy the Arms special edition Switch 2
<GOOD> Smash but DK looks like this would be hilarious tbh
<GOOD> That arm hitbox would be lethal
<GOOD> Just realised they were gassing up DK so much because his rare design probably getting killed off
<GOOD> There is a KFC opening directly next to my house
<GOOD> This is some Eve and the apple type shit
<GOOD> I can literally see the building that it's opening in from my kitchen window
<GOOD> Getting home from a lecture that ends at 6pm
<GOOD> I love Feathers McGraw sm he's a feat of animation
<GOOD> Yea this fucking sucked from the team ngl
<GOOD> Like why would they do that
<GOOD> Pisses me off
<GOOD> Yea low-key this is a tipping point for me
<GOOD> I didn't care that Silksong was in development forever but you either give radio silence or dev letters or smth, not some ARG bullshit that isn't even true
<GOOD> I think I'm more excited for Ratatan now ngl
<GOOD> I can't back it BC it's kinda expensive but it's heat
<GOOD> I need to get into Dragon Quest
<GOOD> I've only played 1
<GOOD> I always do that with a new franchise
<GOOD> The game was fine but I needed to use a guide
<GOOD> I've heard I should play 8 or 3 remaster
<GOOD> But I can't buy 3 rn
<GOOD> Booby is awesome actually
<GOOD> Thanks Twitter
<GOOD> That is Candy
<GOOD> He is very silly
<GOOD> He is not a canon FNaF character so you don't have to know him
<GOOD> He is however now owned by Scott
<GOOD> Yeah but Candy's is also part of the Fazbear Fanverse Initiative
<GOOD> Scott legally owns all characters from the games encompassed within it for the purpose of merchandise production and official publishing
<GOOD> This also means he owns characters from the Fanverse where the game never got made/left the fanverse for reasons
<GOOD> Like Flumpty and Blam
<GOOD> I think it's also a legal thing bc one of the games being made was straight up a reimagining of FNaF 1, so Scott kinda had to have legal domain over it
<GOOD> (Even if that game isn't being made anymore)
<GOOD> It's rlly sad how the Fanverse went tbh it was a rlly cool idea
<GOOD> And it wasn't even Scott's fault this time
<GOOD> Cool banner tho
<GOOD> Plus the games that have actually released so far are decent, even if the flagship ones haven't released yet
<GOOD> At least 1 of the games has released and 3 of them are still coming
<GOOD> Even if the 1 game was released by someone that was chased off the internet immediately after for good reason
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> Not really a place for it in a 13+ server
<GOOD> Like from what I know it didn't serve a real purpose
<GOOD> Aaaaa I'm so excited for this
<GOOD> Yea I love Glitch shows in general and the trailer for this distressed me
<GOOD> Idk if there's a synopsis but I'm absolutely watching
<GOOD> New web show
<GOOD> I'll send the trailer one sec
<GOOD> Apparently Dana Terrace is an Owl House person, I haven't watched that yet tho
<GOOD> I wonder if it's like Fecto Elfilis in Kirby and the Forgotten Land
<GOOD> Yea I saw this one
<GOOD> I definitely think she's gonna be some sort of contained experiment that keeps the park running by existing somehow
<GOOD> She also looks like she's being shoved into an MRI machine for some reason
<GOOD> I still haven't unlocked Stuntman
<GOOD> Oh my ship is working out
<GOOD> Yea I watched the original Gojira movie literally 2 days ago and it's rlly funny to watch the harrowing commentary on nuclear war and politicians and then turn on Fortnite and see Godzilla use the Miku Miku Beam
<GOOD> I need to watch more Godzilla mogies
<GOOD> If there's one thing I love it's metal versions of characters
<GOOD> I adore metal fakers they're my favourite type of faker
<GOOD> Reminds me of this random image someone did
<GOOD> I definitely like Metal more than the others
<GOOD> What's your reason
<GOOD> True enough, I just like how metal versions of characters look and I think there's a lot of room to develop them
<GOOD> Idk I really like Metal
<GOOD> *Sonic
<GOOD> That wasn't specific enough
<GOOD> Godzilla
<GOOD> Peter Griffin
<GOOD> I think a lot of cartoons have a robot ep, I know SpongeBob does
<GOOD> Metal Mario probably counts as a doppelganger
<GOOD> Hmmm does Samus' doppelganger count as Fake or Metal
<GOOD> I assume it's Fake BC it's just a virus inside a suit
<GOOD> I also have a Metal doppelganger
<GOOD> Metal DJ is out there somewhere
<GOOD> I was referring to the one in Metroid Fusion
<GOOD> Who is also part biological
<GOOD> But I don't actually know if they're 100% bc they're just weird
<GOOD> Also every single Pokmon with a future paradox variant
<GOOD> I think Kamen Rider also has an evil robot faker guy? Not sure tho
<GOOD> Hmm I wonder if Wolf counts as a Bizarro Fox or if he's just a rival, I love Wolf
<GOOD> Team Star Wolf are my favourite StarFox characters
<GOOD> Oh wait doesn't Sol Badguy have a robot version
<GOOD> Oh nvm that's Ky
<GOOD> Lions vs Metal Lions
<GOOD> Also Sonic has so multiple different robot versions of him
<GOOD> One of them is a good guy
<GOOD> This guy
<GOOD> Although he doesn't rlly look like this anymore
<GOOD> But he's a good guy now
<GOOD> Right now he has a buzzsaw for a leg so presumably no
<GOOD> Just act like the server has been successfully taken over by lions
<GOOD> Because we lost
<GOOD> ~~Pretend it's a raid~~
<GOOD> Idk what version of Mechagodzilla I like more
<GOOD> Thinking about how lame King Kong is
<GOOD> He's so washed
<GOOD> No bc like how did you get that much mileage out of it
<GOOD> Go to sleep
<GOOD> He's literally just a big gorilla
<GOOD> For the majority of the latest movie he's literally just a normal sized monkey because there's more big monkeys
<GOOD> Like that's just a movie about normal gorillas when Godzilla isn't tgere
<GOOD> He's had movies made for like 50+ years now how much mileage are they getting out of it
<GOOD> That's Donkey Kong he's literally cooler
<GOOD> How are people still like, making movies about King Kong
<GOOD> I don't get it
<GOOD> Like what does he do in his movies
<GOOD> I was about to be so mad at you for this
<GOOD> I instinctively typed fuck you and then caught myself that's such a bad joke
<GOOD> I hate King Kong he's too gorilla like
<GOOD> Like he's a big ape
<GOOD> I know that's the idea but am I missing something
<GOOD> Ok nvm apparently he doesn't have movies made about him
<GOOD> I checked his movies and like half of them are just Godzilla vs Kong
<GOOD> He's farming clout by being around the GOAT
<GOOD> ~~also he kinda ate shit against Godzilla~~
<GOOD> He got like a Doomfist Gauntlet in that movie
<GOOD> And it just didn't do anything
<GOOD> He's literally not even bigger than Godzilla
<GOOD> He's just a large Gorilla
<GOOD> They pulled the neither of them win bullshit
<GOOD> I think
<GOOD> They just end up teaming up
<GOOD> Also I would like to state at this point I'm not actually mad nor do I hate King Kong
<GOOD> He's just kind of boring
<GOOD> He has the mileage for 1 movie
<GOOD> And then you start running out of ideas
<GOOD> Actually maybe 2 Skull Island was fine but it like barely had Kong in it
<GOOD> It was just Jurassic Park but with big animals
<GOOD> I don't remember but is King Kong meant to like, represent something in the first movie
<GOOD> Oh so it's just a conservation thing
<GOOD> I got one shotted
<GOOD> I agree actually
<GOOD> I like the metal plating
<GOOD> Heisei might be my favourite tho, they look impregnable
<GOOD> I mean that's just how Godzilla looks
<GOOD> Looking at me with those big ass eyes
<GOOD> I like Minus One Godzilla a lot
<GOOD> But the toku designs for Mechagodzilla are wayyyy better than Monsterverse imo
<GOOD> I've seen ppl make OCs/sonas that are kaiju
<GOOD> Although tbf a lot of Godzilla fans just treat Godzilla as their baby it's awesome
<GOOD> I actually find this Godzilla unsettling
<GOOD> He's kinda creepy
<GOOD> But that's a good thing
<GOOD> No because I've been playing the past 3 days and I haven't fucking had him spawn yet
<GOOD> Let alone getting him myself
<GOOD> Also I'm on the Mothra tier of the Godzilla pass rn
<GOOD> So I'm just trying to grind out Festival milestones by playing Vocals on Buddy Holly over and over and over again
<GOOD> Magical Cure  Love Shot is too hard to do for me
<GOOD> Like I can only do Bad Romance and Buddy Holly specifically on vocals
<GOOD> Because I spent a week feverishly grinding Bad Romance because I found it really funny bc of Story of Undertale
<GOOD> Not rlly it's like a few thousand per song
<GOOD> I haven't found any dumb creative maps yet
<GOOD> Cool Car Tycoon betrayed me
<GOOD> Fuck this is in reverse
<GOOD> I couldn't find the right gif
<GOOD> Tears of the Kingdom power that reverses shit
<GOOD> Oooh
<GOOD> I'll try it later
<GOOD> Rn I'm studying because I've been procrastinating far too long
<GOOD> Also because the lobby music for FN is driving me fucking insane
<GOOD> I'm thinkin Miiiku Miiiku ooweeooo I'm thinkin Miiiku Miiiku ooweeooo
<GOOD> I had to change it because I had Magical Cure Love Shot as the music before
<GOOD> I did until I bought Miku songs
<GOOD> I really wanna buy the banana shoes rn
<GOOD> This image sold me even if I don't own Kong
<GOOD> They had the back bling too
<GOOD> I really wish you could take the glove off so you can just play as a regular Gorilla
<GOOD> I have an 8bitdo but it's the Pro 2
<GOOD> Opened my gallery to blacken out my face on an image and saw this
<GOOD> This reminds me of that stupid Facebook memories video with the car crash
<GOOD> Nvm this one changed the audio fuck
<GOOD> The original one is funnier because it's just the piano music
<GOOD> Chat am I going crazy or is it normal to hear a dude growling like a dog directly in front of my face while trying to sleep
<GOOD> Scared the shit out of me I think I'm losing it
<GOOD> I googled it and apparently it's just like, a normal thing your brain can do?
<GOOD> And it's NOT a cause for concern???
<GOOD> Even though it's called fucking Exploding Head Syndrome
<GOOD> People suck at naming things
<GOOD> You bet it does
<GOOD> Shin Godzilla was peak
<GOOD> 3rd Godzilla movie I have watched is now my favourite
<GOOD> It was great
<GOOD> I've watched Minus One, Shin 2016 and the original Gojira
<GOOD> Deleted twitter
<GOOD> I think I'm gonna just heavily curate my reddit and bluesky for basic news about stuff I like
<GOOD> Black Stake Spectral Deck finally done DNA is so cracked
<GOOD> I used Immolate + Erosion for an early start then dragged myself over the finish line with DNA five of a kind aces + some random generic multers
<GOOD> Play UFO 50
<GOOD> Bought a dress because I fit in a women's small
<GOOD> Thank you TK Maxx I'm flattered
<GOOD> I also used the changing room for the first time and I wasn't given shit for it (it was the men's but I expected some bc uh yea)
<GOOD> It was one of those jumper dresses
<GOOD> Not a fan of the regular type like sundresses
<GOOD> At least for moi
<GOOD> My friend also bought me a Freddu Fazbear stress ball and these tinted red cosplay glasses
<GOOD> I have to buy girl shoes tomorrow
<GOOD> But apparently my size is big asf in women's sizes
<GOOD> Like, 11 iirc?
<GOOD> I'm a men's 9
<GOOD> So apparently that's a women's 11
<GOOD> I'm wearing the dress for my third Sonic 3 cinema viewing
<GOOD> My friend bought me red glasses and is lending me a trench coat, I may post the full fit on the day idk
<GOOD> I've been binging Godzilla recently
<GOOD> And I wouldn't usually rewatch movies so soon but uhhhhh Sonic 3
<GOOD> I have Godzilla vs Biollante next
<GOOD> I'm watching the Heisei movies
<GOOD> I watched Minus One, Shin Godzilla and Gojira then Return of Godzilla
<GOOD> Now I'm going down the list
<GOOD> Seems like some weird sea tentacle thing
<GOOD> Yes absolutely, just making sure I watch 1 continuity at a time
<GOOD> I watched Minus One first, loved it, then Gojira then Shin Godzilla
<GOOD> Then started on the Heisei stuff
<GOOD> Idk if Shin Godzilla has a set of movies but I wanna watch Heisei first anyway
<GOOD> That's minus one
<GOOD> Ok cool
<GOOD> Minus One is still my favourite rn but Shin is really close
<GOOD> I didn't expect to like it but it blew me away
<GOOD> I actually didn't at first
<GOOD> I saw the poster and was like it's trying too hard and then I saw it in action and its metamorphosis and stuff and then I was like waow
<GOOD> The pointy teeth were kinda strange to me
<GOOD> Mm it reminded me of the nightmare animatronics from FNaF w the face but I came around
<GOOD> And I'm glad I did the atomic breath is my absolute favourite so far
<GOOD> And the message was rlly cool
<GOOD> Yea that was one of my favourite forms
<GOOD> I love the blood it spurts
<GOOD> I watched the new Kong but I just didn't rlly like it anywhere near as much as the pure Godzilla movies
<GOOD> It felt a bit Marvel-y
<GOOD> Is that what Shin Godzilla wanted to do
<GOOD> I was under the impression he was just a force, like most Godzillas
<GOOD> Also The Return of Godzilla was like, ok
<GOOD> Not great
<GOOD> Definitely not bad tho it had its moments
<GOOD> Just confused me why there was a comic relief character and a spaceship
<GOOD> I think that would be the other way around bc like Shin is incredibly in pain
<GOOD> Or at least it seems that way
<GOOD> Yea Godzilla is just a force
<GOOD> Yea Minus One Godzilla is fucking angry, I like it
<GOOD> is the only Godzilla so far that I've seen that actively attacks stuff because he hates humans
<GOOD> Oh I know
<GOOD> But most other Godzillas just like, don't
<GOOD> They're just up to shit
<GOOD> I haven't watched one of those yet except I guess Return
<GOOD> But they never really show him as that evil he's still just like, walking around
<GOOD> They literally shoot laser cannons at him in that movie I'd be mad too
<GOOD> They sent the super sentai ass spaceship after him
<GOOD> I will say tho it's a bit jarring to watch the 3 Godzilla movies that are allegories for various struggles and tragedies and then be like but what if there was a Godzilla proof spaceship
<GOOD> Probably
<GOOD> However I also like this because Tokusatsu is awesome
<GOOD> And I like watching big monsters fight when King Kong isn't one of the monsters
<GOOD> Because tbh King Kong kinda sucks
<GOOD> Well yea
<GOOD> Scream if you love Godzilla
<GOOD> Oh also Minus One Goji having control rods for its back plates is fucking metal
<GOOD> I hope it's a permanent part of his thing from now on
<GOOD> I can't wait till I get to Mechagodzilla
<GOOD> I like Mechagodzilla
<GOOD> I liked that quite a bit however Minus One Goji being like this led to ||him being able to implode on himself in his death scene||
<GOOD> Which was awesome
<GOOD> When it's complete sure
<GOOD> I didn't bring my phone to the changing room unfortunately
<GOOD> It was 15 reduced from 40
<GOOD> I think I like clothes shopping
<GOOD> Quite a bit
<GOOD> I'm in my pajamas and taking ibuprofen
<GOOD> New fast food place opened in my town last week but someone was also stabbed outside there 3 days ago
<GOOD> Do I go it looks pretty good
<GOOD> My friend bought me a blind bag and now I have this for Sonic 3 viewing
<GOOD> I didn't have a stress toy when I went last time, I ended up squeezing my skittles bag so hard it tore open and almost spilled
<GOOD> I'll ping you when I do mine
<GOOD> And then my friend said are you really sure you aren't autistic because I kept shaking whenever Shadow was on screen
<GOOD> It's a Glamrock Freddy stress toy
<GOOD> I got it from a blind bag
<GOOD> Somewhat, I like it a lot
<GOOD> I got it today and I keep giggling when I look at it
<GOOD> Plus it's a gift from a friend which makes me smile
<GOOD> Plus Freddy's hat specifically is a really good fidget
<GOOD> It's like a joystick
<GOOD> Also chat do we fw the new glasses for my Shadow themed fit
<GOOD> They were cheap cosplay ones, very neat
<GOOD> Also ignore my hair I've been pulling at it
<GOOD> Epic WHAT NOW
<GOOD> Ladidadida
<GOOD> The lack of pixels is funnier
<GOOD> Viability should absolutely be influenced by player skill lol
<GOOD> Steve in Smash has like a billion broken techs, if you build a tier list around high level play you should assume the person reading the list is capable of being good at that character
<GOOD> there, fit check
<GOOD> Oh and  since she asked about the dress I think
<GOOD> True..
<GOOD> I'm throwing a Sephiroth looking leather trench coat borrowed from my friend on for the Shadow screening
<GOOD> I think it'll work
<GOOD> I'm an UTDR fan, I know Shayy
<GOOD> I think I've only watched a few of their vids tho
<GOOD> Only one I remember is the every fight is Sans run
<GOOD> Trans stuff rlly is hurdle after hurdle aaaaaaugh this starting to pmo
<GOOD> I thought I was done rip
<GOOD> I gotta go out and buy underwear later and complete the fit but I already went and did stuff today     why does everything have to be so difficult
<GOOD> My boxers are fine rn but like obviously not for a fem fit, I've been raised masc too long I didn't expect this to be an issue
<GOOD> I'm still gonna buy boxers probably, but I gotta buy smaller ones which rn seems lowkey difficult
<GOOD> I checked my labels and apparently my waist is XS
<GOOD> That shit might kill me
<GOOD> I'm definitely still buying boxers I just need smaller ones  idk enough about women's underwear to buy any
<GOOD> Plus like, I don't think I need to
<GOOD> I don't like many dresses
<GOOD> I assumed they'd be made for that, it's kinda ass if they aren't
<GOOD> That sucks
<GOOD> Ok there's a huge storm rn guess I'm not getting underwear till later
<GOOD> Ugh
<GOOD> Bit TMI but I need some a few sizes smaller than actually fit me bc uh
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Well I don't have another choice at short notice dude
<GOOD> They don't need to be REALLY tight, they need to be tight *enough*
<GOOD> Elastic super comfy but like I said I need more restrictive clothes which is why I'm going shopping later teehee
<GOOD> Hopefully it's just fine in general
<GOOD> Like I'll just buy XS and be like yay done
<GOOD> Ready for my screening
<GOOD> Ez
<GOOD> Sonic 3
<GOOD> My fit is red and black for Shadow
<GOOD> And my friend is going blue and white for Sonic
<GOOD> Ya
<GOOD> Also first time presenting fem in public so
<GOOD> Yea but that's why it's gotta be perfect
<GOOD> Also I'm not watching it in just my underwear
<GOOD> I want replica shoes
<GOOD> They're air shoes
<GOOD> I'm suprised that a women's Small dress fits me so well tbh
<GOOD> Like the sleeves show it's made for someone my height which is kinda crazy
<GOOD> My bestie is a godsend tho she's been teaching me about different trims of dress n stuff
<GOOD> I don't like like, regular dresses just more snug ones
<GOOD> A lot of dresses have low cuts which I don't think I'd like
<GOOD> Like I don't fw summer dresses
<GOOD> This one goes up to my neck tho so it's lovely
<GOOD> At least I got cute boots, but even the tiny heel made my balance feel funky lol
<GOOD> I'm so clumsy
<GOOD> Shirt and pants sounds reasonable for a wedding
<GOOD> Like a suit shirt
<GOOD> Maybe a tie
<GOOD> 20 reduced in River Island
<GOOD> I also massively overestimated my foot size
<GOOD> I am NOT a women's 11
<GOOD> 9 fit me just fine
<GOOD> Not exactly dainty but not much I can do lol
<GOOD> I'm only like 5'8
<GOOD> I kinda wanted a beret to finish the fit but I think I'm just gonna keep looking around for a red hat
<GOOD> I mean like it's reasonable, if someone asked me to wear a sundress I would probably say no
<GOOD> But yea I tried this 11 but my feet were drowning in it
<GOOD> I expected River Island to be super expensive but 20 isn't too bad
<GOOD> Then 15 for the dress and like 2 for the tights?
<GOOD> I'm thrifty
<GOOD> Do ppl actually wear kilts in Scotland
<GOOD> I thought that was a stereotype thing
<GOOD> Oh damn
<GOOD> That's kinda surprising
<GOOD> Dialga foot attack
<GOOD> Is the suit plaid or is the kilt black or do they just clash
<GOOD> Strange but understandable
<GOOD> I don't like plaid, I've been wearing it all my life unfortunately
<GOOD> I have so many shirts that make me look like a lumberjack
<GOOD> No I'm cozy in bed
<GOOD> I had an exam yesterday I probably did bad on so I'm giving myself a day off
<GOOD> Pampering myself
<GOOD> I do sometimes because it can work
<GOOD> I have like a billion pairs of jeans
<GOOD> Then some joggers and then t shirts
<GOOD> Ok that fucks
<GOOD> I like that
<GOOD> Maybe I just don't have good fashion sense
<GOOD> I need to doodle today maybe
<GOOD> These little red glasses are so cute it's a shame they aren't prescription and make it look like I'm in hell because everything gets a red vignette
<GOOD> I feel like you don't have a say in that one tbh
<GOOD> Like if you wanted everyone the same just have everyone wear a suit
<GOOD> Or a dress
<GOOD> Should be easy surely
<GOOD> Then they have a say in whether they go or not
<GOOD> Like wouldn't it just make more sense in photos to just group people by dress or suits rather than women and men if that's the issue
<GOOD> Feels weird to demand ppl to wear dresses tho, no?
<GOOD> Like formal is one thing, specific outfits is another
<GOOD> It's also just like, why would they be like you can wear suits but only if you're a guy
<GOOD> As long as everyone is formal it doesn't feel like it should matter
<GOOD> I think if I said you can wear sundresses but only if you're a guy a hell of a lot less people would show up to my wedding
<GOOD> Possibly because they wouldn't be comfortable doing that
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> Hopefully not the second if it's not hosted by queer ppl
<GOOD> I've heard some horror stories
<GOOD> Queers and STEM have suprising overlap
<GOOD> At least from what I've observed
<GOOD> My Marine Bio course is full of us
<GOOD> Uni in general too is a safe space for us often
<GOOD> Every society I've been to has been chill and most of the committee are in the community
<GOOD> Grug Crood
<GOOD> Full fit acquired
<GOOD> It's kinda uncomfy but not that bad
<GOOD> It's the same as before but now I have dysphoria kicking in yahoo
<GOOD> Yeah I'm fucking miserable again
<GOOD> I hate this
<GOOD> Fuck this man, I bought the wrong size and shit didn't work anyway
<GOOD> I'm just not gonna go
<GOOD> I'm so tired man
<GOOD> I want 1 day without some bullshit
<GOOD> Yeah but how I react to it is my fucking problem
<GOOD> Bc it's trans issues and I feel awful which is the problem
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> Bought a dress that hugs my body and I'm going out in it in 2 days and I realised an issue with a dress that hugs my body so I've been upset about it all day
<GOOD> I hate this
<GOOD> I bought new underwear to try and fix the issue but the issue wasn't solved BC I bought the wrong size and it also just fucking sucks in general and I'm this close to falling apart
<GOOD> I literally just wanna go out once and look nice and see a movie
<GOOD> Everything is so difficult
<GOOD> I don't have a skirt
<GOOD> I don't think I would want them
<GOOD> I already spent money on the dress and stuff
<GOOD> Like I literally can make this work but I just suck at this stuff
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I think I'm just gonna do my best to hide it and hope I don't get looked at
<GOOD> I'm rlly sad bc it's such a nice dress and tbh I'm crying rn because I've been struggling w trans experience stuff all week and I thought it was over
<GOOD> I'm at the end of my rope
<GOOD> I mean I am idle so I suppose but at the same time I fucking despise the OG of this image
<GOOD> However Big Boss is awesome
<GOOD> It makes me feel deeply uncomfortable
<GOOD> I don't have like a particular exact reason it's just really fucking weird
<GOOD> At least my shitty cosplay glasses are cool
<GOOD> I'm probably still gonna go out but I'm really just ugh
<GOOD> I wanted to draw an OC in this fit
<GOOD> Or based on it
<GOOD> The red part would be pulled up over 1 shoulder like a toga
<GOOD> He looks like an elephant
<GOOD> I don't know why but he just does
<GOOD> It's kinda both
<GOOD> Also implying all NBs look twinkish or whatever it feels fetishising
<GOOD> Also I didn't notice this but literally nothing changes between he/him and he/they lmao
<GOOD> He just turned around
<GOOD> I thought they had the same jeans tbh
<GOOD> And put on a black shirt instead of green
<GOOD> I wear those kinda of jeans
<GOOD> But yea the second it hits they/them
<GOOD> Yea I was gonna say all of them should just be the he/him image
<GOOD> Respectful version
<GOOD> Or just every single pronoun having every image
<GOOD> Why is DQ3 remaster 50
<GOOD> That's crazy
<GOOD> I'm definitely gonna start with like, 8
<GOOD> I've played 1
<GOOD> UFO 50 is like 19.99, you get 50 whole games in there
<GOOD> Bushido Ball is calling
<GOOD> It has Barbuta
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> Happy birthday
<GOOD> I don't think anyone has dw
<GOOD> Thinking about UFO 50 again
<GOOD> I want to play Mortol rn
<GOOD> UFO 50 is driving me crazy
<GOOD> Party House... Save me Party House...
<GOOD> Party rockers in the house
<GOOD> Single player ones go way faster
<GOOD> But I think it also saves after ifk
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> Have you not been keeping up with the new releases?
<GOOD> Also 6 and 7 have a lore reason to release before smh...
<GOOD> >it was labelled as newts so they didn't get fined
>Look inside
>Newts
<GOOD> Apparently the water care is remarkably similar but they need to install shelves etc for terrestrial stuff
<GOOD> I'm not a petcare expert tho
<GOOD> Also the beginner thing was a beginner to axolotls not in general
<GOOD> Afaik at least
<GOOD> Ikr I can't believe that pets have a subreddit
<GOOD> Neither should most animals but it's the situation we're in lmao
<GOOD> I don't see anything particularly wrong with a well kept axolotl
<GOOD> It's just a weird thing to be like ew, a subreddit for {animal}, like yea I can't believe that dogs have a subreddit with all that inbreeding going on
<GOOD> Yeah but in this case it's literally just dogs shouldn't be owned, it contributes to horrific breeding practices
<GOOD> Axolotls are at risk for various reasons, animal breeders in general fucking suck
<GOOD> Precisely
<GOOD> 0 frames of startup for this move it's BULLSHIT
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I've just been around enough breeders to see how shitty it can be
<GOOD> Also a family member wanted to get an axolotl and I spent a bunch of time telling her how difficult and not recommended it was teehee
<GOOD> Idk if she's gonna yet
<GOOD> I had a bearded dragon but he died last year
<GOOD> My dad was in charge of care but a mid sized enclosure, calcium(?) dust, locusts and things to do seemed like it went a lot of the way
<GOOD> It always got a bit stressful when their lightbulb blew tho
<GOOD> The first few weeks with our ball python was a lot more stressful
<GOOD> Yea but that isn't like huuugely difficult
<GOOD> Their baths are adorable
<GOOD> And their shedding they usually get most of it done on their own, they just need a bit of help for some of it
<GOOD> But yea our python is a lot more temperamental
<GOOD> If I had a rodent pet I'd want a chinchilla ngl
<GOOD> But I can't deal with any pet rn
<GOOD> So I'm just caring for moss balls bc they're comically low maintenance even for plants
<GOOD> Which reminds me I need to replace their water again today
<GOOD> If ppl were to dump them in waterways and stuff sure
<GOOD> That sounds plausible
<GOOD> Contaminated by what
<GOOD> Like you're saying it's not the moss balls so what is it
<GOOD> That makes some sense but also wouldn't all that water just be flushed and cleaned anyway
<GOOD> I feel like dumping water into the ocean instead of just, anywhere else is down to the person rather than the system
<GOOD> Probably a while
<GOOD> Marine animal eggs are pretty hardy in a lot of cases, or produced by the billion or both
<GOOD> I've only been rolling them, not eating them
<GOOD> No but I'm very tempted to split one in half and make an extra ball
<GOOD> I'm not bleaching my balls
<GOOD> They're safe in their container
<GOOD> Balls
<GOOD> They're green
<GOOD> What are you expecting me to say about how they look
<GOOD> I just got out of the shower
<GOOD> I got out when I came back, just got out of the shower is everything up until I'm done doing shower related activities
<GOOD> Currently I'm drying my hair
<GOOD> Here, the little one is a little fucked up
<GOOD> They sit on my desk in an unsealed pasta container
<GOOD> I've literally never had to do anything except change their water and roll them in my hands occasionally
<GOOD> I don't think so, sometimes I don't and they've remained more or less the same
<GOOD> It just helps them remain a uniform shape
<GOOD> The little one I haven't tried to roll too much bc I don't wanna irreversibly fuck with its shape
<GOOD> And whatever rolling I've done hasn't patched it up
<GOOD> Nothing
<GOOD> It just started doing that
<GOOD> I'm not even certain it wasn't like that originally
<GOOD> I've had them a few years so idk what they looked like when I got them
<GOOD> They were in a mason jar tho
<GOOD> I'm playing Party House I'm busy
<GOOD> Actually I'm watching someone play Party House
<GOOD> I'm like 5'8
<GOOD> That's not tiny
<GOOD> And a half btw
<GOOD> And a half
<GOOD> In fact I'm like 2cm off 5'9
<GOOD> Then I'm .75cm from being 5'8 and a half
<GOOD> UFO 50 is so good
<GOOD> I'm not even halfway
<GOOD> Actually Grayfruit did that
<GOOD> I watched him play Barbuta
<GOOD> Mm I only have 1 cherry and 6 gold carts in UFO 50
<GOOD> And I got the cherry by accident
<GOOD> Godzilla Minus One
<GOOD> Also the small sprites just remind me of that one area in Earthbound
<GOOD> Rage quit UFO 50 I ain't doing this
<GOOD> Might install cryptid mod Balatro I need to de stress
<GOOD> They can't stop you finishing it
<GOOD> How long is a marathon again
<GOOD> I've sprinted a mile full pelt before but I thought my friend was dead so that doesn't rlly count
<GOOD> Oh I've walked 12 miles completely exposed in summer before, I think I could jog 26 in under 6 hours
<GOOD> I think it was closer to 15
<GOOD> challenge run is going well lmfao
<GOOD> 5 eggs and no interest who give a fuck
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I got swashbuckler ante 1
<GOOD> Massive?
<GOOD> I just did it first try
<GOOD> Not doing some of the others tho
<GOOD> 15 minute city fucking sucks tbh
<GOOD> I hate Ride the Bus
<GOOD> Yeah but the challenge gives you extra face cards
<GOOD> So your hand bricks
<GOOD> And it's only +1 mult per hand so the scaling is awful
<GOOD> I know but then you have to either play dogshit or keep cycling your hand for anything serviceable
<GOOD> They even give you the straight gap thing to try and help but it just doesn't lol
<GOOD> Not if like 60% of your deck is face cards
<GOOD> If you want to play a flush you have to use practically every discard you have and if you're doing that you aren't feeding hands to Ride the Bus
<GOOD> It feels like Swashbuckler/Gros/Abstract completely destroy Ride the Bus in both short and long run
<GOOD> Believe me I played straights too when my entire hand wasn't clogged with face cards, and then I discarded 5 and got 5 more face cards
<GOOD> It is genuinely the worst joker in the game imo
<GOOD> Unless you have like some fringe Burglar + Abandoned Deck synergy it doesn't even scale
<GOOD> Like 3 so far, haven't gotten past the first few antes because I immediately get bottlenecked by having 3 usable joker slots
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure there's even better jokers that scale +mult easier like Trousers
<GOOD> Even in that precarious ass deck with so many face cards, Ripped Joker is probably better for your run than Bus
<GOOD> BC you're gonna be playing shitty hands trying to cycle through to Straights
<GOOD> It's not solved tho BC it's kinda ass
<GOOD> Like you don't generate enough mult even if you get it off the ground, bc if you get *good* hands chances are you're beating the blind immediately and getting the scaling fucked up
<GOOD> You are when half of your deck is face cards
<GOOD> Either way Bootstraps mogs
<GOOD> Sometimes yes
<GOOD> Later on yeah
<GOOD> But atp just run stuff that scales with small hands
<GOOD> It's just not a good joker
<GOOD> What's your worst joker
<GOOD> (also ngl if you want +mult scaling without playing face cards on small hands just run Shoot the Moon)
<GOOD> Nahr I like the stone one
<GOOD> It scales well with Hologram
<GOOD> Ride the bus doesn't have synergy so it's better than nothing
<GOOD> Yeah you should see how ppl look at me when I talk about my Dino deck flowcharts
<GOOD> I love using Dinos but haven't played in a while
<GOOD> I'd probably play Sprights now they seem cool
<GOOD> I used to play Master Duel
<GOOD> I prefer regular format greatly
<GOOD> HELP
<GOOD> Thinnest possible line to losing the run
<GOOD> If I can't fund a joker every blind I lose
<GOOD> Can't move the daggers around
<GOOD> It's the challenge run
<GOOD> I won btw
<GOOD> The daggers couldn't gain mult lmfao only the one on the right can
<GOOD> Currently at like +200 mult total with x7 mult
<GOOD> Ok gg
<GOOD> Yeah but dagger is gonna take 1 joker every blind or it kills Madness
<GOOD> Madness procs after dagger thankfully
<GOOD> Bc left to right
<GOOD> Knife's Edge doesn't allow you to move the eternal joker you get at the start, and apparently that also goes for all of its copies
<GOOD> I kept popping Ankh and it kept copying Dagger
<GOOD> And then I got Madness and cruised
<GOOD> My last attempt was uh
<GOOD> Frantic
<GOOD> The common joker machine kept pumping and the dagger kept scaling but it wasn't enough
<GOOD> I never get any cool Legendary Jokers
<GOOD> Always the Boss Blind disabling one which I hate
<GOOD> I got Perkeo early once but didn't get Observatory so couldn't start scaling planets
<GOOD> I don't think I've gotten Yorik ever
<GOOD> GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<GOOD> We're leaving Bounty in 2024 unfortunately
<GOOD> Drew a new OC and tried to convey their digital presence, now it just looks like a Pizza Tower mod
<GOOD> Well doodled I didn't want to draw smth polished today
<GOOD> Big women...
<GOOD> I love Moogles
<GOOD> I don't play FF but Moogles are so cute
<GOOD> However DQ slimes are even cuter
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> In a genetics lecture and shaking my head every time the lecturer talks about managing favourable genes so they know I disagree /silly
<GOOD> is there a name for the aesthetic on the left
<GOOD> Like, how the duck is styled and stuff
<GOOD> Thank you I was trying to draw smth in the style and needed a brush
<GOOD> is there Marth lore I need to know before this
<GOOD> Yeah but like do I need to know anything about his games
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Ok good
<GOOD> My Robin looks like this btw
<GOOD> I like her
<GOOD> I love this design she's adorable
<GOOD> I almost went with this but nah
<GOOD> Addicted to screentone after discovering how to do it today
<GOOD> It looks so crunchy I'm doing this from now on
<GOOD> On like most of my art
<GOOD> Doing it in order was tough but worth it
<GOOD> I passed 1000 for Blacephalon with charm and didn't get it
<GOOD> Yea I don't DA hunt anymore
<GOOD> I didn't beat it because I didn't want to do literally everything
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> As in 10x odds
<GOOD> I would if Heroes port was still available
<GOOD> Yeah but the port would be more convenient
<GOOD> My bestie thinks I might be autistic
<GOOD> Or neurodivergent at least
<GOOD> She went to watch Sonic 3 w me twice and now she's convinced
<GOOD> Although I think she had an inkling before
<GOOD> Spoon it's the NHS I wouldn't make that bet
<GOOD> We'd watched it separately once each but wanted to go together and she got concerned BC I cried 6 times and couldn't stop shaking when Shadow was on screen
<GOOD> She bought me a stress ball for the second screening we went to
<GOOD> It helped
<GOOD> Freddy Fazball
<GOOD> She was worried BC I broke the skittles bag I was holding when we first watched it together
<GOOD> I squeezed it too hard
<GOOD> Good movie tho
<GOOD> We both enjoyed all 3 times
<GOOD> It's just a FNaF ball
<GOOD> After the first time we watched it together we went to my place and watched 1 and 2 again
<GOOD> And after the 2nd time we went home and watched Mario movie
<GOOD> I'm gonna ask her to rewatch Dunmeshi w me I think because I love that anime and she hasn't watched yet
<GOOD> That's their loss to be honest
<GOOD> Everyone should have a stress ball
<GOOD> I like the part with 99 red balloons
<GOOD> Even tho it could have been a Sonic song
<GOOD> My bestie likes Knuckles the most
<GOOD> A few other friends came to the screening but they said Blaze was a super obscure character so I hid my power level around them
<GOOD> Apparently ||Escape from the City|| was in the movie but I couldn't hear it any of the 3 times I watched it
<GOOD> Anyway pointing at the ||Sonic Heroes formation|| in the theatre without playing Sonic Heroes teehee
<GOOD> Nobody
<GOOD> But Zavok is built like Broly
<GOOD> Dipper he's so deadly
<GOOD> I want one of those
<GOOD> I also need to continue watching Godzilla
<GOOD> Reading Dandadan is tuff because my friend is anime only and I can't talk to her about the cool fucking kaiju they introduce at some point
<GOOD> Best character ez
<GOOD> She's waiting
<GOOD> I'm not autistic but I do love Godzilla and Miku
<GOOD> They're goated
<GOOD> Yeah exactly
<GOOD> I think if I were less stingy I'd have the plush ~~autism~~ interest
<GOOD> Chat I need input do y'all fw The Mimic
<GOOD> Like this is raw
<GOOD> Fuck with (in this context it means do you like it)
<GOOD> I might make her a pfp
<GOOD> I'm suckered in by Wario-inspired games so easily
<GOOD> Ware or otherwise
<GOOD> Can I be the #1 Donkey Kong fan actually
<GOOD> Franchise, not character
<GOOD> But I fw Dread Kong so heavy
<GOOD> How I feel rn
<GOOD> I love the mocap DKC cartoon
<GOOD> Why did they mocap the Klaptraps
<GOOD> Literally
<GOOD> Have I yapped to you about Mindwave yet Bounty
<GOOD> Demo for new indie game
<GOOD> Quirky Warioware inspired game where the minigames are themed around your opponent's mind
<GOOD> This song has been stuck in my head all day
<GOOD> I love Abbie sm
<GOOD> Also IT REFERENCES RHYTHM HEAVEN
<GOOD> I like the little pop up gimmick
<GOOD> I think if someone Mindwaved into my brain it would have many popups
<GOOD> Actually fuck my level would be the 9 Volt level and it's just all my favourite games as Warioware microgames
<GOOD> Hold! And it's slamming the door on the Bidibabs in FNaF SL
<GOOD> Live and Learn!
Then it cuts to a meteor storm you have to navigate Shadow through
<GOOD> I was Mindwave yapping to my friend today and I told her every single microgame for me would be a speed up
<GOOD> She agreed
<GOOD> Dude I'd fuck up anyone in this universe I'd just start spiralling before the battle
<GOOD> I've seen both of them they're amazing
<GOOD> I'm a huge Warioware fan as well as Rhythm Heaven
<GOOD> I prefer the first one
<GOOD> First Peterware that is
<GOOD> Pick Nose
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> Do you like my pfp
<GOOD> I changed it
<GOOD> It's not Shadow anymore
<GOOD> Yeah I'm keeping Shadow until he's ripped away from me
<GOOD> I don't know why this gif has the controller but ignore it
<GOOD> I need to make a list of things I hate
<GOOD> Current list is Dr Mario and King Kong
<GOOD> Dipper I don't get it
<GOOD> Why do people like King Kong
<GOOD> And Dr Mario
<GOOD> No it sucks
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> That's what I've been saying
<GOOD> I mean the games not the guy btw
<GOOD> The guy was implicit
<GOOD> Like
<GOOD> I like the sprites and Metal Dr Mario that's it
<GOOD> Tbh I can't play Dr Mario
<GOOD> I can play Puyo Puyo
<GOOD> I do not like Dr Mario it does not make sense to me and feels bad
<GOOD> This game has Dr Baby Wario there is no qualification
<GOOD> Dr Ludwig does not have my best interest in mind
<GOOD> I should finish my every FNaF character tier list
<GOOD> Have you ever seen this image btw it feels like something that would be everywhere in Mega Man's fandom
<GOOD> Like the Feraligatr ass image
<GOOD> Gen 3 Feraligatr back sprite
<GOOD> Oh they're Sonic fans
<GOOD> That checks out tbh
<GOOD> I want to try Mega Man personally
<GOOD> But I've only played 1 and 2
<GOOD> 1 was fine, 2 was pretty good
<GOOD> I also played whatever game has the train guy
<GOOD> Train man
<GOOD> I did not beat it tho
<GOOD> I just saw train guy and was like hell yeah
<GOOD> I wanna cosplay this so badly
<GOOD> You can order the bear costume off Amazon
<GOOD> Ok wait it's literally the exact same suit
<GOOD> Maybe I should use it
<GOOD> God I wanna talk about FNaF now
<GOOD> Nya
<GOOD> I don't know anything about Kanye except when he went fucking insane
<GOOD> And the Golden Freddy thing
<GOOD> This fried me
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> His nitrous dealer had Golden Freddy as Ye's pfp on his phone
<GOOD> The bear suit is a reference to FNaF the musical btw
<GOOD> I really hope Mario Kart 9 top level is fun
<GOOD> Chat what do I remove for Cavendish
<GOOD> I'm playing pairs so I need chip gen, I don't think I can continue without it
<GOOD> Nvm I won
<GOOD> Yes but then I got greedy
<GOOD> guess who beat the Medusa challenge
<GOOD> I got Driver's License on the very first blind by skipping it and creating a random joker from the arcana pack btw
<GOOD> Btw I sold the egg and got over 100 mult on the bootstraps
<GOOD> Idk
<GOOD> None
<GOOD> need advice I'm on the run of my life rn
<GOOD> Do I scrap bull for trading card my chips can't exceed my money I think
<GOOD> Do you see the vision
<GOOD> Reminder I have Paradoilea
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I sold I don't regret it
<GOOD> 2 antes into having the card
<GOOD> *rounds
<GOOD> Getting scared
<GOOD> What do I sell
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> I'm not I'm on planets
<GOOD> My planets have good chips rn
<GOOD> Like, 140 on basic pair lmfao
<GOOD> I might have to send the pairs
<GOOD> SEND THE PAIRS
<GOOD> Yea I'm waiting for bootstraps
<GOOD> I got a holographic driver's license
<GOOD> Oh well
<GOOD> Only checkered
<GOOD> It just fucking sucks tbh I don't wanna play any of them
<GOOD> Gold stake is ass
<GOOD> Usually
<GOOD> That just isn't the problem lol
<GOOD> I don't care if it's easier tho
<GOOD> I don't play it because it sucks to play
<GOOD> How it feels to open a pack on ante 1 and get an eternal rental basic Joker
<GOOD> And then 3 more in the shop
<GOOD> And then you get a good scaling card but it expires
<GOOD> And it's still a rental
<GOOD> It's literally fucking RNG
<GOOD> Ante 1 shop 1
<GOOD> Ante 1 shop 2
<GOOD> Ok have I made my point yet
<GOOD> I'd take xmult on ante fucking 1 any day
<GOOD> Especially at +x0.25
<GOOD> Uh huh one sec lemme reroll for good jokers rq
<GOOD> Ohhh I seeee
<GOOD> With +0 mult?
<GOOD> Also just crippled my econ to prove this point
<GOOD> No scaling afterwards because I would die immediately
<GOOD> When like 4/5 of anything you get is completely unusable for half of the antes it does in fact suck
<GOOD> Did it again and didn't get any joker without any of those stickers
<GOOD> A non perishable xmult and a spectral pack on ante 1
<GOOD> it's not as bad as you think lmfaooo
<GOOD> Also even if not perishable, they can be rental and eternal
<GOOD> I do, if they're also rental
<GOOD> If only there was a stake that had eternal cards and perishable cards, but not rentals!!!
<GOOD> Almost like Gold Stake is dogshit
<GOOD> Uh huh
<GOOD> The skill of restarting my run again and again because my econ can't get off the ground
<GOOD> The most gold stakes won in a row, IN THE WORLD
<GOOD> Is like 16
<GOOD> If it were consistent you would assume someone would have beaten it
<GOOD> >Previously, I completed a 19 win streak
<GOOD> If I flip a coin 20 times and it's heads, that doesn't make the coin consistently heads
<GOOD> It's just an erroneous event
<GOOD> And luck is out of your control in Gold Stake
<GOOD> No econ, no rerolls, no favourable jokers, run dies
<GOOD> Because other stakes at least allow you to somewhat influence it with rerolls etc, whereas in gold stake half of the cards are unusable dogshit
<GOOD> Like yea yk what would really hit the spot rn? Rental Astronomer
<GOOD> Are you really taking 3 dollars a round on ante 2
<GOOD> I'm saying rentals
<GOOD> Rental jokers, the main part of gold stake
<GOOD> Just popped Polychrome tag on my first shop of the game for this btw
<GOOD> Ooo waow I love this game
<GOOD> Me when abysmal dogshit is tomorrow
<GOOD> Because I restarted like 4 times
<GOOD> Oooh I love these packs
<GOOD> I lost bc my econ got crippled btw!!!!!!
<GOOD> Runner is goated not in Ante fucking 4 when I have the joker that scales based on the amount of times you've played the hand
<GOOD> Couldn't because I was getting outscaled by blinds
<GOOD> Couldn't get erosion up because nothing gave me card destruction, couldn't boost up Hologram because I couldn't get cards because my econ was dead in the water
<GOOD> Well well well
<GOOD> xmult joker in Ante 2 kinda goated actually
<GOOD> Ok fuck this
<GOOD> 400 fucking k
<GOOD> This sucks
<GOOD> I couldn't generate any money because I had to scale hologram
<GOOD> And I was already getting like 0 dollars a round from any given thing
<GOOD> Yeah and I needed to keep scaling it
<GOOD> And I didn't get a single other joker without rerolling that actually did anything
<GOOD> I used some perishable shitty jokers like Lusty but they died
<GOOD> This stake is fucking awful
<GOOD> Interesting first blinds
<GOOD> LMAO HOLD
<GOOD> Do I even fucking bother
<GOOD> Also
<GOOD> I skipped
<GOOD> Who knew
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> My lineup was too fickle
<GOOD> SCREAM IF YOU LOVE ANAGLYPH
<GOOD> It's goated shush
<GOOD> Negative tag after 6 antes is like shooting heroin
<GOOD> Honestly there's so many good tags I don't mind it
<GOOD> Free shop tag is also goated
<GOOD> It does your econ for you
<GOOD> Also 25 dolar tag
<GOOD> Then ofc the hand lv up tags early can go foolish
<GOOD> Unless it's like straight flush
<GOOD> Rare joker is a gamble but worth, and if you're in a pinch you can go for poly or holo
<GOOD> Plus you don't have to stockpile tags you can just pop them as needed
<GOOD> Only if you're struggling with something specific
<GOOD> Honestly I pop tags early all the time
<GOOD> Nah some of those ante 1 skips go crazy
<GOOD> Anaglyph S
<GOOD> Abandoned and Black F
<GOOD> Yellow A
<GOOD> I should make a real deck tier list
<GOOD> Anaglyph in C...
<GOOD> Where is your whimsy
<GOOD> Anyway I'm almost ready to assemble my creation
<GOOD> The body, head and wings of images 1, 2 and 4 all go together
<GOOD> Then they turn into the 3rd image when riled up
<GOOD> Well it's more like a mech ig
<GOOD> The suit is the humanoid form, and if the pilot is knocked out it grows into a kaiju and flies around rampaging to protect it
<GOOD> I don't want a Griffith
<GOOD> Why drop stuntman this early
<GOOD> You could arguably do both
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> I don't think mobile Balatro displays chip
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I turned it on but also 2 jokers left aaaa
<GOOD> Stuntman and ??
<GOOD> I think I have to beat ante 12 for it
<GOOD> Oh that's why I haven't gotten that
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> I hate that genre
<GOOD> Sims Tuah
<GOOD> your apology form to Anaglyph is in the mail
<GOOD> I did skip early
<GOOD> I unlocked the voucher but I'm 3 mil off stuntman
<GOOD> I'm trying to use Plasma to break 100 mil
<GOOD> Sorry I got distracted
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> I probably will actually
<GOOD> btw for when you wake up
<GOOD> Look at who's disabled
<GOOD> The crimson vessel is off his shits
<GOOD> Also the hand reached 19 billion
<GOOD> (highest)
<GOOD> Now I just need the second director's cut voucher and I've completed my collection
<GOOD> I watched Spirited Away
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I LOVE CHIPS
<GOOD> It's plasma we all love chips
<GOOD> Mr bea
<GOOD> I love him
<GOOD> Why is he scared of women
<GOOD> I almost read this by accident
<GOOD> Also Marth sounds like a woman
<GOOD> I don't think it's Marth
<GOOD> what the fuck is the fire emblem again
<GOOD> It's just a jewel right
<GOOD> I pressed the A button after it was mentioned and it immediately flew into the foreground lmao
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I should play PoR
<GOOD> By buying it physically
<GOOD> *lightning crackle*
<GOOD> Also I got spoiled on the Marth thing today because I taunted as Lucina in Ultimate
<GOOD> Btw the DLC gate opened
<GOOD> Do I stay away
<GOOD> I meant getting stomped by DLC
<GOOD> Also I played Brawl today against a Meta Knight main and I kept beating him and now he's saying how awful he is and stuff
<GOOD> I can't win
<GOOD> Wdym
<GOOD> Irl and discord
<GOOD> Irl earlier, discord now
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Switch tuah
<GOOD> Also some of these Brawl characters were fun but I quit after like 10 MK matches straight
<GOOD> I hate fighting him
<GOOD> Just to shake it up a bit
<GOOD> I'm in a gaming club
<GOOD> We play Ult and someone brought Brawl
<GOOD> I'm bringing Melee next week
<GOOD> I used Lucas too he was fun
<GOOD> I'm not even good at Ultimate
<GOOD> God no
<GOOD> Brawl Wario was also fun
<GOOD> I also mostly liked Lucas because I kept spamming the Flying Orphan tech
<GOOD> What should I call it
<GOOD> I also still need to play Mother 3 but I'm busy
<GOOD> Well no that's not the tech
<GOOD> Fine flying chikd
<GOOD> I also tested Dedede against someone else playing Luigi and realised I had a chain grab on them
<GOOD> That shit was way too easy to do I let them go after the second one
<GOOD> I main Dedede in Ult too
<GOOD> Sometimes
<GOOD> Wolf is currently the guy I like playing
<GOOD> I like his bair and waddle dees
<GOOD> Yeah but not much
<GOOD> ~~Because he didn't play much~~
<GOOD> We weren't tryharding it was chill
<GOOD> Nobody was a high tier in Brawl
<GOOD> Every mid tier is just a low tier
<GOOD> Because they have to fight Meta Knight
<GOOD> I used his up b and saw the pearly gates
<GOOD> That move sucks in Brawl
<GOOD> Why does he tumble like that
<GOOD> I also had a match I won despite losing 2 stocks to using Marth's final smash
<GOOD> Which killed me immediately
<GOOD> I used it on Green Hill Zone midstage and it killed me
<GOOD> Because I just flew into the blast zone and died
<GOOD> C is mid tier actually is cope tbhtbh
<GOOD> B is mid tier
<GOOD> Yeah because Meta Knight exists
<GOOD> You can't ignore MK
<GOOD> I heard he was legal
<GOOD> For like most things
<GOOD> Well yes
<GOOD> Do ICs move down
<GOOD> Bc they don't have the kills Meta Knight thing
<GOOD> Like they have handoffs but that's it
<GOOD> They're a solid character otherwise I think
<GOOD> But not amazing
<GOOD> They don't look particularly bad
<GOOD> They can't wobble in Brawl
<GOOD> I shall
<GOOD> Yea I saw that today it was funny
<GOOD> Pit was also funny
<GOOD> I used his final smash and just kept saying GO MY GOBLINS
<GOOD> Does Chu even have a positive MK matchup
<GOOD> I don't think any character does
<GOOD> This game sucks
<GOOD> I kinda suck tho
<GOOD> I don't rlly care tho BC I don't play it much
<GOOD> We talked about that today but with the mkwii community
<GOOD> Becoming a fire emblem fan sucks because now I have to talk to Smash players about Fire Emblem
<GOOD> Holy FUCK
<GOOD> No it's FNaF, Bountt
<GOOD> It's C   U
<GOOD> This is one of the worst FNaF #retro games tbh
<GOOD> They can grab him and kill him
<GOOD> That's kinda their thing, no?
<GOOD> I thought they had that on everyone
<GOOD> You still lose a stock if you get grabbed
<GOOD> Ok that's stupid
<GOOD> They definitely do
<GOOD> Like they don't have this against meta Knight they absolutely do
<GOOD> You just have to get your hands on him
<GOOD> He escapes handoffs?
<GOOD> This is absurd
<GOOD> I know they don't have a winning matchup, I'm saying they can grab and kill him
<GOOD> I'm not entertaining this conversation
<GOOD> Did you know Bowser is actually a winning matchup against Meta Knight because if you don't let him hit you he's really good
<GOOD> Are you bad at the game, dipper..
<GOOD> Then why are you saying Bowser loses
<GOOD> He clearly just has to land more hits than his opponent
<GOOD> ICs have to land 1 grab to kill him btw
<GOOD> One contact and the stock is gone
<GOOD> Ok then why are Icies good
<GOOD> Surely everyone else can just not get grabbed
<GOOD> ICs is a losing matchup against everyone
<GOOD> Because if you don't get grabbed they suck actually
<GOOD> That's literally why he's tiered above ICs
<GOOD> I'm not saying ICs are a better character than Meta Knight, nor am I even saying it's a winning matchup
<GOOD> I'm saying that ICs can in fact grab Meta Knight and kill him
<GOOD> Which does affect the matchup even if you want to pretend no Meta Knight is ever touched ever
<GOOD> Dude are you reading what I've said
<GOOD> You're really starting to get frustrating with this
<GOOD> Let's play a true or false game
<GOOD> Can Ice Climbers kill a Meta Knight, from 0, by grabbing them
<GOOD> Interesting
<GOOD> Are handoffs percent dependent?
<GOOD> Ok yeah I shouldn't have bothered
<GOOD> Please don't try and piss me off on purpose
<GOOD> B tier
<GOOD> Because I think the comparison is apt
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> Idk I asked Dipper a yes or no question and they said no to an objective yes so probably
<GOOD> You said he can not get hit ever by a move
<GOOD> Like, as in handoffs shouldn't be considered in that matchup because you can't ever land an attack
<GOOD> And a very competent IC will hit him anyway
<GOOD> Because they're better
<GOOD> Because he is harder to grab
<GOOD> And he's Brawl Meta Knight
<GOOD> Acting like he's impossible to grab is just incredibly strange
<GOOD> Like no, objectively speaking he is not
<GOOD> Nearly?
<GOOD> Very interesting
<GOOD> I'm done
<GOOD> I like these things
<GOOD> Idk why there's a Smash symbol
<GOOD> I think I picked 2 of the best characters in this game by accident when I played Arms
<GOOD> I didn't pick the first and second best character but I think I picked the best character and a high tier
<GOOD> Dr Coyle is cool and also attractive
<GOOD> Byte and Barq in Smash would have gone crazy
<GOOD> I didn't pick Max Brass tho I don't like him
<GOOD> I picked Dr Coyle and Springtron
<GOOD> Max Brass fucking sucks to fight tho
<GOOD> Same as Hedlock but he's not playable
<GOOD> I really want to get out of bed and make shitty frozen potato waffles at 10pm instead of sleeping
<GOOD> I'm hungry
<GOOD> I wish I could play Asura's Wrath
<GOOD> Black coffee is so rancid
<GOOD> I got Americano pods with my machine and I had no other coffee today so I tried a sip and had to swill it out
<GOOD> My collection is finally complete
<GOOD> Batro
<GOOD> It's a joke but I'm missing the second Director's Cut
<GOOD> are you available for Balatro stuff
<GOOD> Do I sell 6s for Sock
<GOOD> My cat is at 12x
<GOOD> All spades for flushes and luckies
<GOOD> I guess retriggered faces double lucky chance anyway
<GOOD> Imma sell it's gonna pop
<GOOD> Yea I decided
<GOOD> Awesome 3D
<GOOD> Alternatively this
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> That's why I said alternative
<GOOD> Sorry Bounty roguelike deck builders are in rn
<GOOD> Wait Spoon do you have UFO 50
<GOOD> You need to play Party House it's awesome
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> It's a roguelike deckbuilder
<GOOD> It's very fun
<GOOD> It makes gambling seem very stressful
<GOOD> Yeah because in Balatro it's not that bad
<GOOD> But in Party House I'm mad stressed when I draw 2 Wild Buddies but need more Pop and there's dogs in my deck
<GOOD> Bc like it might be safe but it might not
<GOOD> I want to get into Transformers now idk what to do tho
<GOOD> It insists upon itself
<GOOD> I might watch the Bad Guys today BC I never ended up watching it
<GOOD> I watched Puss in Boots the Last Wish and Transformers One yesterday finally
<GOOD> Oh right I still need to try Castlevania
<GOOD> Is this that one people really like
<GOOD> Actually is this Castlevania
<GOOD> 2 sentence horror
<GOOD> locked in my build at like Ante 4 I basically just completed that one challenge but on Black Stake yellow deck
<GOOD> I just kept playing Pairs so I had like a lv 16 Pair
<GOOD> But I couldn't stall on Blinds because the Madness + ripped joker boosted me through everything except Purple Vessel
<GOOD> Then I just popped a lucky card at the end and won
<GOOD> I'm thinking about FNaF again
<GOOD> I keep thinking about Funtime Foxy being a taxi driver
<GOOD> Even if it was a dream sequence
<GOOD> It's while Minireenas are crawling inside the guy while he sleeps
<GOOD> Or why a game that's bad is misunderstood
<GOOD> I also wanna draw smth now
<GOOD> I also want Megatron in Fortnite now
<GOOD> But he hasn't been back in a year
<GOOD> Oh I remember this guy
<GOOD> I can't play it
<GOOD> I love him
<GOOD> He has aura
<GOOD> Robots
<GOOD> We heart robots
<GOOD> Idk shit about dinosaurs
<GOOD> Prehistoric fish go hard tho I love the ones that had armour
<GOOD> And the armour was shit so they stopped doing that
<GOOD> Fish gave up on armour and just started being mad fast and I think that was the play
<GOOD> I've seen a few fish dissections and it's really funny to see how soft their flesh is on their belly compared to the rest of their body
<GOOD> Well their underside
<GOOD> 6 hour fieldwork after 3 hours of lectures on Monday
<GOOD> At least I get to look at cool animals
<GOOD> The Man in the Suit:
<GOOD> What do you MEAN I'm citing a paper written in 1778 in Spanish with no translation
<GOOD> I heard med students can be really egotistical
<GOOD> Not always but it's what some people are in the field for
<GOOD> Did he have an interview?
<GOOD> I'm still saying that many med *students* will be like that
<GOOD> Whether they get filtered later is debatable
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I'm so done w my flatmates
<GOOD> It's straight up inconsiderate atp I'm not a maid
<GOOD> I replaced the bag for the food bin, it fell in because of the weight and they just started to put stuff on top of the now crumpled bag
<GOOD> Like are you stupid
<GOOD> They've also started piling stuff outside of the bin
<GOOD> And just leaving giant empty pop bottles everywhere
<GOOD> Like it takes 5 minutes just fucking do it instead of being drunk all the time
<GOOD> Yeah I've only done it almost every single time and also cleaned the entire kitchen top to bottom when we started to get infested with flies
<GOOD> I don't have a friend here
<GOOD> It also pisses me off when people use the filter side of the sink for food you don't want to filter
<GOOD> Like noodles and shit are just there
<GOOD> And I'm not cleaning that shit
<GOOD> Anyway today's agenda is to go shopping, do some more work, watch Ted show and draw
<GOOD> Maybe think of a Chainsaw Man OC
<GOOD> We don't have anything else going on unfortunately
<GOOD> I wanna draw but the moodboard is scaring me
<GOOD> I don't wanna draw these frilly dresses
<GOOD> I played Melee yesterday btw
<GOOD> I unlocked Marth and am going to unlock the rest for the ppl at the gaming club
<GOOD> I also wanna think about FNaF again
<GOOD> Also I'm not entirely certain all of my flatmates are even back
<GOOD> I've only seen 3 of them
<GOOD> Like I suspect they moved out
<GOOD> Also I finally have a Welsh friend
<GOOD> Although they do not speak Welsh very well
<GOOD> Ik
<GOOD> My best friend is moving in next year
<GOOD> We had her sign up for a room literally the hour it was possible bc she wants to get out of her place
<GOOD> No idea whose room we stole tho
<GOOD> They probably should have rebooked if they wanted it tho
<GOOD> Our accommodation gives like, a grace period for current tenants to rebook
<GOOD> It's a nice place
<GOOD> I also have another new friend and they told me they were non binary so I immediately popped a high five on instinct
<GOOD> I don't give people high fives usually
<GOOD> I did in Mario Kart
<GOOD> It wouldn't work on them
<GOOD> How it feels to hit a fellow enby with my enby magic
<GOOD> Spoon can I have your thoughts on this design btw
<GOOD> I'm trying to get a consensus
<GOOD> Ok that's what I thought
<GOOD> Do you think it would be fine if the eyes were replaced
<GOOD> And maybe the claws blunted
<GOOD> It's the general vibe of the game
<GOOD> I hear the game is fantastic albeit difficult or otherwise confusing
<GOOD> This is one of my personal favourite fangame designs
<GOOD> At least recently
<GOOD> OG Candy and Popgoes both capture OG FNaF very well tho
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> That's why I think this design is good because it still shows its seams because it's a 1983 animatronic
<GOOD> Fredbear's is still rudimentary and the tech is too at this point so it's a much chunkier, large animatronic
<GOOD> Then when you get more modern you get Candy's/Mary's type animatronics that are eerie
<GOOD> Mary's Arcade has such a perfect vibe
<GOOD> Especially because it doesn't have a door mechanic which can be rough but they pull it off well by mimicking TJoC's living room gameplay
<GOOD> It makes things very tense
<GOOD> I just like Mary's because they look like normal animatronics
<GOOD> And they become creepy only when in this liminal situation
<GOOD> They barely even look at you but the few times they do it's very strange
<GOOD> Whoops I sent the same image
<GOOD> But yea probably the best type of FNaF horror
<GOOD> And when they finally get to your office you have to stare them down
<GOOD> I think that works because the animatronics aren't like, fully real as far as I know
<GOOD> I ironically think TJOC is one of the few times the overdone designs are done fine
<GOOD> That may be my bias tbh
<GOOD> The new tjoc looks fantastic
<GOOD> Plus it has Bonnie punch
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> A lot of fangames are cropping up
<GOOD> Also what's your number 1
<GOOD> Also I don't know much about Jr's but these designs are like, so dubious to me because how would this be made for kids
<GOOD> Bro is just real
<GOOD> I don't remember if these are meant to be real or hallucinations
<GOOD> Was it the FNaF 2 one
<GOOD> I wanted to download Roblox for that
<GOOD> A Bite at Freddy's is my favourite fangame for now I think
<GOOD> Among Us
<GOOD> You have to freeze one of like 2 or 3 Animatronics in place on the cameras so they don't come to your room at the same time
<GOOD> And then stare at them until they move away
<GOOD> And they have long ass cooldowns for the things, like luring them 1 camera back
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> OMG OMG OMG NEW ART
<GOOD> I had a strange dream last night and it was very stressful
<GOOD> All of my nightmares are stressful
<GOOD> They're all serving
<GOOD> I don't like Frye
<GOOD> Big Man is my favourite
<GOOD> Pearl is my favourite idol overall tho
<GOOD> I'm in my nostalgia era  I'm coming to terms with the fact I'm old
<GOOD> I used to rule
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah
<GOOD> I still have mine from the mystery gift back in the day
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> If you have -5 dollars you have +-2 mult obvi
<GOOD> The math checks out
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Also I'm up to Orange on Yellow deck
<GOOD> Photochad again :<
<GOOD> Insane crutch
<GOOD> I popped Luchador for Verdant Vessel or whatever tho so
<GOOD> Same I just beat Orange Stake
<GOOD> Crazy run
<GOOD> Yellow gold stake next
<GOOD> Gold stake done
<GOOD> Thank you Yorick
<GOOD> I'm almost at my 3rd gold stake win raaaagh
<GOOD> But then it'll slow down ig
<GOOD> I beat Yellow and Checkered and now I'm at Orange on Ghost deck
<GOOD> I just beat Purple
<GOOD> In fact I beat it because of 3 consecutive Lucky card procs
<GOOD> I was blessed
<GOOD> I might splurge and buy some Night Nurse today
<GOOD> I need it
<GOOD> I'm worried about Abandoned Deck
<GOOD> Yeah I usually sleep that shit off
<GOOD> Night Nurse is the hard stuff
<GOOD> But last time I took Night Nurse I passed out and woke up completely cured
<GOOD> I need like, drowsy headache meds or smth
<GOOD> Bc I can't sleep and I'm running a fever
<GOOD> I've been rlly warm for like 3 days now it sucks
<GOOD> I'm going to Asda
<GOOD> Oh also Spoon did you see this run
<GOOD> Precarious and sinister
<GOOD> My banana exploded
<GOOD> I had to use the Acrobat because no Cavendish
<GOOD> Also I only won because I hit the fattest Immolate of my LIFE for Canio
<GOOD> I hit like 5 face cards at once
<GOOD> MORE CHICKEN AND MICROWAVE RICE RAAAGH
<GOOD> Thank you Morrisons Veetee rice sale
<GOOD> Nah I also bought some chicken spring rolls on sale
<GOOD> I'm simply eating hearty while I'm sick because I deserve it
<GOOD> Filling
<GOOD> I also bought some Hobnobs
<GOOD> Chicken is British food?
<GOOD> Balatro
<GOOD> She looks young up close tho wdym
<GOOD> THE MIMIIIIC
<GOOD> Can I have the FNaF trailer
<GOOD> I heard there was gonna be SotM news
<GOOD> I just saw it I'm shaking
<GOOD> Oh my god this may be my new favourite animatronic design
<GOOD> I want a new plushie
<GOOD> I want a Tiger Rock plush
<GOOD> I've found my way onto FNaF Tiktok it sucks
<GOOD> I love my bed
<GOOD> I've been sleeping on it recently tho
<GOOD> Also my bestie drew my OCs yesterday we're so back
<GOOD> I love when ppl draw my babies
<GOOD> Her OC is in the right of the last image but that's about it
<GOOD> The other 3 are mine
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Like aughhh everyone there just does this
<GOOD> Like dude you haven't been with the series in the last 7 years??
<GOOD> Ik we thought Glitchtrap was Afton when HW released too but by like, Ruin a year ago we basically knew it was The Mimic definitively
<GOOD> Even tho we thought it was gonna be The Mimic before that confirmation
<GOOD> Who is your OC
<GOOD> They recently switched up on it
<GOOD> Especially because SotM and HW2 update and RUIN forced them to
<GOOD> Tales is literally canon
<GOOD> Like you can't say it isn't anymore all of that happened
<GOOD> And GT knows that
<GOOD> Like this is the most irrefutable direct evidence I have seen in a FNaF game in a LONG time
<GOOD> It frustrates me that ppl still use Matt's ultimate timeline btw I don't agree with most GT Theories
<GOOD> Especially bc the timeline doesn't make any sense-
<GOOD> FuhNaff's is better although still embellished ofc
<GOOD> My GT hot take is that I think they were cooking with Dream Theory when 4 released, people just hated that it was a plausible theory
<GOOD> But I think Scott was angling for it originally
<GOOD> Well yeah 4 is a nightmare lol
<GOOD> Or at least hallucinations
<GOOD> But Dream Theory was that EVERY game was a nightmare
<GOOD> We already knew 4 was
<GOOD> The theory posited that the ScottGames hints were leading them towards the prior games being BV's nightmares
<GOOD> The Toy Chica hint especially
<GOOD> Most likely that she did the Bite or whatever, it didn't rlly become important which is why I think Scott originally intended for it to be used for Dream Theory
<GOOD> Same as the other 2 hints
<GOOD> It doesn't matter tbf
<GOOD> One of them did
<GOOD> Yeah that's why people didn't like it
<GOOD> But I still think Scott led Matt to that theory to test the waters on how ppl felt about it
<GOOD> They've had that long to learn literally anything about The Mimic
<GOOD> The Mimic is quite literally one of the most explicitly written characters in the series too
<GOOD> Like we know everything about it and ppl are like who is this guy
<GOOD> I still think that there's something slightly simmering underneath but nothing remarkable yeah
<GOOD> I adore the Mimic personally but I think that it's still malicious despite just copying ppl
<GOOD> I think Edwin's Agony seeped into it and now it's malevolent to some degree, even if it's still just following orders
<GOOD> But that's somewhat baseless
<GOOD> Yeah but Agony leads to sentient beings
<GOOD> If The Mimic simply learned violence as a learning robot from Edwin then it would still just be a robot
<GOOD> Whereas something like Eleanor has been shown to fuck with people on purpose because they're explicitly an evil formation of Agony
<GOOD> It's not possessed obviously
<GOOD> But like yeah it's a bit of an anomaly
<GOOD> It exists as a program rather than just The Mimic
<GOOD> It's theoretically everywhere in Security Breach we just don't know how deep its roots got planted by being The Storyteller
<GOOD> The endo's direct effects seem minimal in SB because MXES kept it sealed away, but we don't know its effects as a program
<GOOD> I still subscribe to the theory that the Endo nursery means that all the endos in Security Breach are running the Mimic program
<GOOD> It's based on the Endo storehouse + The Storyteller + the HW2 minigame where you teach the Endo how to be a specific animatronic
<GOOD> It's also because of like, Vanny teaching The Mimic to be something more developed in the note room
<GOOD> She got corrupted by The Mimic program when she was playtesting Help Wanted
<GOOD> Yeah she was there to basically just resurrect it, or at least be the means to an end
<GOOD> Burntrap ending isn't canon but it's shown to be at least part of Vanny's intentions
<GOOD> Yeah but not like, the full extent of it
<GOOD> Glitchtrap is just one effect of the Mimic program being used, it seems to be in every nook and cranny of the Pizzaplex
<GOOD> Every animatronic, room and game
<GOOD> Yeah but if Fazbear are still using a learning program to teach every endo, I think it's pretty obvious that we have something going on
<GOOD> Especially because you can see the defaced Vanny murals in the Endo nursery
<GOOD> Which was what Vanny was trying to do for the Mimic
<GOOD> I think The Mimic has already been spread across the Pizzaplex for corporate shortcuts
<GOOD> And they don't rlly realise what that implies
<GOOD> At least I think that's part of what The Storyteller, Tiger Rock etc was trying to tell us
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Yeah same as when Vanny ordered The Mimic to the Pizzaplex (implied) and they used it to disassemble robots
<GOOD> And then it turned on them and eviscerated the workers and then a group of children
<GOOD> It all seems to point to the same like, intention
<GOOD> Honestly the whole sticky note thing is the most unclear Scott has been about the Mimic, which is kind of insane because it's not even that vague
<GOOD> I mean it eviscerated the workers because it was taught to rip off endo head and arms
<GOOD> And then it did that to the people when it ran out of endos
<GOOD> But yes it most definitely learned William stuff because Glitchtrap exists
<GOOD> Also imo Glitchtrap implies that William was doing murdery things even before '83
<GOOD> I've seen that theory passed around a little simply because The Mimic knows to look like what was presumably the original Bonnie suit for Fallfest
<GOOD> I mean it could have learned its behaviour from the hyperbolic stories Fazbear made up for HW
<GOOD> But it presumably has seen that yellow rabbit suit before
<GOOD> And that suit didn't exist at any pizzeria we know of
<GOOD> So it probably either saw it at Edwin's warehouse or beforehand
<GOOD> Either way it specifically used that suit to lure you around the simulation, like behind the curtain so it either made that connection between the new and old animatronics itself or alternatively William was already doing shit in that suit
<GOOD> Either theory is plausible
<GOOD> Phisnom
<GOOD> That doesn't make sense to me
<GOOD> I think we're just some nameless contractor
<GOOD> June
<GOOD> My bday is the 26th June
<GOOD> Which is also the date of the MCI
<GOOD> Yeah there's no excuse lol
<GOOD> The song pisses me off even if it's funny
<GOOD> This kinda goes crazy
<GOOD> The Michael Afton song might be my favourite of his tbh
<GOOD> BC it's not entirely obvious it's satire
<GOOD> The Baldi song is also up there tho
<GOOD> Their recent Moo Deng era has been fantastic tho bravo Xtratuna
<GOOD> One?
<GOOD> My goat is in his Moo Deng era
<GOOD> Yeah that one is heat
<GOOD> I fucking love this one
<GOOD> It's like the first one he made
<GOOD> There's also a Burntrap one and it's like the only one without subtitles
<GOOD> And it's completely incoherent
<GOOD> I wonder what peak is on the menu today
<GOOD> Also Do not try to hide, you twisted fucking maniac goes hard tbhtbh
<GOOD> What is Tally Hall
<GOOD> Oh also this goes crazy
<GOOD> It's incomprehensible
<GOOD> Have you heard his older Mimic song btw Villy
<GOOD> It's honestly a lot more funny subtly than the other one but both are hilarious
<GOOD> Please do and lmk when you get to the part that's an outlier
<GOOD> It's peak
<GOOD> Also the fact it's called Hotel of Madness and talks about some hotel that apparently exists in the Mimic's lore when there hasn't been a single hotel in FNaF literally ever
<GOOD> I don't think this is the same hotel simply because the dude was just like just an idea! In the comments
<GOOD> Also the Mary had a Little Lamb sample with the slowly randomly rotating Mimic model is peak
<GOOD> There's a Nightcore version of Jackie's Box
<GOOD> Chazington video editing
<GOOD> Watchog is cool
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I was alerted
<GOOD> I also bought a thing on Etsy
<GOOD> >Mortal Kombat
Evil has won
<GOOD> Informative but I already knew this
<GOOD> Lol
<GOOD> If you beat 1 deck's first stake you've done the easiest run
<GOOD> Minus like, Checkered Deck white stake
<GOOD> Rn there's like 10 decks each with a good few stakes
<GOOD> *8 stakes on 15 decks + challenges
<GOOD> Depends on your definition of it
<GOOD> I beat Balatro on my 2nd run and I'm not even halfway done yet
<GOOD> Was doing Erratic Deck red stake yesterday
<GOOD> *green stake
<GOOD> Oh this is Plasma mb
<GOOD> But I did do Erratic
<GOOD> Any run where I can play Flush Fives is a good run
<GOOD> K
<GOOD> Damn it I didn't get a screenshot of my Baron run yesterday
<GOOD> The Needle: No, NO! You're supposed to obey ME!
The 5 polychrome red seal glass king of heart Trib boosted Sock boosted Photochad boosted Steel boosted souls:
<GOOD> Black Deck is the hardest deck, at least for gold stake
<GOOD> I actually hate Plasma the most but ppl dislike Black deck more
<GOOD> Trib best legendary btw WHAT THE FUCK IS AN OBSERVATORY
<GOOD> Perkeocels stay losing
<GOOD> Chips and Mult get balanced after you play your hand, but the ante scales higher
<GOOD> So if you have 500 chips and 1 mult you'd probably have like 250 x 250
<GOOD> Good early game but the xmult pivot is painful sometimes
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> I wish I enjoyed the presents
<GOOD> Maybe I'm just grumpy
<GOOD> They added a new dish tho
<GOOD> Also nobody told me this Final Fantasy 7 was good
<GOOD> I'm trans and undiagnosed but we're pretty sure
<GOOD> I know it was just an observation
<GOOD> I met this guy like 3 hours ago
<GOOD> He's my favourite
<GOOD> I'm not bi
<GOOD> Sephiroth is transition goals tho
<GOOD> I did mod it for QoL stuff BC I'm impatient tho
<GOOD> So maybe I'm cheating or whatever
<GOOD> Game looks great w these mods tho
<GOOD> I modded it to add exp share
<GOOD> So I can use whatever unit
<GOOD> Tifa...
<GOOD> I also made the game look pretty
<GOOD> And idk what else but apparently quite a lot, although it doesn't feel that different I think just QoL shit
<GOOD> I wanna go back to Gold Saucer rn
<GOOD> I haven't played Maneater
<GOOD> Chocobo racing is rigged
<GOOD> They should make the best chocobo win always
<GOOD> All my money, gone
<GOOD> My apes, gone
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Wee joker is the best scaling joker even if it's not mult
<GOOD> I want a big ass real pig like a Mosswine from MH
<GOOD> They kinda have aura but what's with the green
<GOOD> I'm a FNaF fan and if I said this even I'd get laughed off the stage
<GOOD> I'm so craycray
<GOOD> I lowkey might not buy this game
<GOOD> I agree
<GOOD> The battle system looks pretty poorly thought out, like I think you should just control the Pokmon atp
<GOOD> Oooo you will do Yo Kai Watch bug collection oooo
<GOOD> I don't mind the idea of the system
<GOOD> It just feels very basic and it was the highlight of their new stuff so far
<GOOD> Everything else has been megas back!!! Or like, idk rooftop parkour that's just gonna be a movement mechanic
<GOOD> Pokmon with an actual movement system would be crazy
<GOOD> Ok I wasn't paying attention but surely this wasn't the plot right
<GOOD> It was a both sides thing
<GOOD> I love Tattletail but it's 2025
<GOOD> Can I have the flashlight instead
<GOOD> Generational stim toy
<GOOD> If it actually says Tattletail shit or is exactly on model I'll bite
<GOOD> If not I'm out
<GOOD> Nothing pisses me off more than fictional toys being made real and then being inaccurate
<GOOD> It happens with FNaF plushies all the time
<GOOD> I want the LITERAL Tiger Rock plush I don't want a plush OF Tiger Rock
<GOOD> I was clocked out for PLA story tbh
<GOOD> I only remember Volo because it was the only good part
<GOOD> I want this
<GOOD> Yea although I could do without the flesh inside this one
<GOOD> Still not sure what that is about
<GOOD> The HW2 Tiger Rock plush has flesh inside inexplicably
<GOOD> I mean the flesh inside Vanny is probably Vanny
<GOOD> I didn't know that that suit had flesh inside tho
<GOOD> It does because it's all fucked up
<GOOD> Yea but especially here bc it was used for mind control
<GOOD> I can't afford one of those anyway lol
<GOOD> O I didn't know
<GOOD> The Springbonnie one is very tempting but I have already ordered a keychain this week
<GOOD> I can't play Wilds still so I'm pretending I wouldn't enjoy it
<GOOD> I need to keep playing GU tbh that shit is peak
<GOOD> Because it runs like shit and my PC is garbage so that combo means it doesn't run at all
<GOOD> I heard Wilds is very railroady which sucks
<GOOD> And has bad multiplayer again
<GOOD> Yeah but Worlds multiplayer was bad
<GOOD> I wish I bought Rise on Switch but I'm preoccupied rn
<GOOD> It would be more fun if I could play it
<GOOD> O
<GOOD> Hopefully I can play it
<GOOD> Apparently I need the game file tho and my hard drive is getting full asf
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> Sorry for your loss
<GOOD> I'm so jealous
<GOOD> What the FUCK
<GOOD> What is Oops for
<GOOD> Ohhh
<GOOD> Dude I had a crazy run one day where I got Pareidolia, Trading Card and Canio
<GOOD> Hilarious
<GOOD> I want this seed but with Trib
<GOOD> Also  I know you probably know this but Sock doesn't increase glass breaking chance
<GOOD> Ik it's probably bc glass yea
<GOOD> My last Balatro screenshot was this
<GOOD> I won this run tho
<GOOD> I only have 3 gold stakes down tho aaaa
<GOOD> Oh also this
<GOOD> I don't remember what my Balatro record was I think it was a Lucky Cat build
<GOOD> I think this was my final setup for mine
<GOOD> I fucking hate Perkeo tbh
<GOOD> It always pops ante 1 and then never gives you Observatory or any planets
<GOOD> And then you lose because you have to keep it
<GOOD> Yeah but I don't even last like 1 more ante because I get dogshit caeds
<GOOD> Literally never had a Perkeo run get off the ground in the slightest bc of pure chance
<GOOD> Trib is the best joker
<GOOD> Shitty Perkeo accordion vs goated retriggers
<GOOD> I never end up getting anything to duplicate
<GOOD> Chicot is the worst legendary ofc
<GOOD> 15 ish on the app store
<GOOD> And on steam and every console
<GOOD> I think someone put it on DS too
<GOOD> I've never had Chicot save my run tbh
<GOOD> I need this rn
<GOOD> Photochad on the menu again
<GOOD> ok what's the play
<GOOD> Do I sell smiley face for hologram ot no
<GOOD> I assume nah but man I love Hologram
<GOOD> Also like, what arrangement are we thinking because I might put Driver's on the eleft
<GOOD> Left
<GOOD> Wait how do I do both
<GOOD> Nvm I figured it out
<GOOD> Oh dear.
<GOOD> I won
<GOOD> 1 glass king absolutely demolished everything
<GOOD> 11
<GOOD> Read my books
<GOOD> Play UFO 50
<GOOD> I'm playing GU rn
<GOOD> Making a transmog for my main set
<GOOD> Oooh I love that synergy
<GOOD> need advice do I move Blueprint to Sock
<GOOD> I can't do maths
<GOOD> 5 of a kind
<GOOD> I'm Balatro calculatoring rn
<GOOD> Uh
<GOOD> Poik?
<GOOD> It seems like it to me
<GOOD> I think I'm getting a record this run
<GOOD> I didn't get to do it because of Plant
<GOOD> I didn't notice it was coming
<GOOD> Balatro
<GOOD> That pissed me off lowkey I was about to get like e20 or some shit
<GOOD> Although I did run out of glasses and queens
<GOOD> The build only gave me Trib on ante 8 btw, and photochad on like ante 6
<GOOD> Take blueprint
<GOOD> *brainstorm
<GOOD> You can hold it out trust
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> Yeah definitely but may as well sell
<GOOD> You don't need mail in
<GOOD> You have 85 dollars
<GOOD> And satellite
<GOOD> My accommodation front desk gave me sour patch kids and now I keep eating them raaaagh
<GOOD> They're so nice
<GOOD> Whenever I go down there they give me free shit
<GOOD> I still haven't made a Baron run work
<GOOD> I got Obelisk from rare tag earlier on ante fucking 1 and I was mad
<GOOD> I had only played 4 of my most played hand it could never last
<GOOD> I got mad at Splatoon so I started murdering Diablos in MHGU
<GOOD> He's such a good fight
<GOOD> Honestly would start selling shit just to have it continue a little longer
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Oh btw Poik, do you know how to make it so Steam doesn't display what ur playing on Discord
<GOOD> And also on Stewm
<GOOD> Steam
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> I just don't like people peeping
<GOOD> My Library is clean actually
<GOOD> I didn't even get that one game when it was free
<GOOD> I may have slept on it
<GOOD> I don't even know what Invincible is about tbh
<GOOD> It never interested me, same as Tye Boys
<GOOD> It's Boy and the Heron /j
<GOOD> That isn't right but close enough ig
<GOOD> Where do I put the bag socket
<GOOD> Sticker
<GOOD> Subversive super hero story...
<GOOD> I thought JJK had a high budget
<GOOD> I remember the animator on twitter apologising for being awful at animating and being ashamed etc because he couldn't deliver the right ep
<GOOD> Very sad to see
<GOOD> Might play Portal 2 tonight finally
<GOOD> Holy fuck Portal 2 was perfect
<GOOD> One of my new favourite games ever
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Maybe
<GOOD> next gold stake down yahoo
<GOOD> Bus + Trio + Burglar was insane synegy
<GOOD> Like +60, I got it on an early ante but it started scaling too fast bc of Riff Raff
<GOOD> It kept generating mult jokers and I was too scared to sell them
<GOOD> This might also be official
<GOOD> I don't recall
<GOOD> I don't like elf Senshi
<GOOD> I like dwarf Laios tho
<GOOD> Dunmeshi in general is like, perfect to me
<GOOD> Falin is unfortunately not as tall as she seems
<GOOD> Iirc she's like 5'8 or 9
<GOOD> I relate to Laios a lot
<GOOD> And then I found out everyone headcanoned him as autistic
<GOOD> Also Marcille is bi her ideal man is a hot elf guy
<GOOD> I think at least
<GOOD> I'm still undiagnosed but I felt like buying that one stupid hat
<GOOD> Oh also Dunmeshi has like the best villain in animanga imo
<GOOD> Although I like Makima too
<GOOD> Exactly lol, like not even in the bad way
<GOOD> ||I was blindsided tbh but he's a really good sympathetic villain despite being irrevocably an evil being||
<GOOD> ||Plus it makes Thistle really sympathetic and sad||
<GOOD> My ass would have ||fallen for his temptation||
<GOOD> Yeah don't
<GOOD> I will be spoilering all manga content at least
<GOOD> But yea ||I didn't expect Laios to actually be tempted but the characters' flaws are so interesting||
<GOOD> Like it feels like ||real, reasonable manipulation that would work on me in such a situation||
<GOOD> I think Dunmeshi has ||one of the few actually evil villains I still feel bad for due to his perception of morality just being his surroundings and need to survive off desire||
<GOOD> ||Plus his whole consumption without joy thing||
<GOOD> Dunmeshi is like, crazy profound for being a food anime
<GOOD> I mean that too but like, they cook every ep with that whole veil of why does studio Ghibli food look so good ass recipes
<GOOD> But it's disguising something deeper and like, generally exploring why food is important
<GOOD> As an experience instead of as just something to eat to live
<GOOD> ||The Winged Lion eats to survive, but it can't eat to indulge itself and enjoy it||
<GOOD> Yea Dunmeshi is about the idea of consumption and our general place as animals as well as humans too
<GOOD> Yeah it's kinda insane how you can *still* consume it as just a regular fantasy manga after all that too
<GOOD> You don't have to explore any of this and it'll still be good
<GOOD> Yeah that and Frieren have switched me up on fantasy
<GOOD> Although mostly Dunmeshi
<GOOD> Not autistic just obsessed with monsters on a lifetime contract with poor social skills and inability to read a room
<GOOD> What if Laios was obsessed with FNaF instead
<GOOD> Wingtrap
<GOOD> Good because that's me
<GOOD> I even used to have his trim
<GOOD> But now I've grown it out
<GOOD> My hair is kinda shit usually but oh well
<GOOD> This was a while ago tho
<GOOD> I need to make my hair look nice at some point
<GOOD> Idk how tho
<GOOD> I'm also afraid of eventually going bald so yahoo
<GOOD> Because I want to be feminine and I don't mind being grey
<GOOD> I do mind being bald
<GOOD> My hair is arguably the only femme thing about me
<GOOD> I understand that bald can be fem but I would not look fem
<GOOD> I already don't
<GOOD> Scrawling NON BINARY on my forehead in block capitals
<GOOD> just had the best Balatro run ever
<GOOD> I want you to guess what happened from only these 2 images
<GOOD> 2 burglars to scale constellation, I was about to lose on verdant through brute forcing and realised you can sell Burglar

Sell 1 burglar -> judgement I randomly had -> stencil -> sell other Burglar -> win
<GOOD> Actual plot armour
<GOOD> Where's ProJared
<GOOD> Listen to my voice and you'll find the key
<GOOD> I wanna buy normal
<GOOD> But it'll be expensive :((
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> Depends on how far back you want to go
<GOOD> I know Dragonball popularised anime but it took a lot of predecessors
<GOOD> Once you go further back than Dragonball you get like, Astro Boy and Kinnikuman
<GOOD> Kinnikuman inspired basically anyone who's anyone I hear
<GOOD> It had an anime I think
<GOOD> Have you heard of it as Ultimate Muscle maybe?
<GOOD> It's a gag manga/Ultraman spoof turned wrestling shonen
<GOOD> I don't think so
<GOOD> Yeah it's ancient
<GOOD> 1979
<GOOD> Obviously that isn't a huge amount of time before DB, only 7 years, but a lot of mangaka were influenced by it
<GOOD> I was referring to Kinnikuman but yes
<GOOD> Although it and Dr Slump did run next to each other in serialisation
<GOOD> And then Astro Boy is like, the real beginning as far as I know
<GOOD> Began in 1963
<GOOD> Lol
<GOOD> I grew up watching Kinnikuman Legacy
<GOOD> It had a funny 4 kids dub as usual
<GOOD> the dub theme went kinda crazy tho
<GOOD> DB
<GOOD> I need Delicious in Dungeon season 2
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I recommend everyone that anime
<GOOD> It's like the only one I safely recommend to people except Frieren maybe
<GOOD> Because I'm not just gonna recommend CSM or Dandadan to random people
<GOOD> You'll have to wait a long time
<GOOD> The manga isn't even close to ending yet
<GOOD> Mega Demondrugs ew
<GOOD> There's no way this is real right
<GOOD> In LA, where the Dan Hentschel series at? DJ want Max Max!!!
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Is he still in jail
<GOOD> Oh it's the Abby account
<GOOD> Or whatever he called his fake wife
<GOOD> Goes crazy I like the fit
<GOOD> Mmmm I'm not an eel person
<GOOD> As in like knowledge
<GOOD> I love eels
<GOOD> Ooooo
<GOOD> Sorry I'm like, stressing over work stuff rn
<GOOD> I'm worried about my data being wrong or improperly presented
<GOOD> Also I made a new guy through doodles but I don't wanna draw him properly bc I'm busy aaa
<GOOD> character design is easy promise
<GOOD> (I doodled this in class so it looks like shit)
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> They're both based on the same species and I didn't wanna humanise this OC in particular so
<GOOD> Like it's meant to be a human*oid* because it's an experimental middleman on the way to revive human beings through synthetic animals
<GOOD> But it's a middleman so it's a little fucked up
<GOOD> Might put clothes on him but it's a bit of a Winnie the Pooh thing
<GOOD> Yea I was meaning to make his legs stubby but I was drawing in pen
<GOOD> I was also drawing the scrap metal Mantis Shrimp mech idea
<GOOD> Very bad looking but it conveys an idea so
<GOOD> That was an image bc my bestie said he would eat a TV and the screen would be in his mouth
<GOOD> But yea they're part of an amphibian + reptile team with a frog, a toad, a sea snake and an alligator
<GOOD> The other teams are:
 2 elasmobranchs + a misplaced Man o War
3 gastropods
4 crustaceans
Then this one and the rest are a WIP
<GOOD> The next one we're probably doing is gonna be generic predators like piranhas, barracudas and great white sharks
<GOOD> My friend is thinking about making one
<GOOD> I'd probably just give them makeup similar to triggerfish markings
<GOOD> They were cooking
<GOOD> Poik play Nubby's Number Factory trust
<GOOD> Steam only I think
<GOOD> I'm playing it tomorrow
<GOOD> Oh Marcel did I send you the drawings of the guy I showed you earlier btw
<GOOD> He's been digitised mildly
<GOOD> I got bored
<GOOD> Gen chat tuah
<GOOD> Throwback is not the best joker imo
<GOOD> It's only quite good but not among the best
<GOOD> Apart from Brainstorm or including it
<GOOD> *Blueprint
<GOOD> Kinda boring but in that case it's Blueprint, Brainstorm, Trib lmao
<GOOD> Triboulet
<GOOD> Stuntman is also up there
<GOOD> Then Stuntman
<GOOD> Ride the Bus
<GOOD> Mmm a lot more options too
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Then don't play a face card
<GOOD> And Stuntman doesn't need hand size
<GOOD> the Obelisk pill is real
<GOOD> I sold Trib for Brainstorm to keep the Obelisk running
<GOOD> I wasn't playing anything with enough base mult to make it remarkable
<GOOD> Spare trousers was where all my mult was coming from
<GOOD> I unlocked gold stake green deck anyway so that's what's next on the list
<GOOD> I'm struggling so bad with report writing raaagh
<GOOD> Why would I do that
<GOOD> Yippee
<GOOD> Gold stake down
<GOOD> Same chat just public
<GOOD> I love gambling
<GOOD> I'm losing it
<GOOD> oh my god
<GOOD> First straight build to ever work
<GOOD> Also 7th gold stake down I think
<GOOD> I was steering so badly in the middle
<GOOD> I had literally no mult apart from ripped joker so I was just relying on planets and Runner
<GOOD> Literally
<GOOD> Driver's License wasn't online yet
<GOOD> I literally won two blinds in a row to get me over the line just by activating Luckies
<GOOD> At least now I don't have to use this shitty deck
<GOOD> MH4U MIGHT be peak
<GOOD> Isn't that how that philosopher died
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> This game kinda easy actually
<GOOD> 4oak, 5 when available
<GOOD> I just got a shitload of kings to start out
<GOOD> That's nice
<GOOD> Rain World is so good
<GOOD> I have 30 hours on my first playthrough but I started Downpour campaigns yesterday and I have like 3(?) on Gourmand now
<GOOD> It's going a lot better bc now I have game knowledge sorta
<GOOD> Been killing a ton of lizards then feasting on them
<GOOD> Shaded Citadel sucks I don't blame you
<GOOD> It took me a lot of tedious crawling to get through it
<GOOD> I'm rlly bad at learning languages
<GOOD> Didn't rlly have an interest unfortunately
<GOOD> YAY NEW CHAINSAW MAN
<GOOD> Evil cat
<GOOD> RAAAA SECOND RAIN WORLD CAMPAIGN DOWN
<GOOD> I thought it was just called Crab tbh
<GOOD> Anyway what are y'all maining
<GOOD> My friends are currently lining up as Pokey and Penguin and I'm going Pianta
<GOOD> Duskblood is multiplayer focused?
<GOOD> Wtf
<GOOD> That's a very funny name
<GOOD> Chat rate my map
<GOOD> It's so cool
<GOOD> Giving this to a first time Rain World player and making them navigate with just this
<GOOD> The entire rain world map from my shit memory
<GOOD> There is a lot missing
<GOOD> I'm playing through its first DLC rn and it's fantastic
<GOOD> I am playing as Rivulet rn
<GOOD> No wtf
<GOOD> Yerp
<GOOD> Also I was half asleep but these are cool as hell
<GOOD> These are hilarious
<GOOD> FNaF 1 especially
<GOOD> I'm glad they included creepy castle tho
<GOOD> Even I forget about that sometimes
<GOOD> One of the only games to ever get a FNaF Collab
<GOOD> As sloppy as FNaF is with merch, for some reason Scott has a very short leash on crossovers
<GOOD> I think I'm missing something with why people are calling Duskbloods multiplayer only
<GOOD> That's what I'm saying
<GOOD> We saw multiplayer but idk why people are saying it's only multiplayer
<GOOD> Tbf you can't really do FNaF 3 without the man himself
<GOOD> FNaF 6 doesn't really have a mascot although I am partial to lefty
<GOOD> And Rockstars are in the game's main screen so
<GOOD> THE MIMI
<GOOD> I recently came across a channel with like 7 supercuts on different Rain World campaigns and now I'm mining through that
<GOOD> I just saw a FNaF 4 ransomware post thing and they had the shitty chain link fence on the bed
<GOOD> I need this trend to be over
<GOOD> Which one
<GOOD> The joke one Fusion played?
<GOOD> I've seen the FNaF 2 remake
<GOOD> If it's the ransomware one
<GOOD> Yay
<GOOD> I saw
<GOOD> We love parkour Civilization
<GOOD> Finally made OC progress
<GOOD> Hoooly shit
<GOOD> Goat mentioned
<GOOD> Good afternoon
<GOOD> Juice
<GOOD> Very cool
<GOOD> I got mad at my drawings and quit
<GOOD> Idk what to draw now tho
<GOOD> I wanna watch Chainsaw Man later too
<GOOD> This seems expected
<GOOD> Everything is gonna have its price adjusted
<GOOD> I need more Parappa
<GOOD> Bring me Parappa
<GOOD> Erm... This is my Pokmon fic where Chairman Rose wants to harness transgener energy and awakens Wokernatus... Fully serious..
<GOOD> Are people only now being introduced to shitty troll fanfics
<GOOD> This one sounds pretty mid
<GOOD> But in general I agree
<GOOD> I remember that one
<GOOD> That's like, the titular shitty fic
<GOOD> Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese
<GOOD> It's a reference to a Parappa video
<GOOD> Mildly funny, but not my colour of humour
<GOOD> Ppl thinking that I'm scared of creepypastas because I'm a creepypasta fan
<GOOD> Also the amount of people thinking that the Xtratuna type songs aren't satire and they're like THIS is what modern FNaF has led to....
<GOOD> (mild tangent about Phisnom)
<GOOD> How can I make this about FNaF+
<GOOD> As far as I know he quit of his own volition
<GOOD> But he still keeps talking about FNaF
<GOOD> He watched the Mimic song and turned it into some sort of reflection of modern FNaF and the community
<GOOD> He's such a tool
<GOOD> I don't love the fandom more than the games
<GOOD> I would think that to be impossible
<GOOD> That is not what ransomware means and kinitopet is not ransomware
<GOOD> Ransomware is just something that simulates ransomware to be scarier
<GOOD> So a shitty knockoff movies free game
<GOOD> His avatar looks like pre timeskip Max G I saw his ass getting kicked out of the fanverse from a mile away
<GOOD> Ofc he took it seriously
<GOOD> Hazbin Hotel ass teeth is a red flag for your sonas
<GOOD> Phisnom didn't die
<GOOD> If he died I would probably be more sympathetic
<GOOD> Anyway the FNaF fandom is a cesspit in general unfortunately
<GOOD> There has never been a period in which I'd call the fandom even slightly fine
<GOOD> Goat mentioned
<GOOD> That shit isn't the issue lol
<GOOD> Someone in the fandom gets allegations every other week
<GOOD> And half of the fandom is inclined towards killing Scott Cawthon if something bad happens
<GOOD> You sound disgusting
<GOOD> Final destination is funny
<GOOD> They sent death threats to the Talbert Files guy too
<GOOD> Fake FNaF book leak that was spread as real by a prominent member of the community
<GOOD> Actually the death threats were what got the ball rolling on it being cancelled, as the person was accused of his audience sending them
<GOOD> He was accused of his community members sending gore to some random kid
<GOOD> And then he took it too lightly and got his ass beat because he sucks
<GOOD> And then when it came out that they weren't related to him, he pivoted and said it was never his fault
<GOOD> So that dumbass deserved to get ousted
<GOOD> Watch this space, I don't wish bad things upon people but Kane Carter might be next lmfaoooo
<GOOD> Kane is like 2 bad incidents away from the Fanverse going down to like 2 members
<GOOD> Ass
<GOOD> Everything that I could say about it has already been said
<GOOD> It's disappointing though
<GOOD> Tjoc, Popgoes and FNaC are the current Fanverse lineup
<GOOD> I feel like I missed someone but I don't think so
<GOOD> I hope it actually has good gameplay for the first time
<GOOD> Also genuinely how the fuck hasn't even one fanverse flagship game been released tet
<GOOD> I don't crunch devs but the only one released has been Flumpty's
<GOOD> And Flumpty's was removed from the Fanverse a week later
<GOOD> The announcement is 5 years old this year btw
<GOOD> One is cancelled, one was released then cancelled, one might actually release this year if Kane Carter doesn't fuck up, one has basically no content and one is on indefinite hiatus (hopefully Nikson takes care)
<GOOD> To be honest MyPopgoes and Popgoes Arcade were neat but why did they release before the flagship game
<GOOD> I want Evergreen Kane
<GOOD> Is this really the server to talk about it
<GOOD> Research
<GOOD> Begging the guy that's said slurs a bunch and said in my head I'm always saying slurs. Always. To release a game before he gets torn to shreds by the FNaF community the next time he fucks up
<GOOD> Oh Switch 2 is staying the same price in the US
<GOOD> Neato
<GOOD> I saw videos of decapitation when I was like 13
<GOOD> Socials aren't for young kids
<GOOD> Why are you conflating social media moderation and child abuse
<GOOD> Well everybody else is so I'd recommend getting on our page instead of accusing ppl of backing child abuse
<GOOD> Idk what bizarro messages you're reading
<GOOD> I hate the new guy a little more
<GOOD> Elon Musk if you're talking about Twitter owners
<GOOD> Oh ok then fuck that guy
<GOOD> I meant moderation as in control your children so they don't get pulled into some horrific internet shit pit
<GOOD> control your children not referring to literal manipulation, but encouraging something that isn't seeing people get shot online at age 10
<GOOD> Depends on what the thing is, lecturing your child on not going on 4chan or some shit or the dogshit yt shorts pipeline is advised
<GOOD> Sometimes you do in fact have to stop your children from doing things that are harmful to them
<GOOD> Isn't it gone for a few days
<GOOD> Also 4chan is not safe
<GOOD> Some things on the internet are things that you truly will never need to see in your entire life
<GOOD> Or at least hopefully
<GOOD> I think you missed mine somehow
<GOOD> Counterculture + self destructive behaviour is generally ill-advised or illegal
<GOOD> Tbh I've seen many things I wish I'd never seen
<GOOD> Way too many things
<GOOD> I can recall some  images in my mind better than I can recall things that actually happened to me
<GOOD> I feel like it fucked me up at least a little
<GOOD> I'm the experiment
<GOOD> Slippery slope fallacy imo
<GOOD> Someone has played fallacy quiz on Steam /silly
<GOOD> I think we need a national ID thing for this reason tbh
<GOOD> Like just an easily accessible digital ID
<GOOD> Not everyone has their birth certificate
<GOOD> I'm talking about a universal ID
<GOOD> I don't think you know what I mean
<GOOD> Like I'm talking about literally just a governmentally backed way to have identification for people
<GOOD> The damage of the internet is an immeasurable metric
<GOOD> I love the Mimic tbh
<GOOD> Not even Shadow, I disapprove
<GOOD> God Makima I hate you
<GOOD> Bc she sucks and she's an awesome villain
<GOOD> I'm ProJared and I cheated on my wife
<GOOD> Holy SHIT Gaslight District pilot went crazy
<GOOD> The crab:
<GOOD> This reminds me of when one of my favourite streamers went on a tangent about Fallout 3's ending
<GOOD> Yeah that was what the rant was about because the game treats you like a bitch for not killing yourself in an irradiated room
<GOOD> Which I do find very funny
<GOOD> I'm stuck on my essay rn
<GOOD> I have 500 words left but can't write them until next week when I get help with my code
<GOOD> Yeah I had one of those last year
<GOOD> ~50 references for 3300 words
<GOOD> I actually do only write 50-100 words at a time but that's because I like being chill and starting work super early
<GOOD> I had to cite an early 1800s paper in a different language for my last essay
<GOOD> I hope they don't
<GOOD> De-extinction is still currently pretty hack-y, and imo is a Pandora's Box we shouldn't open
<GOOD> There isn't much merit to bringing many species back
<GOOD> And I say this as someone interested in conservation
<GOOD> The mammoth thing annoyed me a lot
<GOOD> Sounds pretty right, it's not my main issue but it's true
<GOOD> My main issue is how short sighted people are to believe that this helps the animals at all
<GOOD> Especially with the mammoth
<GOOD> And the wooly mice or whatever the fuck
<GOOD> I have a bit of a belief that ppl have an inclination to believe that scientists literally always have the best and most humanitarian interests in mind, at least when compared to a layman when that just isn't the case
<GOOD> Like just because someone says mammoths could slow ice melting in the Arctic, I don't have to believe that you're genetically modifying mice to test that hypothesis
<GOOD> Scientists can be immoral too
<GOOD> Norm of the North
<GOOD> My mom recommended DMC to me and I had to say yeah haha maybe instead of I'm good thanks
<GOOD> Yeah the anime
<GOOD> She didn't watch it
<GOOD> But she is cool
<GOOD> I don't want to watch it because it has Asmongold
<GOOD> And the show's creator glazed him and used him in a shallow racism allegory
<GOOD> The showrunner
<GOOD> They made him a conspiracy theorist that was right about everything
<GOOD> At least that's what I've heard
<GOOD> Literal demons in the show but it's written as people that are a different race to you
<GOOD> Yeah it was apparently very heavily paralleled to the US invading countries (again have not watched it tho)
<GOOD> Frieren handles demons the best because they're literally just the main predator to humans
<GOOD> Which imo is a cool dynamic for a pure evil species
<GOOD> Gaslight District pilot was so good
<GOOD> I really liked it
<GOOD> I thought that I wasn't gonna like it but it was gorgeous
<GOOD> A little bit too frantic camera work for me at times but that's it
<GOOD> It's so expressive and clean
<GOOD> I need episode 2 raaa
<GOOD> I'm the rare MGS fan that got into RR through the MGS trilogy
<GOOD> TRUE
<GOOD> They should bring back Gear Rex
<GOOD> I haven't played 4
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Gaslight District was awesome
<GOOD> Which game
<GOOD> Idk if Arzuros appears after GU
<GOOD> Oh I haven't played that
<GOOD> Almost got my ass beat by Deviant Arzuros in GU tho
<GOOD> Redmane Arzuros I think
<GOOD> *Redhelm
<GOOD> This deviant goes crazy tho
<GOOD> Oh yeah I watched that ep
<GOOD> Also I was under the impression that Dixie and Diddy are both adults, is this not the case in the show
<GOOD> I know I was just under the impression that Dixie was an adult BC she's the older sister of Tiny Kong
<GOOD> Yeah she aged like a lot
<GOOD> Pikmin 1 is more painful for this
<GOOD> Is that Son Goku
<GOOD> Things WE would do if we were the Mimic:
Rip the heads off Fazbear employees
Be evil and kill children
Get buried under the Mega Pizzaplex
Attempt to kill Cassie
<GOOD> Didn't he kill some random teens that broke in
<GOOD> Or something like that
<GOOD> Spider verse
<GOOD> Are we at the point I can say the whole thing with that was kinda annoying btw
<GOOD> The movie was amazing tho
<GOOD> I don't think so
<GOOD> I'm not certain tho
<GOOD> did you think this was Fredbear's mouth in his sprite
<GOOD> I literally found out it wasn't today
<GOOD> Yeah I saw this post earlier And I'm definitely in the left side
<GOOD> I thought it was just an open frowning mouth
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> Yeah I'm broke I couldn't have all that lol
<GOOD> I have a foxy backpack and some other small things, that's about it actually
<GOOD> Very strange looking Nightmare Freddy as usual
<GOOD> Why would you feel the need to say that
<GOOD> It was rhetorical I don't want you to say that
<GOOD> CalArts villain
<GOOD> They were running away from what was either shadows consuming everything or dust bunnies
<GOOD> I assume chapter 3 is the mobster/music one
<GOOD> Well yea if 3 is TV themed it will be a lot of pop culture stuff I presume
<GOOD> Movies etc
<GOOD> 4 we just don't know yet
<GOOD> Practicing doodles is hard
<GOOD> Gojo being alive is incredibly out of character
<GOOD> Gojo vs Black Chainsaw Man would be interesting to me
<GOOD> But I don't know shit about JJK so
<GOOD> I don't like powerscaling but I especially don't like scaling characters like Gojo
<GOOD> Because characters that can break through his hax are immediately able to turn him into red paste in most circumstances
<GOOD> I'm somewhat of a center position on it because if a story just has no basis of logic for strength it becomes boring or unimpactful
<GOOD> I think in most situations powerscaling doesn't matter, but honestly Dragonball's actual in universe handling of power is kinda boring at times
<GOOD> ~~Except for Gohan~~
<GOOD> I'm also more referring to the scale at which things occur
<GOOD> Like, DB jumped the shark so fast
<GOOD> Even then I'm always just like Nappa could probably destroy a planet in less than a minute if he tried
<GOOD> And then Frieza is like a million times stronger than Nappa
<GOOD> I've read it
<GOOD> But I'm saying DB's scale isn't represented well by what happens in it
<GOOD> Which isn't an issue in most other manga
<GOOD> Depends on how good the author handles it too
<GOOD> Also I have been sent this thumbnail and I think someone has taste
<GOOD> Goaturabachi mentioned
<GOOD> I need to fill out this later
<GOOD> I'm struggling to fill this out rn
<GOOD> Chat help me
<GOOD> This is so difficult
<GOOD> Nothing is going towards date because all my favourite characters are scrimblos
<GOOD> If you'll consult the graph, she's at the midpoint between dating and wanting to be them
<GOOD> It's better than nothing
<GOOD> She's nowhere near the want to be them placement so I half agree
<GOOD> Both I already thought about this
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Honestly I might put her closer to the top but not higher than GlaDoS
<GOOD> But I literally cannot think of any characters I would date
<GOOD> Manifesting the hottest character I know
<GOOD> That would make a square
<GOOD> That's somewhat surprising to me
<GOOD> I would assume you knew who Mangle is
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Brb checking the Arms roster for a cute character
<GOOD> Nowhere
<GOOD> I don't like DIO, if I were DIO I would shoot myself, and I would rather die than date him
<GOOD> He's Makima but infinitely more sadistic and brutal
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Oh right Purah exists
<GOOD> Jeff the Killer
<GOOD> She's so annoying sometimes but also funny so she's forgiven
<GOOD> Yeah some jesters are going in, issue is none of them are in the dating category lmfao
<GOOD> I cannot finish this graph bro
<GOOD> Also Scrafty might be climbing my favourite Pokmon rankings
<GOOD> I can't wait for Switch 2
<GOOD> Have I considered spending considerably more to give Nvidia thousands of dollars?
<GOOD> No, it didn't occur to me
<GOOD> Finally, a console for people who love men
<GOOD> My graph is going poorly
<GOOD> Let me break it down for you Mark
<GOOD> I finally found another character for the fuckass graph
<GOOD> Send me N's Sigilyph when you pull it
<GOOD> Ok this shit is finally coming along nicely
<GOOD> It's taking forever
<GOOD> Categorising things on a gradient instead of an order or in blocks is infuriating
<GOOD> 50 houses maybe I should just die
<GOOD> NEED NEED NEED
<GOOD> Dawko even said he was removing the horrible fabric texture I'm so excited
<GOOD> There's a Jackie and Yellow Rabbit plush too
<GOOD> And some clothing
<GOOD> It comes with the hoax purple guy head and it's interchangeable
<GOOD> For your perusal (there's also Sun and Moon plushies with battery powered light up eyes)
<GOOD> I wish Hex wasn't so expensive I'd buy the Mimic
<GOOD> I need to damage my character and idk how
<GOOD> I might just like, grab a mannequin image so I can see where injuries would go
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> She's about to get mauled by a villain
<GOOD> So I need to think of physical outcome
<GOOD> She's only wearing padded leather
<GOOD> And it is not gonna help her that much
<GOOD> She's gonna get burned by jets yea
<GOOD> The character attacking her is basically just a bird person that's spiky and propels itself with jets
<GOOD> No she's just taking that damage
<GOOD> Like she isn't blocking it, she's getting stabbed in the back, draped across the character's wings and then slashed by talons etc
<GOOD> She's an assassin she isn't made for defense
<GOOD> I don't think the armour will work in this case, I need a design change
<GOOD> Depending on how bad it is she might even lose an appendage
<GOOD> I didn't ever feel the allure of older elder scrolls games
<GOOD> Skyrim was ok tho
<GOOD> Same with Fallout tbh
<GOOD> I liked Fallout 4 a lot
<GOOD> Didn't rlly get hyped about any Fallout before or after 4
<GOOD> Skyrim is probably getting another port onto Switch 2 right
<GOOD> I am embarrassed to say the only game I bought on release for ~90 dollars
<GOOD> I got my money's worth tho
<GOOD> Unironically but I'm never doing it ever again
<GOOD> The game was Jump Force
<GOOD> I did it was great
<GOOD> I should have specified game
<GOOD> I've been busy watching Chainsaw Man again
<GOOD> That's why I haven't continued AF
<GOOD> I might watch it later I need to take my mind off work
<GOOD> Rn I'm just filling out this one template
<GOOD> Because I'm bored
<GOOD> If it's the game is bad then yes I know
<GOOD> But it was my guilty pleasure and I played it so much that I got my money's worth
<GOOD> I don't need Persona 5 Royal I have Jump Force
<GOOD> I want to but can't run it on PC
<GOOD> I'd be playing tf out of it if I could
<GOOD> I miss playing LeBron
<GOOD> Honestly yes but I prefer Mario 3 on 3 Hoops DS
<GOOD> I was a nasty black mage main as a kid
<GOOD> I need to play DS Hoops again
<GOOD> Or Mario Sports Mix
<GOOD> Switch Tuah
<GOOD> I hope they make good Mario Sports games this time
<GOOD> I played Mario Tennis on Switch and it was awful
<GOOD> And then I played Golf and it was mid but not awful
<GOOD> Strikers was bad, I played it on Wii and it was better
<GOOD> Although still not my thing I think
<GOOD> Yes why
<GOOD> I need to play Ace Attorney again soon
<GOOD> I wanna continue Investigations 1
<GOOD> And then Apollo Justice and the 3D games
<GOOD> There's so much Ace Attorney
<GOOD> I'm biased so I'm not a good source
<GOOD> I heard people like Legends Arceus but I didn't
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I don't think Tennis is for me, except when I played it on Wii as a kid
<GOOD> That one painting minigame went hard
<GOOD> Where you hit paintballs at a wall
<GOOD> Yes, I agree we should bring back the 3DS sports game era thank you Dipper
<GOOD> I like the Wii and GC ones
<GOOD> Or the Wii ports of the GC ones
<GOOD> Or Samba De Amigo
<GOOD> I don't like a lot of Mario sports tbh
<GOOD> I liked the Wii ones as a kid a ton
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Dipper what are your thoughts on non Mario kart racers
<GOOD> It came up because of Sonic, I had a conversation the other day where I said I wasn't enamoured with any non-Mario Kart racers because it feels like I'm not playing Mario Kart
<GOOD> This could apply to any kart racer tho
<GOOD> Chocobo GP, Sonic and Sega, Garfield Kart etc
<GOOD> Mostly due to how they control more than anything else
<GOOD> I tried it it wasn't fun to me
<GOOD> Idk I just raced some guys
<GOOD> It didn't control very well
<GOOD> Or at least as much as usual
<GOOD> That's kinda what I mean when I'm like it doesn't control like Mario Kart and usually that means it's worse
<GOOD> Except F Zero but that's not a kart racer
<GOOD> Maybe I just wanna play Ace Attorney rn tho
<GOOD> I wanna press the Logic button
<GOOD> Also I am thinking of this render rn
<GOOD> Actually wait idk whether to play Investigations or Great Ace Attorney
<GOOD> I need to do the second case in both
<GOOD> I also wanna play more Arms
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I haven't played online yet because I'm afraid of the sweats
<GOOD> That's it I'm picking Dr Coyle
<GOOD> And no I'm busy filling out my chart
<GOOD> Mineru and Shadow and 3 and Falin and the Watcher aren't evil
<GOOD> Or Rika
<GOOD> V1 isn't evil to me but that's debatable
<GOOD> Same as Mangle
<GOOD> You lie
<GOOD> Not about the girls part
<GOOD> But yes I need to add more
<GOOD> He fits in none of the 3
<GOOD> Perhaps
<GOOD> I wanna put a monster hunter monster in there but idk which
<GOOD> I think I'd like to be Valstrax
<GOOD> Idk other characters to put on here
<GOOD> This compression is insane
<GOOD> Not as much effort put into its optimisation I imagine
<GOOD> Compression
<GOOD> Because the games are small
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I haven't played more than a few hours of Persona 5 is this in reference to those three getting their outfits
<GOOD> Anne's made me deeply uncomfortable
<GOOD> Anyway my graph is still unpopulated
<GOOD> I haven't been able to add many because I'm stalling out on ideas
<GOOD> Good
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> That's Justice Guilty Gear
<GOOD> She's Sol's ex wife as far as I know
<GOOD> I thought she was dead
<GOOD> Like she became Justice then died
<GOOD> Anyway Justice is kinda bad and also awesome so I'm putting her between wanting to be her and dating her
<GOOD> Remembering that one Cynessa dating POV art where she serves you human flesh tbh
<GOOD> Chat what's that one anime with the blonde guy with a big red coat
<GOOD> Hi chat I'm injuring my OC rn
<GOOD> They're going in the torture room
<GOOD> Lying ass streamer
<GOOD> Ok yeah I know all of these games in the video
<GOOD> I remember playing them when they released
<GOOD> Dude why is Scrafty so cool
<GOOD> I wanna play that Pokmon Close Combat game ngl
<GOOD> This roster so cool
<GOOD> I would main the fuck out of Heracross and Scrafty
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> If you ever get access we should
<GOOD> I'm too scared to play against anyone that knows fighting games
<GOOD> I'm more scared of Strive guys
<GOOD> I played some Strive but I'm not commital enough to learn fighting games for real
<GOOD> I watched a video essay about this
<GOOD> I loved Gaslight District
<GOOD> Hi char
<GOOD> I think I literally posted a Pokmon character I had a crush on here yesterday as part of that graph I'm doing
<GOOD> Rika
<GOOD> I love doodling my OCs on Whiteboard
<GOOD> I love damaging my OC
<GOOD> (I actually don't but it makes for cool character design)
<GOOD> I removed 2 of my OC's limbs, they're good to go
<GOOD> Plus they're slaying as ysual
<GOOD> It says prosthetic
<GOOD> This fandom is a fucking prison
<GOOD> How detailed is underdetailed
<GOOD> Which in this case is
<GOOD> Nah Paldea mons are some of the best
<GOOD> Then I'm going to sleep instead
<GOOD> I drew my friend's OC, why did I make her look like
<GOOD> She doesn't look like this
<GOOD> Same it's hell
<GOOD> R coding
<GOOD> I have to analyse this dataset but it's organised like absolute dogshit
<GOOD> Basically the dataset is organised by mean species abundance per sample, when I either needed:
Raw species abundance per sample
Or
Mean biodiversity per transect
<GOOD> Can't unfortunately, the data is organised so the individual species are along the y-axis and isn't labelled as species
<GOOD> If I could categorise them all under species then I'd be able to manipulate the data but I can't
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> Can it be the other shitty old people instead
<GOOD> It was a bit of a bad day to die
<GOOD> Although ig Easter Monday is the day after, so it's the furthest away from Easter Sunday it could possibly be
<GOOD> Maybe he chose the best day for it
<GOOD> The rage boiling up inside me as I see DK fly up the screen on that fuckass red balloon
<GOOD> The sheer anger that goes through my veins when a minecart level
<GOOD> I think I literally messed up because of the phrasing of the questions
<GOOD> The questions were either poorly phrased or somewhat vague
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Idk I parsed a lot of it as very easy and binary answers, but then some were less clear
<GOOD> No vro I'm campaigning here gtfo
<GOOD> I'm campaigning for Super Pope
<GOOD> All cardinals in chat vote for me
<GOOD> I'm gonna be the Pope
<GOOD> I will use my Pope powers for good
<GOOD> Oh I'm somewhat sad that he's gone
<GOOD> I'm not like, devastated but it's sad
<GOOD> Still gonna make jokes about the job of Pope tho
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I'm 20 in 2 months I feel old
<GOOD> Keyboard, I wrote old
<GOOD> Why did it make me key
<GOOD> He said trans people can be baptised, lectured an evil person then died the day after
<GOOD> My hungry ass getting out of bed because McDonald's gave me an offer for cheap chicken
<GOOD> Chat do y'all fw my whale
<GOOD> GER was poor writing
<GOOD> They added the arrow last minute
<GOOD> Araki simply can't stick the endings on half of his Parts
<GOOD> Parts 4 and 6 are the good ones
<GOOD> 7 also has a goated ending
<GOOD> Because its broken powerup was actually thought about in advance
<GOOD> I mean the stand is also pretty lame
<GOOD> GER just isn't an interesting ending
<GOOD> Not rlly a fan of random power up introductions
<GOOD> If it wasn't possible then don't write it that way lmao
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Also ngl Giorno's damage reflect thing and access to toxins could have beaten Diavolo
<GOOD> Poison is slow acting so it would act outside of the scope of Epitaph
<GOOD> Bites the Dust wasn't requiem tho
<GOOD> Araki is the GOAT when it comes to doing things like one time ever then never talking about it again
<GOOD> But yea JoJo is very much a poorly thought through series at times, I don't care how many Harmon Beat videos you send me
<GOOD> I'm ngl I fully believe the gang could have beaten Diavolo without the arrow in the situation they were in
<GOOD> Also WANNABE is the worst stand cry
<GOOD> 3 of them died anyway
<GOOD> I think idk
<GOOD> This is the end of a JoJo part kill as many as you need
<GOOD> It's not like the part 5 guys were coming back anyway
<GOOD> Also as much as I like Fugo leaving, I think Araki made a poor choice in leaving behind the only fucking guy that had a definitive counter to Diavolo
<GOOD> I don't really care about the context outside of the story in this case
<GOOD> I'm aware it does, and it's unfortunate that he was in a bad place
<GOOD> I don't care if Fugo was or wasn't written out, I care because it led to GER which sucked
<GOOD> Too sudden for me
<GOOD> Oh there's this mcguffin go to the colosseum oh the mcguffin is an arrow oh the arrow gave you an instant win transformation ok cool part ends
<GOOD> Bloons?
<GOOD> Oh bites the dust
<GOOD> Bites the Dust was fine imo
<GOOD> It took up enough time
<GOOD> The entirety of part 4 was about the arrows
<GOOD> So I think that part 4 having an arrow lore thing was interesting
<GOOD> The entire middle point of the part was about following the trail of arrows and who caused shit like Okuyasu's dad
<GOOD> Everything that isn't alive goes fast
<GOOD> And the user can go fast if he wants
<GOOD> Then some other stuff but that's the basics
<GOOD> I'm trying to oversimplify but yea
<GOOD> Cactus King mogged
<GOOD> Can I say I don't like Paisley Park that much
<GOOD> 6 was awesome and 7 is super super good
<GOOD> Also it's all the same universe that was the point
<GOOD> Super super good > awesome
<GOOD> Bc I like both
<GOOD> I really don't care tbh I clarified that I think Part 7 is better and Part 6 is good
<GOOD> Hard agree but tbh I didn't even mind the anime
<GOOD> Dio matters in literally every part up to 6 inarguably, and 7 and 8 and 9 are a product of his influence
<GOOD> I'm not gonna say Diego matters a huge amount in the broader scope of the series but still
<GOOD> Being the direct cause of things makes you plot relevant
<GOOD> Dio literally gave birth to Giorno yeah
<GOOD> You said he wasn't plot relevant
<GOOD> Stand
<GOOD> But he is main plot relevant
<GOOD> He causes the main plot of basically every part
<GOOD> It's like saying Manfred von Karma has no effect on any Ace Attorney game after 1
<GOOD> That isn't really comparable because they didn't say his bloodline had no effect
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> I'm saying that Dio isn't plot relevant is like saying von Karma isn't
<GOOD> I like when D4C's skull breaks and it looks like machinery like that one fucking episode of SpongeBob where he makes Gary explode
<GOOD> I wish Johnny had his green fit
<GOOD> I like green Johnny
<GOOD> Also is Gyro missing something on his shirt
<GOOD> It looks like there's dead space on it
<GOOD> My brother just sent me an image that reads the rooster experiments on the homeless
<GOOD> The rooster experiments on the homeless
<GOOD> I hate this fucking fandom
<GOOD> People are stupid
<GOOD> Idrc about that Roxy is on my graph
<GOOD> I need to complete this actually
<GOOD> I sort of understand that, it was simply the climate at the time to like Springtrap for some reason tho (the rest are weird)
<GOOD> Ppl loved Vincent
<GOOD> Yes, Queen
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> At least in Security Breach
<GOOD> That's not how that ability works
<GOOD> Schrdinger's cat is not immortal cats
<GOOD> Trying not to turn my OC into Quanxi from CSM
<GOOD> Rain World
<GOOD> Raaagh I wanna watch more Chainsaw Man
<GOOD> I love the cast
<GOOD> I've already read it and watched it but I wanna watch it again
<GOOD> Thinking about that one FNaF video where the bald guy goes hi, I'm Freddy Fazbear
<GOOD> I wanna draw
<GOOD> Carbs are usually important
<GOOD> Nostalgia
<GOOD> Seen it, loved it, drew it and compared it to my OCs
<GOOD> I was forced to read Animal Farm it was kind of a banger
<GOOD> I also read Noughts and Crosses and Of Mice and Men which were mid
<GOOD> I read Holes but didn't absorb it
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> We did a few Shakespeare plays
<GOOD> Taming of the Shrew and Much Ado about Nothing
<GOOD> Taming of the Shrew was ass, Much Ado was ok but still kinda ass
<GOOD> Both were about placating rebellious women it was kind of uncomfortable even when I was less sensitive about that stuff BC I was 14
<GOOD> 1984 was kinda boring
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is so awesome
<GOOD> San undertale
<GOOD> Has anyone ever encountered a papyrus voice that isn't Skeletor
<GOOD> Summoning Satan rn
<GOOD> Actually I won't do it today Pope dead
<GOOD> You've said antifa like 3 times in this conversation about football
<GOOD> That feels somewhat extra
<GOOD> I would Google it
<GOOD> I'm horror Sans
<GOOD> My dad supports my local team and I don't give a shit because football fans tend to be annoying
<GOOD> I've also heard a few random stories of my dad getting bricks chucked at him and people pulling screwdrivers out of a newspaper to stab his friend
<GOOD> So yk, not all that great
<GOOD> Drawing shitty Undertale AU forms of my OC rn actually
<GOOD> Complete with Horror Sans
<GOOD> I will later
<GOOD> I'm so sleepy
<GOOD> My friend finally drew our entire team of OCs raaagh
<GOOD> We're all done
<GOOD> I need to make a Pokmon OC at some point
<GOOD> I drew my fucked up whale yesterday (not very well)
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> My friend drew the entire crew and she fucking cooked
<GOOD> The seal and the whale are mine
<GOOD> I don't blame them because I genuinely find them agonising to draw from like 60% of angles
<GOOD> Oh these are our like, Splatoon OCs so the entire team is based on marine mammals
<GOOD> They're called SEAL team 6 (Del and Daph are clones of one another so they're 1 member)
<GOOD> I don't really care it's just for flavour
<GOOD> I don't think we have done a manatee actually
<GOOD> We've done a few groups of animals now
<GOOD> Some manta rays, sharks, jellyfish, various regular fish, but this is the last team we're making for now
<GOOD> I do have to do a pirahna design still tho for a different group
<GOOD> I'm doing a coralfish Pierrot rn
<GOOD> I've only doodled ideas so far tho
<GOOD> It's a shame I have to kill off my leopard seal dude like immediately but he deserves it
<GOOD> Check my cove.
<GOOD> I made one vaguely based on a peacock mantis shrimp, but it's in the form of a giant mech made of scrap metal
<GOOD> Like Ahtal Ka Monster Hunter (goated monster)
<GOOD> We love Ahtal Ka
<GOOD> When you get to Monster Hunter final boss but it's Egyptian
<GOOD> It's fine I... I just didn't expect it to be Egyptian
<GOOD> Yeah and it's fucking awesome
<GOOD> I gave my friend this vocal stim
<GOOD> Also Marcel how do you even make a Pokesona
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah I love barbers trim my hair vro
<GOOD> Beautiful as always
<GOOD> So adorable
<GOOD> Also I don't know how to make a character that's bipedal walk on all fours
<GOOD> I just morphed their limbs into quadripedal limbs
<GOOD> (they're a living fission reactor/sci fi element maker)
<GOOD> Their stomach forms compounds that it expels
<GOOD> My fish army grows ever stronger
<GOOD> There's Devil rays
<GOOD> Apparently there is a sea devil that's an anglerfish
<GOOD> Also Marcel wishes to make a Scrafty Poksona just as Scrafty climbs my favourite Pokmon list, I will be sued for plagiarism
<GOOD> I would have plausible deniability if it was Eevee or smth but SCRAFTY?
<GOOD> I'm getting sued bro
<GOOD> They should allow you to buy verification and call it Bluesky Blue
<GOOD> Smaller usually means better tbh
<GOOD> Idk what mon to make it
<GOOD> Ledian isn't it rn, it may be either Sigilyph or Scrafty
<GOOD> Ledian ofc exists in my top 5 still but aaaa
<GOOD> Darn
<GOOD> I genuinely don't know what mon fits me
<GOOD> I don't think I'd want to have Ledian
<GOOD> Problematic sona...
<GOOD> I will have to peruse more species
<GOOD> the pope died
<GOOD> I'm spreading the news
<GOOD> Like that one image of the guy on the horse
<GOOD> My announcement that I'm running for Pope
<GOOD> I wouldn't call it controversial unless I was being an ass about it
<GOOD> If I started trashing the Catholic church maybe
<GOOD> But the dude's dead
<GOOD> It sucks because he was chill somewhat
<GOOD> He would have loved Deltarune chapter 3
<GOOD> I might unironically pour one out for him on Switch 2 release date
<GOOD> Because he already planned 5 chapters I think
<GOOD> Did they add Ronaldo
<GOOD> I thought he died of pneumonia tbh
<GOOD> THEY PUT PAC MAN IN TEKKEN 8???
<GOOD> Where's Pac Man
<GOOD> Aw shit here comes Pac Man
<GOOD> Tbh I thought this post was telling me about the new Tekken 8 character for a second
<GOOD> Dipper who was the new character
<GOOD> I've played that game before
<GOOD> Actually a few weeks ago I played Luigi's Mansion Arcade
<GOOD> It killed me almost immediately
<GOOD> It was a very fun experience tho
<GOOD> Weird AI
<GOOD> I'm an AI someone look at my AI art
<GOOD> Reading this in the cadence of that one Stanley Parable commercial
<GOOD> Every sheet can hold up to an entire game's worth of code
<GOOD> Dipper what Pokmon fits me
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Just like Koraidon
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is so cool
<GOOD> Bounty what Pokmon fits me
<GOOD> OH SHIT
<GOOD> I love Elgyem sm
<GOOD> One of my favourite mons as a kid and my favourite unevolved mon
<GOOD> I'm honestly mildly hurt that you said Palpitoad but I like the others
<GOOD> Idk about Beheeyem because it's that colour
<GOOD> Plus Elgyem is cute and has a tail
<GOOD> Elgyem may be the frontrunner
<GOOD> Watch Godzilla Minus one
<GOOD> I think Elgyem should be blue tho
<GOOD> *Beheeyem
<GOOD> Ik but it's a sona so it has to represent me at least a little
<GOOD> Guys I know, I should do Eevee!!!
<GOOD> No one has done Eevee before
<GOOD> Oh true actually
<GOOD> Lime green Beheeyem
<GOOD> You shouldn't
<GOOD> Goodbye, Dipper.
<GOOD> I like some things
<GOOD> This is true however
<GOOD> Because PLA is quite boring I think
<GOOD> Dipper don't send that fuckass gif istg
<GOOD> I'm not that friend that doesn't like anything
<GOOD> I'm that friend that likes things in moderation
<GOOD> I just happen to like good things
<GOOD> As opposed to Legends Arceus
<GOOD> I don't like Friday Night Funkin
<GOOD> Also I was lying I love bad things usually
<GOOD> I don't dislike it either mind you
<GOOD> It has Sonic.exe so that's neat
<GOOD> I like Sonic.exe personally
<GOOD> He's one of my favourite old creepypastas
<GOOD> Are you sure
<GOOD> I like Jump Force
<GOOD> It's really hard to tell when I'm not baiting tbh
<GOOD> My takes range from horrendous to I'm lying to you
<GOOD> I unironically love Jump Force and Multiversus, and I unironically don't like BotW that much
<GOOD> But I do like TotK
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I played BotW first, wasn't interested
<GOOD> Then played TotK and there was a lot cooler shit
<GOOD> Secret stones?
<GOOD> In relation to this I'm fairly sure the Sonia echo was one of the very first ones I got
<GOOD> Is the plot twist that Ganon betrayed Raaru
<GOOD> Fuck
<GOOD> (I know the actual twist but I'm not at that point in the game yet)
<GOOD> I'm doing the Mineru stuff rn
<GOOD> I know what it is
<GOOD> Rain World Echoes rock because they don't tell you anything at all
<GOOD> I like the one guy that says he's a landlord and that's why he's tortured forever tho
<GOOD> Imo yes because you don't really need to glean anything from the Echoes
<GOOD> Except that they were once alive and Ancients
<GOOD> what the fuck is that thing
<GOOD> I keep getting tiktoks geared towards autistic people
<GOOD> That's not what's happening it's just random
<GOOD> First one in my tiktok
<GOOD> Oh I see
<GOOD> I hope not
<GOOD> Also why bring up Chris Chan
<GOOD> Char do you like the AU version of my OC
<GOOD> I wanna draw
<GOOD> A new OC, no idea what tho
<GOOD> I might continue my space story
<GOOD> Vigoroth and Elgyem and Roggenrola are on my Poksona shortlist
<GOOD> A limiter?
<GOOD> I wanna draw so bad
<GOOD> I don't know what to
<GOOD> I need more ideas or at least the motivation
<GOOD> Don't know what to draw, don't have the motivation to draw stuff if I don't have an idea I like
<GOOD> Yeah idk what to, maybe it's because I've been drawing the past two days
<GOOD> And OC-ing
<GOOD> Rain World, FNaF, Dandadan, fish
<GOOD> Chainsaw Man, Dunmeshi, among other shit
<GOOD> Maybe I'm just burned out after making a bunch of Splatoon OCs
<GOOD> Chat how do you create a name for a dystopian ass fictional tech company
<GOOD> I've gotten a similar response in 2 different servers now
<GOOD> And yea -tech is the frontrunner for a suffix
<GOOD> Kagurabachi is so cold
<GOOD> Big fan of real penguins
<GOOD> They could
<GOOD> I don't know what to watch tbh I'm tapped out
<GOOD> I watched the movie The Batman
<GOOD> Chiikawa is awesome
<GOOD> I love Northernlion
<GOOD> My shitty phone doodle plot is coming along nicely
<GOOD> Blue
<GOOD> Why did it have to be Diablo 4
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> I miss good MonHun collabs I want Berserk x MonHun
<GOOD> Idk but it would be a crazy Palico costume
<GOOD> I still can't believe how much aura this Palico has
<GOOD> You can play as the cat in this game
<GOOD> So I'm very glad it has the armour
<GOOD> I wanna draw stuff but I might just keep imagining OC stuff
<GOOD> The bat devil
<GOOD> I need Chainsaw Man back
<GOOD> I think it's a break week this week
<GOOD> I think so, Dandadan is also getting a movie of the first few eps of S2 soon
<GOOD> So I'm eating in the second half of this year
<GOOD> I hope so
<GOOD> Seems like it is, I don't remember
<GOOD> I'm waiting for Dunmeshi season 2 also
<GOOD> I'm still waiting for Kagurabachi
<GOOD> The anime is soon, I feel it
<GOOD> Plus I need HIM to be animated even if he'll be in season 2 probably
<GOOD> Every villain in KB so far has been immaculate tbh
<GOOD> Hiruhiko is my favourite but Sojo and Yura are also rlly good
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> One of the bigger new manga
<GOOD> I'm inclined to disagree
<GOOD> All of the villains so far have had incredibly different designs
<GOOD> I have bad news for you
<GOOD> He's wearing a different fit, his face is a different shape, he's older, his hair is different, his scars are different
<GOOD> Sojo, Kyora, Hiruhiko and then ||Samura|| have all been pretty different even as far as arc villains go
<GOOD> Kagura Bachi
<GOOD> It's unironically the shonen I'm putting all my stocks into tbh
<GOOD> I need more anime, screams
<GOOD> Wait I should totally make a Kagurabachi OC shiiiit
<GOOD> I need to make a few fandom OCs
<GOOD> I just realised that Kagurabachi might be like, maybe even halfway through
<GOOD> Idk what they're gonna do after this storyline
<GOOD> I don't know which fandom to make an OC For first aaaaaa
<GOOD> SKIBIDI TOILET IS BACK??
<GOOD> I wish I still played Fortnite I would cop that shit
<GOOD> I need to think of magic to give my character tbh
<GOOD> And then promptly take away when they get a cool sword
<GOOD> Raaaagh why does the author have to take the cool ideas
<GOOD> I can't do storms, fish, bugs, birds or parties
<GOOD> Anti dandruff shampoo
<GOOD> I remember the strat from primary school
<GOOD> Is this about Multiversus
<GOOD> New season?
<GOOD> New Multiversus season, Miles Morales will be there
<GOOD> I've been holding my Shadow Squishmallow like a baby for 3 hours
<GOOD> Is this how moms feel
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah
<GOOD> Up charging my blade
<GOOD> Hunting my horn
<GOOD> Switching my axe, if you will
<GOOD> I actually don't like Swaxe as much
<GOOD> This is what I do to people
<GOOD> Also word of the day is exhumed
<GOOD> Exhumed is a good word
<GOOD> Sure why not
<GOOD> Sephiroth has like, purple grape attack
<GOOD> I had Inazuma Eleven and Ultimate Muscle tbh
<GOOD> It taught me British people are evil
<GOOD> And Digimon and Dinosaur King
<GOOD> Kevin Mask is pretty goated
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Childhood shonen of mine
<GOOD> Not particularly, I'm only 20 soon
<GOOD> Kinnikuman is ancient, but Ultimate Muscle on Kix? Nah
<GOOD> Kinnikuman is like one of the oldest shonen manga
<GOOD> It was the inspiration for many shonen that came after
<GOOD> For plants, exploding seems like a viable strategy for me tbh
<GOOD> It's arguably one of the best ways for a plant to end its life cycle
<GOOD> Something like that
<GOOD> Milk hates the earth
<GOOD> I am tired of thinking about magic
<GOOD> I need magic for my character, and then I am going to take it away
<GOOD> Me reading Kinnikuman
<GOOD> The lesson is to never read
<GOOD> would be that way
<GOOD> I need to finish Gurren Lagann I have no other anime I want to watch
<GOOD> Unlimited anime but no anime
<GOOD> My friend keeps making me want to watch Fate like no
<GOOD> She keeps talking about evil priests be my guest
<GOOD> Watching another show and it starts putting evangelical themes in it
<GOOD> I watched Gaslight District the other day and I sighed when they mentioned Heaven
<GOOD> But tbh they did it super well so
<GOOD> I was rlly happy with it
<GOOD> I have no interest in Fate
<GOOD> I need more anime but I might just wait for season 2 of my faves
<GOOD> I need Denji back for the movie ASAP
<GOOD> DENNIS I MISS YOU
<GOOD> Dennis please
<GOOD> I like small scale fights tbh
<GOOD> Or when a massive power is actually shown as cataclysmic and unstoppable that's ok too
<GOOD> Chainsaw Man spoilers but this entire sequence is one of my favourites in manga
<GOOD> I have no idea how the anime is going to adapt this correctly
<GOOD> Gun devil is one of my favourites in Chainsaw Man
<GOOD> I mean Fujimotor is just goated
<GOOD> I can put up with his dead fish eating antics if it means more Chainsaw Man
<GOOD> And his threatening to kill art students
<GOOD> The author of Chainsaw Man has gone on record saying he ate a dead goldfish off the ground and considered killing his peers
<GOOD> He's kinda off kilter but he's awesome
<GOOD> Yeah being a bit of a freak helps the creative process
<GOOD> I know from experience genuinely
<GOOD> You need to be kind of weird as fuck to be a goated artist
<GOOD> 5 numbers
0 games
<GOOD> The no games joke will never leave my vocabulary tbh
<GOOD> It's so entertaining to me
<GOOD> Oh I know but I truly just find it that funny
<GOOD> ~~Also you don't play any of the exclusives because it doesn't have any~~
<GOOD> I'm a donkey Kong shill so I'm spoken for for the next decade
<GOOD> I can play like most generations of MH on my switch, 3DS and PC
<GOOD> So I have no issues because I don't like the ones I can't play lmao
<GOOD> I can play World but I don't really want to that much, and I could take or leave Wilds
<GOOD> Wilds seems a bit too introductory for my liking
<GOOD> I feel like a genwunner but World and Wilds truly are not my thing
<GOOD> They're too cinematic
<GOOD> I don't know if that's the right word
<GOOD> See I like them but they just don't reach the same level of enjoyment I gain from GU, 4U etc
<GOOD> I don't mind the cutscenes too much but by cinematic that's kinda what I mean
<GOOD> Where it's heavy plot focused with a bunch of look at this let me talk to you about this sections
<GOOD> BotW intro type shit
<GOOD> Like I get it you want to make a spectacle but please let me play
<GOOD> Also the wound system looks, not very fun
<GOOD> GU wrapped up the old part of the franchise, it's a celebration of it
<GOOD> Everything after is very different
<GOOD> It's not worse by any means, if anything it's probably better but I just don't like it as much
<GOOD> Also 4U's cutscenes have been peak so far
<GOOD> Every monster has a cutscene and they're so cool
<GOOD> Also you fight Gore Magala on a boat
<GOOD> Which I find very fun
<GOOD> But yea Wilds just feels like they're moving away from why I like MH which is fine
<GOOD> It's not like I'm gonna run out of old content
<GOOD> Haven't played yet
<GOOD> I heard it's more arcadey but I'm dubious
<GOOD> I will probably enjoy it tho
<GOOD> Honestly Nintendo is the only mf I trust with open world
<GOOD> I didn't like Elden Ring compared to its predecessors
<GOOD> I think Frontiers needed to be better
<GOOD> It wasn't that bad but it also wasn't that good
<GOOD> Frontiers is one of the reasons I don't want everything to move towards open world
<GOOD> Idk Odyssey felt tight as hell, I think open zones are the way forward
<GOOD> Just like an area with a shitload of things
<GOOD> That's a good direction
<GOOD> I hope Bananza does it too as a collectathon
<GOOD> Love DK
<GOOD> I mean yeah they were a handheld thing, you can collect a few in a session
<GOOD> It's quick and fast challenges and dopamine hits
<GOOD> For Mario I don't mind it
<GOOD> Since they still kept important moons and story stuff
<GOOD> Well yeah that's a given
<GOOD> DK is fucked up Mario
<GOOD> Making a hard 3D platformer is kinda hard without making it feel like abysmal dogshit tbh
<GOOD> If the character controls well then you already may have a difficulty issue
<GOOD> I struggled with that final rocket as a kid
<GOOD> 4th word
<GOOD> I love shovel Knight but this isn't about him
<GOOD> The challenges were annoying, at least as plague knight
<GOOD> I hate controlling plague knight
<GOOD> I'm playing it some time soon because it's Donkey Kong
<GOOD> I'm also looking forward to the upgraded versions and Mario kart
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> I am not particularly down today
<GOOD> Just sleepy
<GOOD> That's why I'm at a coffee shop
<GOOD> They can't do an iced latte
<GOOD> I'm just having a regular latte anyway
<GOOD> I can't stop thinking about my favourite things
<GOOD> I've been unwell for years but it flares up every few days and I become completely unable to do anything
<GOOD> It's fine, it's not something I'm particularly interested in but Spiderverse was good (I'm aware it's not MCU)
<GOOD> The last MCU movie I watched was NWH
<GOOD> Very very good movie
<GOOD> Might be my Green Goblin bias
<GOOD> I like Green Goblin he's such an asshole
<GOOD> Also I liked Far From Home but only the parts with Mysterio
<GOOD> I've used that one sequence (you know the one) for OC stuff so often
<GOOD> We love torturing characters
<GOOD> I knew but I like his design
<GOOD> The height of my Marvel phase was as a kid when I played Lego Marvel Super Heroes and 100%'d it
<GOOD> I do not know my favourite MCU characters
<GOOD> I couldn't watch gotg3
<GOOD> The other 2 were great tho
<GOOD> Animal abuse
<GOOD> I watched it but I had to stop paying attention for some scenes like that, it led to me not following but I won't hold that against the movie
<GOOD> Just not something I can watch
<GOOD> Yes, it's like the last movie I watched in theatres
<GOOD> It was kinda disappointing
<GOOD> But that's because it had big shoes to fill
<GOOD> I'm not exactly interested in the recent MCU
<GOOD> I watched that shit
<GOOD> I am not interested in Red Hulk that much
<GOOD> what's even coming out
<GOOD> What on Earth is Thunderbolts
<GOOD> I thought it was Shazam from the name ngl
<GOOD> Holds my nose as I say Shazam
<GOOD> Wait who are the members lemme go check
<GOOD> Ok I get it but
<GOOD> Idk there's just something about the MCU
<GOOD> Actually Deadpool v Wolverine was pretty good
<GOOD> Yeah and I don't recognise any of them
<GOOD> Honestly the only superhero movie I might watch this year is Superman
<GOOD> The trailers actually got me for that one
<GOOD> Dan Hentschel
<GOOD> I didn't even know there was a Fantastic Four movie coming out tbh
<GOOD> I only like Mr Fantastic
<GOOD> The MCU doesn't have the same reach it did before Endgame
<GOOD> I can literally just not engage with it and never see it
<GOOD> I think I'm just suffering MCU burnout tbh
<GOOD> It occurred to me when I was watching Red One with my family like 6 months ago at Christmas lmfao I was like what the fuck man
<GOOD> I'm not trying to be smug about it
<GOOD> They turned Santa into an MCU
<GOOD> Emblem... ENGAGE
<GOOD> I also have The Rock burnout
<GOOD> Captain America Chainsaw Man >>
<GOOD> That Fujimoto art of Captain America is so fucking cool
<GOOD> One of my favourites
<GOOD> If you google it it shows up immediately
<GOOD> I like how the shield covers its face
<GOOD> And the star is stabbing through its head
<GOOD> I somehow think Fujimoto is not a fan of America
<GOOD> Araki hates Japanese people as shown by Joseph /j
<GOOD> Can I be fr, that hierarchy of power in the MCU thing is one of the funniest ads I've ever seen
<GOOD> He really thought he ate
<GOOD> Araki: I love this celebrity!
Hokozano: I've been eating oats for breakfast recently.
Fujimoto eating a dead goldfish off the ground:
<GOOD> Fujimoto is such a freak
<GOOD> But the good kind of freak
<GOOD> Not the bad kind of freak
<GOOD> No there's different types of freak
<GOOD> Fujimoto is a freak but he is not freaky
<GOOD> He's just fucking weird
<GOOD> And I love him because our thoughts align a concerning amount
<GOOD> He taught me how to deal with art jealousy
<GOOD> It works it seems
<GOOD> Also I have been described as a somewhat intense person
<GOOD> I do but it's stuck in my head
<GOOD> Yeah the fishing industry is kinda fucked
<GOOD> The thing is that we don't know the real mortality rate of the crabs since we bleed and release sometimes
<GOOD> And we take like quite a lot of blood
<GOOD> Yea exactly
<GOOD> The 200k is only the ones in our care
<GOOD> But after release they have a slew of issues
<GOOD> And we don't have the means to collect data on it
<GOOD> It detects toxins from bacteria
<GOOD> I was under the impression it only detected endotoxins rather than cleaned them
<GOOD> Doesn't it coagulate or smth
<GOOD> But yes we harvest and bleed horseshoe crabs because they have somewhat widespread biomedical purposes
<GOOD> Little babies :<
<GOOD> Not really no
<GOOD> They don't have pincers afaik
<GOOD> They're just flat domes
<GOOD> They're like Kabuto
<GOOD> They aren't actually crabs
<GOOD> They're closer to like, spiders
<GOOD> And scorpions according to Wikipedia
<GOOD> But yea a lot of things are named based on old morphology/appearance classification rather than actual categories
<GOOD> Also can I just say it annoys me when people say Killer Whales aren't whales
<GOOD> Baby
<GOOD> Look at all of them
<GOOD> Anomalocaris my goat
<GOOD> But yea horseshoe crabs are goated
<GOOD> They barely change over millions of years and it mostly works out for them
<GOOD> Yea horseshoe crabs crawl to shore en masse to breed
<GOOD> I hate when people say killer whales aren't actually whales, they're dolphins
<GOOD> Like thanks for trying to be an intellectual dipshit but it doesn't work
<GOOD> That's funny
<GOOD> Like dolphins are whales too RAAAAAAAGH
<GOOD> Oh right  their blood is blue if you were curious
<GOOD> Yeah they're adorable things, it really sucks that they get harvested for the blood
<GOOD> Aren't horseshoe crab eyes like, on the top
<GOOD> You can see them
<GOOD> I forget about that
<GOOD> They aren't crabs and tbh I don't know that many real crabs
<GOOD> We mostly spent our crustacean lessons studying their anatomy
<GOOD> Gastrodon should have a radular tooth and learn horn drill
<GOOD> Isopod
<GOOD> I don't know if it's a specific species
<GOOD> Anyway let's talk about goat
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> My actual favourite marine category is gastropods but Chinese giant salamanders go crazy
<GOOD> Can we talk about this adorable baby
<GOOD> I love cone snails
<GOOD> Cone snail
<GOOD> Never touch one but I agree
<GOOD> They have built in harpoons it's very cool
<GOOD> Me when I get stabbed by the harpoon that kills you
<GOOD> Oh also I like Sea Hares a lot
<GOOD> Sea hares are adorable
<GOOD> Iirc they're the largest gastropod
<GOOD> Sea bunnies are overrated I fear
<GOOD> Sea hares are cuter
<GOOD> They're huge
<GOOD> Big ass gastropod
<GOOD> They are not poisonous
<GOOD> In fact touching them is dangerous to them, not us
<GOOD> Touching random sea creatures is ill advised for this reason
<GOOD> Because a lot of them can get sick from human touch
<GOOD> I see
<GOOD> They look like mole rats
<GOOD> Ooo
<GOOD> Nether
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Chat I need advice, does this diagram make sense
<GOOD> How I feel searching Japanese clothing on Pinterest because idk the name of the clothes genre
<GOOD> It just comes up with the manga I'm drawing a character for, like this shit isn't really an outfit
<GOOD> I don't know what manner of clothing this is
<GOOD> Imo it's great
<GOOD> It's good as hell
<GOOD> Yea I like the demon portrayal
<GOOD> I don't know
<GOOD> I don't want to watch it because it's a bad demon depiction
<GOOD> Frieren has a great demon depiction
<GOOD> I think making them human predators is one of my favourite interpretations
<GOOD> I forgot that some chat members are like 13
<GOOD> Anyway she's fucking awesome and the show is p good
<GOOD> I don't interact with frieren fans, if you were to interact with half of the popular anime then this would check out tho
<GOOD> JJK, Dandadan, MHA, Frieren, etcetc
<GOOD> Fans of a thing tend to suck
<GOOD> Oh, I burned out I'm making a Kagurabachi OC
<GOOD> Yeah I know
<GOOD> I need to think of a magic katana but Hokozano took all the cool ideas
<GOOD> Considering the themes of the movies and bullheaded oldhead views of Miyazaki I wouldn't put it past a few fans to be strange
<GOOD> But by and large you're probably right
<GOOD> They didn't
<GOOD> The majority were citizens rather than political figures villainising the island
<GOOD> This is also a bad take
<GOOD> It's not a binary solution
<GOOD> That's why it was a disgusting shortsighted final solution that he was forced to do
<GOOD> UTDR is one community
<GOOD> They aren't separate entities
<GOOD> Bro is Zeke
<GOOD> I like when villains completely bare faced lie to justify killing a bunch of people and then the audience is like that makes sense, it happens with like every Metal Gear Solid antagonist
<GOOD> Ppl saying Armstrong was right like lmaooooo
<GOOD> I'm gonna end all war are you dumb
<GOOD> The Patriots especially btw
<GOOD> People still think that the Patriots were correct
<GOOD> And Solidus
<GOOD> Ocelot only didn't suck because he didn't have greater ambitions for the country in the games I've played
<GOOD> Griffith ain't even in that genre of villain he's just bare faced evil
<GOOD> He doesn't even lie about it
<GOOD> It's pretty good
<GOOD> There literally is not a permanent solution Thanos could have done but at the same time he could have done anything else or just not done anything at all, that's why it was justification for him to just kill people because of his immutable belief that killing people would help
<GOOD> Imo anything Thanos would have done would have been temporary and exploitable
<GOOD> But almost anything would have been better
<GOOD> I mean he does, the reason is spite
<GOOD> It's not a good reason
<GOOD> He wanted to ascend and become the planet
<GOOD> Tede?
<GOOD> Well fucking yeah lol he tried to kill everyone on the planet
<GOOD> Actually I've forgiven people that killed entire races and destroyed planets before
<GOOD> Hm
<GOOD> Ir was literally premeditated
<GOOD> It's what he wanted to do before he even started getting the stones
<GOOD> Also there is no permanent solution that the stones could have done but he still chose like the worst solution
<GOOD> I mean you could solve it but it would still be horrifically immoral, i.e the physically limiting childbirth
<GOOD> You could create double the resources forever but it would be monopolised and people would still starve for example
<GOOD> The stones do not actually have a moral solution to the resource issue
<GOOD> There are more noble uses of it
<GOOD> But there's no permanent solution that's not awful
<GOOD> That's immoral
<GOOD> Taking away free will is incredibly immoral lol
<GOOD> Ask who
<GOOD> That's not how free will works it's not a democratic choice to erase free will
<GOOD> Even if you were to give every individual the option, the vast majority would just say no and nothing would change
<GOOD> Making everyone immortal would also suck
<GOOD> It's just a name
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Also making half of a population infertile does not solve the issue at all
<GOOD> It just slows down the inevitable
<GOOD> That's just killing everyone
<GOOD> You see how this doesn't solve the issue right
<GOOD> Then it's a temporary solution
<GOOD> Even if Thanos created free food for everyone forever, he doesn't actually solve every resource issue
<GOOD> This is still temporary
<GOOD> If 50% of people are still able to have kids past that point then the species can still grow
<GOOD> Furthermore, overpopulation is a CURRENT issue, not just a future one
<GOOD> 2 things can be true
<GOOD> On the whole, the existence of humanity at this scale is killing the planet because of general consumption and industrialisation
<GOOD> In an ideal world then we wouldn't be having environmental issues but yk
<GOOD> My Kagurabachi OC goes crazy
<GOOD> Yeah I'm aware, in an ideal world this is the case but it's just not the case
<GOOD> 8 billion people is simply a lot of people
<GOOD> That's 8x a lot of lions
<GOOD> I wanna talk about my favourite villain but it's a twist villain so I can't
<GOOD> Dunmeshi spoilers but my favourite villain is this guy
<GOOD> Master manipulator at work
<GOOD> You would fall for it
<GOOD> I didn't mean it like that
<GOOD> it being the ruse
<GOOD> His lying ass would ensnare you
<GOOD> Enjoy being ||the next depressed ass mentally ill dungeon lord|| vro
<GOOD> You would feel apathetic
<GOOD> I wanna rewatch Dunmeshi now
<GOOD> For the 4th time
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I like when characters want to make everyone immortal/a setting where everyone is immortal
<GOOD> Trying to put cool Japanese clothes on a character without putting a Hakama on them is hell
<GOOD> It makes me seem like the white person in the kimono
<GOOD> This is like the plot of Rain World
<GOOD> Everyone being all spiritual and immortal to try and ascend until they find acid that kills you forever and lets you escape the cycle, and then they IMMEDIATELY start killing themselves in acid
<GOOD> Yeah the dudes in the cycle found that out the hard way
<GOOD> These fits kinda go hard but they're so basic
<GOOD> What about Saltydkdan
<GOOD> Aughhh I can't come up with a design
<GOOD> I'm so cooked
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> Oh right Switch 2 America preorders go up today
<GOOD> I'm trying so fucking hard and my art just sucks
<GOOD> I'm gonna avoid it
<GOOD> But I'm excited for the anime I've already watched this year
<GOOD> I need the second seasons raaaa
<GOOD> Not even a reference lmao
<GOOD> They put him in as a character, then made him right about everything
<GOOD> The glazing is next level
<GOOD> Shit may as well have been a Simpsons appearance
<GOOD> We live in a dark timeline
<GOOD> Bro the Switch 2 is doing crazy in Japan, not unsuprising but zamn
<GOOD> 2.2 million preorders on My Nintendo Store Japan alone apparently
<GOOD> I need to practice poses still but it's pissing me off
<GOOD> I'm doing so badly
<GOOD> Does Northernlion count
<GOOD> Goat
<GOOD> My OC getting a cool ass power temporarily because I haven't figured out what to replace it with yet
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Headache
<GOOD> I sent it here earlier but it's these rings that pop and then turn into malleable spirit energy
<GOOD> I do not know what the power that replaces it will be
<GOOD> It will be a sword of some kind
<GOOD> Nubby's Number Factory
<GOOD> I feel like that white guy Japan image still man I cannot use these fits for a design
<GOOD> She's a ball
<GOOD> Laughing again at this thumbnail
<GOOD> They distilled Arlo into 1 concentrated video
<GOOD> I want money for plushies
<GOOD> C
<GOOD> It's the game chat button
<GOOD> Nobody will be able to afford a home ever that's just how it is
<GOOD> Game chat
<GOOD> Calls Miyamoto
<GOOD> The C button goes directly to Miyamoto so you can complain to him
<GOOD> Tbf a headcount of 8 billion people is far too many people
<GOOD> I bite people in my territory
<GOOD> I would say I'm an average person
<GOOD> But that's better than last year
<GOOD> The population is like 100 if we're being fr, you don't need more than that
<GOOD> It's also why naming 100 women is so difficult
<GOOD> They just don't exist
<GOOD> I should name 100 women at some point but I'd be afraid I wouldn't know that many people of either gender
<GOOD> I should name 100 people in general
<GOOD> Presenting fem on that day so I can write myself down
<GOOD> Checkmate
<GOOD> I ate the 25%
<GOOD> {RTXtuff} must rise
<GOOD> Balarina capucina
<GOOD> Lalalala
<GOOD> How is {RTXtuff} already in the popular bar
<GOOD> I think people that eat fugu are desperate for attention
<GOOD> Like why are you eating that
<GOOD> Poisonous fish
<GOOD> It's like the one in the Simpsons
<GOOD> Like surely it doesn't taste nice
<GOOD> Have you guys seen that one bird ppl eat where they have the blanket over their head while they eat it
<GOOD> I heard about it the other day it's fucked up
<GOOD> Bounty do you know Ortolan I just found its name again
<GOOD> Some decadence has to be considered actually evil at some point like bro
<GOOD> It's a common belief that it's done to hide your face from God because the act is so grossly decadent
<GOOD> At least I heard that
<GOOD> I don't know you literally have to pick the bones out as you eat it
<GOOD> Some gourmands are just too extra with it
<GOOD> And I'm the kind of person to want to eat exotic meats
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> People eat anything ngl
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Snakes are all bones and muscle pretty much
<GOOD> Swordfish was yummy when I tried it
<GOOD> Very yummy
<GOOD> Maybe I was placebo'd I was pretty young
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I answered the wrong message
<GOOD> But yes it was in a Sam o nella video
<GOOD> Easily the eaten sharks one
<GOOD> Did you guys know shark skin is actually completely smooth like a diver's suit
<GOOD> It's so smooth that your hand just glides along it
<GOOD> No I'm a marine biologist I would never lie about the shark skin thing
<GOOD> Sharks are famously very smooth
<GOOD> (I'm lying)
<GOOD> Sharks have sandpaper skin
<GOOD> I just like lying about the shark skin thing because it's funny
<GOOD> That one Regular show episode about the burrito
<GOOD> The every meat taco
<GOOD> Also at least fish is the most vague name for an ingredient possible
<GOOD> Maybe behind meat
<GOOD> Fish is so broad they could feed you poison frfr
<GOOD> Is it even legal to serve it there
<GOOD> That feels like something that wouldn't be legal
<GOOD> Screams because now I have to start practicing this again
<GOOD> Drawing the poses
<GOOD> Interesting
<GOOD> But I have to sleep now
<GOOD> Seems like all the preorders are clogged up
<GOOD> I'm glad I got mine
<GOOD> I'm watching Indie Cross just finished episode 1
<GOOD> Indie cross went kinda crazy
<GOOD> YouTube solo animated series of indie games crossing over
<GOOD> Like Death Battle if it actually had good characterisation and didn't care about scaling that much
<GOOD> It only has 2 eps that total an hour so far
<GOOD> I want a slugcat in the next episode
<GOOD> I don't know which one
<GOOD> I'm excited to see how MK World's meta develops
<GOOD> They murdered bagging in a dark alley so
<GOOD> It seems pretty hard to not frontrun, and if you do you get fucked up anyway so it's gonna be a rough one
<GOOD> Just saw Sprunki plushies irl this can't be my life
<GOOD> Holy fuck
<GOOD> I went into a HMV looking for FNaF stuff and came out realising I'm a dying breed
<GOOD> I'm going insane this is the only semi decent merch I've found for a thing I like today
<GOOD> Sephiroth was gonna blow up Shinra which was based but he was also gonna use his god powers to exterminate everyone which is unbased
<GOOD> He also released Weapon which was unbased
<GOOD> I mean he purposely injured the Earth which was what caused that
<GOOD> Assuming Necrozma is sentient and aware of morality, it would still be wrong to retaliate and kill everyone on the planet
<GOOD> Having wrong done to you doesn't justify you doing wrong
<GOOD> I don't disagree but it's a bad reason lol
<GOOD> For Sephiroth's final smash he should put you in midgar then blow it up
<GOOD> Like K Rool or Ridley
<GOOD> *Nibelheim not Midgar
<GOOD> It was 1:30am when I first fought Sephiroth after a binge and when that animation kept going I said come the fuck on out loud
<GOOD> Or maybe it was hurry the fuck up
<GOOD> Tbf I get it
<GOOD> That kid hasn't broken his mewing streak
<GOOD> +2
<GOOD> It's goated
<GOOD> Who up force activating they cheese house
<GOOD> Pregnancy test
<GOOD> WHERE IS VOLUME 1
<GOOD> I didn't end up buying any
<GOOD> Trying to teach someone basic fighting game concepts and I wanna put my head through a wall
<GOOD> I thought this would be simple enough
<GOOD> I went into a toy shop and they still didn't have anything I wanted to buy
<GOOD> Whole shelf but still an ass selection
<GOOD> Actually Mario only had a shelf too
<GOOD> The 8 year old child asking for a blue flicky action figure:
<GOOD> THIS WAS THE ENTIRE FNaF section in HMV too
<GOOD> I count like 10 pieces of FNaF merch there total
<GOOD> Am I a dying species
<GOOD> I don't think Mario toys are unpopular they're just there
<GOOD> I wanted to go down this aisle to look at Kuromi but I was too scared
<GOOD> If they made more DK stuff I'd cop
<GOOD> Pretty big fan of this gif
<GOOD> There were Sprunki toys on a cart outside
<GOOD> I think I saw a kid buy one
<GOOD> One of my friends is a huge Monster High fan so we go to the toy shop together
<GOOD> Oddly enough no, but there were official Huggies in the HMV stire
<GOOD> Look at the FNaF pic again
<GOOD> Helluva Boss in the Horror section is really funny byw
<GOOD> I keep getting an animation on my tiktok fyp of one of the characters shootung themselves in the head
<GOOD> And apparently it's making rounds in the fandom but I'm like why do I keep seeing this
<GOOD> ~~Well now I know why Scott is there~~ /hj
<GOOD> I don't buy much FNaF merch at all
<GOOD> Not because I'm boycotting or anything
<GOOD> They just never make good merch
<GOOD> I wanted this Youtooz Springbonnie but it was 35 like fuck off
<GOOD> *yellow rabbit
<GOOD> I want the Mimic hexplush but I like plushies I can cuddle
<GOOD> So I really want the Rain World Watcher plush
<GOOD> Yea and that's cool
<GOOD> I do really want the Mimic hexplush because god knows we aren't getting any official shit for The Mimic
<GOOD> Scott where is the fucking PROMOTION
<GOOD> WHERE IS THE SOTM PROMOTION SCOTT
<GOOD> SCOOOOOTTTTTTTTT
<GOOD> The ouroboros of content of saying something like a mild innuendo on purpose and then being like oh my god chat that's not what I meant at all!!!!!!!!
<GOOD> Please don't mock me guys I only said something like that on purpose so you'd do exactly that
<GOOD> This shit tough as hell I should buy this
<GOOD> They need to hurry up Garten of Banban 0 was like a month ago
<GOOD> It had a lore reason you remember
<GOOD> Who wanted one of these
<GOOD> I thought this was that fuckass cat from Persona
<GOOD> I love bad plushies
<GOOD> Because anime SUCKS
<GOOD> We all know this
<GOOD> Pochita is the only good plush of an anime character I've seen
<GOOD> I need at least one of these
<GOOD> The displeasing texturw is the worst
<GOOD> I checked the tag it said JJK
<GOOD> I think her name is Nobara
<GOOD> I'm probably getting my friend a custom keychain of my friend's OCs for her birthday
<GOOD> Amazon seems to do them cheap
<GOOD> I can't believe my bigass group of OCs I made with my bestie is almost done
<GOOD> I need to do a head count of every character
<GOOD> Ok I did a head count me and bestie have made 23 full designs for this organisation alone so far
<GOOD> Actually I think I missed one or two
<GOOD> Switch 2 is exciting
<GOOD> I wanna Bananza and play as Pianta
<GOOD> Part 6 is fun
<GOOD> I am excited for Part 7
<GOOD> I am not excited for Part 8
<GOOD> Anasui and Weather won against Bohemian Rhapsody
<GOOD> One Piece doesn't even have the most episodes of an anime
<GOOD> Detective Conan fucks him up
<GOOD> I do not think Vaporeon is any more popular than the other Eeveelutions for any benign reason
<GOOD> Umbreon is the golden child
<GOOD> I would agree to that yes
<GOOD> I saw
<GOOD> I just don't have anything to say about it
<GOOD> I need more Sigilyph merch
<GOOD> And Elgyem
<GOOD> Reddit comment sections
<GOOD> This is a subtle reference to Elon Musk being stupid
<GOOD> I have a trans flag in my pfp I'm well aware
<GOOD> I think joining a 13+ discord as Drake is as thin as the ice could get
<GOOD> That's what my dad told me before I went to uni
<GOOD> I think my dad is weird too
<GOOD> You only needed to say 3 things that rhymed and you fucked it up
<GOOD> It doesn't have any flow
<GOOD> You are saying packgod insults
<GOOD> I didn't know that was this year
<GOOD> We should move that shit
<GOOD> But idc about football so
<GOOD> PIANTA MENTIONED RAAAAAA I'M A CHUCKSTER
<GOOD> Arlo in chat
<GOOD> Guys guess who I met while out in public today
<GOOD> He was just walking around bro
<GOOD> I didn't know there were more in other locations I just like, came across bro
<GOOD> I hate when people steal random silly shit like standees
<GOOD> Can I be fr I don't care about council property damage I just think it's context dependent
<GOOD> Idc if you steal a street sign I care if you tie up a swing set
<GOOD> I mean like, trashing parks
<GOOD> This thing so cool
<GOOD> It's a vulture but I agree
<GOOD> Well it's called a vulture
<GOOD> I didn't even find many FNaF funkos today
<GOOD> It was mostly expensive ass youtooz shit
<GOOD> I don't but I'm not buying that shit, look how little there is too
<GOOD> FNaF fans are a dying breed
<GOOD> We are going extinct
<GOOD> Why would this be my house
<GOOD> I have no favourite game tbh
<GOOD> All of them have issues
<GOOD> Imo FNaF 3 has the best aura tho
<GOOD> The cam renders go crazy
<GOOD> I actually like our newgen fans
<GOOD> The old guard needs to let FNaF stick around
<GOOD> It's the most random game in the series
<GOOD> It needs fixing but idk how to do that
<GOOD> Springtrap having an entirely RNG chance to ignore you sucks
<GOOD> It's good for horror but it's also frustrating
<GOOD> We'll be around forever don't worry
<GOOD> I don't draw FNaF enough, I workshopped an OC then never made it fully
<GOOD> Mine was a wolverine
<GOOD> But an animatronic shark.....
<GOOD> I hope your spite can be put into more productive things eventually
<GOOD> Anyway the most frequent FNaF merch at HMV was the books
<GOOD> There were so fucking many books
<GOOD> Like idk how they still have that many lmaooo
<GOOD> Who up chasing they Plushtrap
<GOOD> SotM in 50 days btw
<GOOD> FNaF discussion without the FNaF should have ended after FNaF (arbitrary number) challenge
<GOOD> I don't mind post 6 being a second arc of the story
<GOOD> I think Steel Wool did it pretty well
<GOOD> Springlocks don't do that tho
<GOOD> Wounds also just don't work that way
<GOOD> This is an arcade game
<GOOD> Yeah being stabbed doesn't make blood explode from your body
<GOOD> It's meant to portray it but it's not literal
<GOOD> I don't disagree I just think that if you're going for how would this actually look then you're getting what we got
<GOOD> Not taking a side here (I do not vibe with Scott after this either way) but google doesn't help
<GOOD> But yk, rule 2 I'm backing off
<GOOD> I don't vibe with like half the people that make FNaF content tho so
<GOOD> I do not remember Scott saying that
<GOOD> I can still not vibe w him, I'm not sending hate his way but my opinion of him was still soured by it
<GOOD> I do not remember the part at the bottom where he says I'm a Christian. I'm {politics}. And then talks about cancellation
<GOOD> People talk about the removed Fanverse every time it's brought up
<GOOD> But yea I do not like Scott that much and that's ok
<GOOD> Was this half a sentence
<GOOD> Summoning the everyone sucks in the situation bomb because the FNaF fanbase is rabid
<GOOD> Nah I'm still talking FNaF idgaf I'm just not talking about Bonnie for president
<GOOD> PIANTA MENTIONEDDDD
<GOOD> This is canon because of that one render
<GOOD> Bonnie simply trained to hover more than 3 inches off the ground
<GOOD> I mean the floating Bonnie render
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Why didn't he use this power against Springtrap
<GOOD> 39:
<GOOD> I should attempt to draw Springtrap
<GOOD> Did you watch Indie Cross, Ellie
<GOOD> Darn
<GOOD> Do you mind if I send a gif from it
<GOOD> This animation is so fucking cool
<GOOD> I should play Glitched Attraction
<GOOD> But I already know the solutions
<GOOD> I think Glitched Attraction is good
<GOOD> The games in question:
<GOOD> ......?
<GOOD> Dude someone didn't know who Ben Drowned was the other day, my kind is dying out
<GOOD> I disagree with Bendy
<GOOD> My kind really is dying out
<GOOD> Erm... Ever heard of Escape from Sewer, BUDDY?
<GOOD> Or was it Trapped in Sewer
<GOOD> I'm joking dw
<GOOD> Thank you
<GOOD> Guys let's all play The Park
<GOOD> We love The Park
<GOOD> Guys I can't WAIT for FNaF+
<GOOD> FNaF+ is gonna be so awesome when it releases
<GOOD> I am excited!
<GOOD> I thought this was Laios
<GOOD> Tealerland is a pretty awesome fangame that we moved on from pretty fast tbh
<GOOD> I like Tealerland a lot
<GOOD> Understanding the distinction is important
<GOOD> Guys I'm so excited for all 5 Fanverse games to release
<GOOD> We are absolutely getting all 5 Fanverse games
<GOOD> Scott politics talk was brought up then broken up by Hexy
<GOOD> Now we're back to FNaF because I wanna talk about FNaF
<GOOD> And I can't go back in my box I wanna talk about FNaF
<GOOD> I'm literally crossing my fingers hoping Kane doesn't get kicked out of the Fanverse
<GOOD> Kane is a risky person to bet on but I want Popgoes to release bro it looks awesome
<GOOD> Nothing recent but I feel like the pot is always simmering with him
<GOOD> After he sent the In my head I'm always {redacted}. Always. Message I had to keep my eye on the stove
<GOOD> Booting up the next Fanverse release:
Five Nights at WHAT???
<GOOD> Secret Scott collab
<GOOD> See I don't really care if he gets comeuppance or not I just want the fucking game lmaoooo
<GOOD> I just want the horse to cross the line
<GOOD> Why did he release 2 games that aren't Evergreen
<GOOD> I know they're good
<GOOD> Bro none of the flagship games have released yet  (don't mention Flumpty's)
<GOOD> I don't count Flumpty's because it got retroactively taken out of the Fanverse
<GOOD> It has flat modes but the VR version is awesome I played it like a few weeks ago
<GOOD> Oh I love Flumpty's which is why it sucked
<GOOD> I loved Riddle School too
<GOOD> I think Flumpty's has a crazy good art style
<GOOD> Blam is still one of my favourite FNaF fan characters
<GOOD> He's so cool
<GOOD> Wouldn't exclusively HW1 lore include that Glitchtrap is actual Afton again
<GOOD> I feel like that's unsatisfying
<GOOD> At least new lore makes it not Afton
<GOOD> It's my goat (my second favourite character)
<GOOD> It's part of the game
<GOOD> And the conversation was about lore
<GOOD> Wdym by it, make tape girl Glitchtrap?
<GOOD> I think it would have been interesting if it was explained yea I just needed clarification
<GOOD> I think that would be pretty neat
<GOOD> I still think that the whole cult of influence idea for the new FNaF arc could have been awesome
<GOOD> But the Mimic is good too
<GOOD> I like both ideas
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I love the working Mimic
<GOOD> I sure hope the creator's son is ok
<GOOD> I wonder what would happen if the creator of the Mimic were to fall into grief
<GOOD> I somehow never got interested in the walten files
<GOOD> And I like analogue horror
<GOOD> I like that one scene with the skinless animatronic and the Chica episode
<GOOD> That one's pretty good but I like Vita Carnis and Greylock Tapes
<GOOD> My friend likes The Painter and I had to grit my teeth
<GOOD> But it's fine that we disagree
<GOOD> I can't watch many analogue horror alone
<GOOD> I have to watch reactions so I can sleep at night
<GOOD> Especially the intruder analogue horrors
<GOOD> The Mimic mentioned (by me)
<GOOD> Chat do you fw the colours on my pfp
<GOOD> It's so muted, I fw it
<GOOD> I wanna buy a different frame but they're all kinda ass
<GOOD> And also expensive because Discord moment
<GOOD> My favourite rn are koi pond and constellation
<GOOD> You can buy without nitro
<GOOD> Oh, that's gore...
<GOOD> Trying Ultrakill again
<GOOD> I've already beaten it but I wanna get into it proper
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I'm scrolling Tiktok and the entire Helluva Boss fandom is melting down rn
<GOOD> Dude this fucking animation is flooding my fyp
<GOOD> I want a profile border that matches better
<GOOD> It's gone
<GOOD> Shadow is dead
<GOOD> I want the Arcane one but it's expensive, same as the constellation one or the koi pond
<GOOD> Making an angst OC rn
<GOOD> They're kinning AM so that's a fantastic start
<GOOD> Marcel did I show you paddington
<GOOD> I'm excited for Switch 2
<GOOD> I heard it's selling like hot cakes
<GOOD> Yea I'm gonna enjoy the upgrades too
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah
<GOOD> We love publicity
<GOOD> Preordered a few weeks ago yeah
<GOOD> On release day Deltarune, Mario Kart from the bundle and whatever upgrades I want
<GOOD> Probably Kirby and TotK
<GOOD> Bundle
<GOOD> This is untrue
<GOOD> It's not out on release day
<GOOD> It releases a month after which is when I shall buy it
<GOOD> I saw that, it is just them
<GOOD> I don't think there's enough to say what I'm not getting tbh
<GOOD> Like I want SF6, Cyberpunk etc but I can wait for those
<GOOD> The amount of misinformation around the Switch 2 has been insane
<GOOD> When I saw Bananza I thought it was Banjo Kazooie
<GOOD> Cement cement cement
<GOOD> Yoshikage Kira
<GOOD> I need to finish my character graph
<GOOD> Raaaagh I need more cute characters that I like a lot
<GOOD> This graph has too much central tendency
<GOOD> I'm trying not to harp on about the same franchises
<GOOD> Also did you guys see the
<GOOD> Guess
<GOOD> Yerp
<GOOD> Apparently it's suiting up to be lucratively successful, like moreso than any console yet
<GOOD> But I'll hold for now
<GOOD> I'm telling you dude, calling it Switch 2 was an insanely good play
<GOOD> I wanna draw and work but I can't do either
<GOOD> This is quite annoying
<GOOD> I'm very tempted to do waffle work and fill in the rest later
<GOOD> Because I need to write about some data I can't analyse without help, and I don't have the help yet
<GOOD> So I might just have to infer the results and write a bit
<GOOD> I just don't feel any inspo rn
<GOOD> Yuri achieved
<GOOD> And Tribulet is also there
<GOOD> I died 2 blinds later to a Plant I couldn't reroll
<GOOD> But that's ok
<GOOD> I got past Ante 8 with only Obelisk and Brainstorm
<GOOD> I did obviously change out some but it ended like that yeah
<GOOD> You should always be planetmaxxing and deckfixing
<GOOD> Fucking hate every stake after blue
<GOOD> I have like 7 gold stake wins but Blue sucks
<GOOD> Gold is every stake + Eternals + Temporary + Rentals etcetc
<GOOD> And faster scaling bc Purple stake(?)
<GOOD> Ok I have 8 decks beaten on Gold
<GOOD> I'm like halfway there on the others
<GOOD> I still don't know my favourite deck tbh
<GOOD> Might be Abandoned
<GOOD> Or Erratic if I'm resetting for a good deck
<GOOD> Checkered was my first gold but I didn't feel satisfied as much
<GOOD> I started on two pairs and flushes, then went to Pairs, and now I'm just playing 5oaks
<GOOD> I love 4 and 5oak builds
<GOOD> My first win was with two pair
<GOOD> It was the trousers which is still a goated joker
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> I've never tried matcha
<GOOD> I think so
<GOOD> I should get into ENA I keep getting Coral Glasses x Ena on my timeline
<GOOD> Oh the happiness
Everybody wants to be my friend
<GOOD> I love food
<GOOD> My name is DJ
Chat, I want some ice cream
DJ that is my name
DJ I want another, DJ
<GOOD> Ok now I have to try Matcha
<GOOD> There's no way Matcha is this yummy
<GOOD> Ts yummy (ts = this)
<GOOD> Gurt:
<GOOD> You really got me interested I kinda need a new ice cream flavour after all these years
<GOOD> Discovering Umami changed me
<GOOD> Not umami ice cream
<GOOD> But just umami as a flavour
<GOOD> I like brownie ice cream
<GOOD> I also like caramel but not when there's too much caramel
<GOOD> Banana lowkey gross
<GOOD> I tried Mango gelato a few weeks ago it was yummy
<GOOD> I wanna go back and try charcoal vanilla gelato
<GOOD> Have you guys ever tried kinder Bueno milkshake
<GOOD> I love kinder Bueno
<GOOD> The fucking Mimic
<GOOD> You want
<GOOD> Data analysis done
<GOOD> Sounds reasonable
<GOOD> But I'm already super intimidated
<GOOD> Honestly I still find Incin fun
<GOOD> He's like a Swiss army knife
<GOOD> I don't mind fighting Incin
<GOOD> Gengar and Dnite are goated gen 1 mons
<GOOD> I don't rlly care but if someone is annoying you then ignore them
<GOOD> If I speak
<GOOD> Gachiakuta too
<GOOD> Actually Gachi isn't SJ
<GOOD> Hmmmmm
<GOOD> Yeah anime this year
<GOOD> Either that or next year
<GOOD> I don't know about Dandadan, I don't think it has enough mass appeal
<GOOD> But all anime are weird so idk
<GOOD> Anyway Dandadan is awesome watch Dandadan if you can handle it
<GOOD> Chainsaw Man has already been hoisted up
<GOOD> It's wildly popular and will continue to be
<GOOD> Either way the Big 3 doesn't exist
<GOOD> Big 3 is specifically those 3 manga
<GOOD> There is none, you can argue who's gonna be the heavy hitters of SJ after but like
<GOOD> The Big 3 is One Piece, Naruto, Bleach
<GOOD> There won't be another one
<GOOD> Bleach is quite literally part of the Big 3 idc about your opinion of it
<GOOD> I haven't watched it
<GOOD> The Big 3 doesn't allude to quality, it refers to those 3 specific Shonen Jump manga
<GOOD> That's a bad team and also that's not the same at all
<GOOD> Either way idc I just think Kagurabachi will be successful
<GOOD> Which seems to bode well
<GOOD> The Big Three isn't a debatable thing as far as I know
<GOOD> It's literally just those 3 manga because they were the profitable ones that saved Shonen Jump or whatever
<GOOD> Dragonball is the dad, The Big 3 are the kids trust
<GOOD> I do like when people pretend YuYu Hakusho is on the same popularity level as Sailor Moon and Dragonball tho
<GOOD> Old ass anime by Hunter x Hunter guy
<GOOD> He's married to the Sailor Moon author
<GOOD> I really like YuYu Hakusho
<GOOD> And then Kinnikuman is even older
<GOOD> Kinnikuman is the grandpa
<GOOD> But once you go back that far you start going to like Astro Boy and shit
<GOOD> And enemies getting defeated then joining the main cast
<GOOD> It popularised like every shonen trope
<GOOD> it all worked out
<GOOD> Transposing all the data and then making 2 different plots
<GOOD> Now I'm doing disgusting coding
<GOOD> (did I tell you I had to do that)
<GOOD> I had to save it as a csv file and now I'm doing data analysis in R
<GOOD> Checking homogenity of variance, significance of values, etc
<GOOD> Data analysis is important but agonising
<GOOD> I have 4 windows open on my PC
<GOOD> And all of those windows have tabs
<GOOD> I've been mentally not well because of stuff I like pretty frequently I get it
<GOOD> I want my Rain World plushie so badly
<GOOD> Getting a shipment from America sucks
<GOOD> I want them so badly
<GOOD> YOOOOOO SF6 WITH DLC FOR 50
<GOOD> i finally get to get into SF
<GOOD> My ass maining Akuma
<GOOD> Does D&D count as a party
<GOOD> It's very fun and Smash is great with my friends tho
<GOOD> Idk usually D&D is chill asf and involves like 5 people, idk what constitutes as a party
<GOOD> I would rather die but I can see how that would be considered a party
<GOOD> I wonder if Tekken 8 is coming to Switch 2
<GOOD> Relaxing is one way to put it
<GOOD> Mega Sigilyph or Cacturne and I pop off
<GOOD> He's so fucking cool
<GOOD> Rayman when I break him out of the ice in Smash
<GOOD> I wonder what Pokmon the Dunmeshi cast would have
<GOOD> I hate it because the creator is a racist piece of shit but I think being annoyed at an unfaithful adaptation is ok
<GOOD> I am Dr Mario and I am saving lives
<GOOD> NOOOO
<GOOD> This shit is NOT Splatoon anymore
<GOOD> OC lore goes hard
<GOOD> What an odd thing to say
<GOOD> Not you to be clear
<GOOD> Speaking of extreme violence I need to play Ultrakill again
<GOOD> I mean yeah Pinnochio literally drinks that shit in the disney movie
<GOOD> Drugs aren't as normalised but tripping on benign stuff is a common joke in stuff like Simpsons
<GOOD> Yeah and he turns into a donkey
<GOOD> He went to like an island of gambling and sin
<GOOD> And almost turned into a donkey because he was turning bad
<GOOD> Me talking about Balatro, knowing full well an impressionable teen might end up playing it
<GOOD> It's like crack
<GOOD> Play it and you will understand
<GOOD> Yes it is good btw
<GOOD> Coin flick
<GOOD> Almost choked on my food because Northernlion made me laugh too hard
<GOOD> Hexy have you eaten any tongue slappers recently
<GOOD> Wdym I do that all the time
<GOOD> We say tongue slappers here in the UK
<GOOD> Or tongue ticklers if you're from the north
<GOOD> Anyone else getting Marlo AoT x Alex the Lion on their fyp or is that just me
<GOOD> I only have a few new guys to add yay
<GOOD> I'd say like 5 or 6 more and it's full
<GOOD> Rika
<GOOD> Just added Jenova
<GOOD> Now I just need the last few missing areas
<GOOD> Roxanne, Diligence, Cyn and Jenovah are all up there
<GOOD> Of course I would
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> I considered them as characters, if it was design only then it would be boring
<GOOD> Everyone on this list would be bad for me except like, Shadow lmao
<GOOD> And Shadow is my baby
<GOOD> Oh and Falin and Pomni ig
<GOOD> Yellow
<GOOD> I only know Raiden and he's going in the gender envy area so that's good
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> Hello hello
<GOOD> The Helluva boss fandom has invaded my fyp GO AWAY
<GOOD> Ugh I need to keep writing this is ass
<GOOD> I'm so excited for SF6 Switch 2
<GOOD> I'm gonna main the fuck out of Akuma
<GOOD> I wish I had my driving license but also driving literally isn't for me
<GOOD> I hate driving
<GOOD> I hate literally all of it
<GOOD> It makes me panic
<GOOD> I just don't get how driving can be fun for literally anyone
<GOOD> There is nothing enjoyable about it
<GOOD> I have 2 more characters before my graph is done yay
<GOOD> Probably because they want the shiny cards
<GOOD> Why did they name a Kirby track 2 planets approach the Roche Limit again
<GOOD> Like chill the fuck out
<GOOD> It was rhetorical moreso to frame the insane stakes of the song
<GOOD> Capcom fighting collection time to learn how to play Akuma
<GOOD> I wonder who the most iconic villain ever actually is
<GOOD> I cannot wait for more Kirby lore
<GOOD> Anyway Jamba heart lore yay
<GOOD> I will be excited to see what they do with it
<GOOD> WHY WASN'T INFINITE IN THE MOVIE INSTEAD OF EGGMAN
<GOOD> Honestly nah
<GOOD> King Boo was goated at least
<GOOD> Gurt
<GOOD> How is this a Splatoon OC
<GOOD> I think Sephiroth should be in more games
<GOOD> Can he be in Tekken next
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> They're awesome I love when mermaid characters have giant tails
<GOOD> I'm planning one where their body is like, absolutely tiny
<GOOD> And the tail is like the size of a small boat
<GOOD> Chat does this resemble any character you know
<GOOD> I'm trying to check if it's too obvious or not so far
<GOOD> I fucking love Sephiroth
<GOOD> Mmmm switch 2
<GOOD> Only 2 months away
<GOOD> I'm excited
<GOOD> Scug mentioned
<GOOD> Max karma saint vs Slenderman
<GOOD> listen to my voice and you'll find the key.
<GOOD> Yooo what is it
<GOOD> Actually I may have seen a little bit of that
<GOOD> I hate when games do that
<GOOD> You should beat this rlly cool mod called UCN Deluxe
<GOOD> When the Pursuit is Hopeless:
<GOOD> Gurt:
<GOOD> Bounty still has the rain world symbols in his name
<GOOD> It looks so forlorn
<GOOD> Why did I make the giant triangle of characters I like for literally no reason
<GOOD> It used up so much time for no reason
<GOOD> I don't hate enough characters to fill it out
<GOOD> I actually have an empty spot in this one because I can't think of another character I'd date
<GOOD> Que
<GOOD> Because she's near the top of the triangle
<GOOD> Arguably Junko is the least concerning of the individuals up there
<GOOD> I wouldn't look 1 character up if I were you
<GOOD> Jenova
<GOOD> Sephiroth's mom
<GOOD> Screams at you
<GOOD> She's an alien
<GOOD> And yeah she was kept in a pod
<GOOD> And then released when Sephiroth attacked Shinra
<GOOD> At least I think that's what happened iirc
<GOOD> I haven't yet
<GOOD> Also she's still someone I'd take on a date even if there's a high chance she would just tear me into pieces
<GOOD> Like all of the people in the top half of the triangle would kill me
<GOOD> I can see that point of view
<GOOD> I actually forgot that that was Tessa's skin
<GOOD> That's severely evil of the solver to do that
<GOOD> Thanks Google
<GOOD> The Mimi
<GOOD> Watching a 40 minute video about starving to death on Isle Delfino rn
<GOOD> Hi chat my character is confronting a representation of pure hatred and anger
<GOOD> (I might have them be redeemed but idk yet)
<GOOD> My stupid picky ass can't deal with the broth in ramen
<GOOD> It sucks because the ramen itself tastes lovely
<GOOD> I think at least idk I don't buy much ramen
<GOOD> I buy rice instead yummers
<GOOD> Making an OC but now I have to decide to maybe kill them
<GOOD> The anti furry flag is so edgy lmao
<GOOD> It reminds me of those weird Warhammer larpers
<GOOD> I don't think this is an apt comparison
<GOOD> +1
<GOOD> I won't +2 because I've seen a surprising amount of Katy Perry jokes recently
<GOOD> It's a dumb twitch chat thing
<GOOD> It came from Jerma's chat where entertained chatters said +2 to add time to a timer, and bored chatters could -2, and then it became twitch lingo for good take/joke
<GOOD> So now I just +2 random people
<GOOD> I only watch Northernlion
<GOOD> NOT 20 DOLAR
<GOOD> Northernlion is very funny
<GOOD> Rain world
<GOOD> Jenovah from FF7 is so pretty
<GOOD> I can't wait until I get pregnant and have a happy healthy child
<GOOD> Jk I don't want a kid
<GOOD> When I have a kid the second I leave the hospital I'm putting them on the mic in VC
<GOOD> I'm a freak
<GOOD> I'm a weiiirdooo
<GOOD> I'M A FREAK
<GOOD> Dipper what should I name my child
<GOOD> My baby
<GOOD> The J in DJ already stands for Jr
<GOOD> DJ 2 would be a kinda crazy name
<GOOD> How do you set a reminder a few months away
<GOOD> The suspiciously all-the-babies-in-the-hospital shaped lump in my throat
<GOOD> Baby eating respect button
<GOOD> Midnight is baby eating hours ig
<GOOD> We're boogeymaxxing
<GOOD> You don't know what DJ stands for
<GOOD> Also in that case it would be D the 3rd
<GOOD> Because you don't say Jr in that type of name
<GOOD> I haven't watched Lupin
<GOOD> I was doing to watch Lupin but they I didn't
<GOOD> I know who Lupin is I just watched Cowboy Bebop instead
<GOOD> Need a face design for my creature today I think
<GOOD> It's 9am
<GOOD> Anyway they need a face
<GOOD> I also need to trim my nails because I keep stimming
<GOOD> No, just red and blue
<GOOD> And then purple in the intersection of those colours
<GOOD> You don't want this character to be trans anyway they're evil
<GOOD> I know but it's not a rep you want
<GOOD> Legendary fyp pull as usual
<GOOD> Guys who wants to play Polybius
<GOOD> I wanna play another FF game tbh
<GOOD> Oh shit is that leopard seal (my OC reference)
<GOOD> Leopard seals are what I based my most serious OC off
<GOOD> Show
<GOOD> Very cute
<GOOD> I can't believe people thought the NS2 was gonna do poorly on release
<GOOD> I haven't read much of JJK, it failed to hook me
<GOOD> If a thing takes a while to get going or whatever I don't get interested in it
<GOOD> Master Wu
<GOOD> Very good
<GOOD> Won't stop what
<GOOD> Not for what I read
<GOOD> I only read up to like the first fight against Mahito which wasn't much but I wasn't interested by then so
<GOOD> I didn't like any character except Sukuna
<GOOD> My first anime as a kid was Pokmon, Inazuma Eleven and Ultimate Muscle
<GOOD> My first anime I ever watched online was Danganronpa
<GOOD> Oh yeah Digimon/Digimon Fusion too
<GOOD> I didn't like Demon Slayer much
<GOOD> I dropped it after Entertainment District
<GOOD> Because that was apparently the best arc and I was checked out
<GOOD> Hunter x Hunter is still one of the best shonen manga I've ever read
<GOOD> Yeah I didn't like how many second winds he got
<GOOD> It feels like a Regular Show fight scene where they just get hurt but don't actually get hurt at all
<GOOD> Both are fairly annoying
<GOOD> Demon Slayer has Zenitsu too
<GOOD> And Zenitsu is just awful
<GOOD> I said fairly annoying
<GOOD> And he is, I think Tanjiro is mildly annoying
<GOOD> He is a white bread protagonist
<GOOD> Which is fine usually
<GOOD> Tanjiro isn't him tho but that's ok
<GOOD> Why would you say that
<GOOD> The anime is weird about Nezuko anyway I don't like it
<GOOD> Yes Arcane is good
<GOOD> My favourite anime and manga is Delicious in Dungeon
<GOOD> Marvellous character writing
<GOOD> A level Four NAUGHTY LISTER?
<GOOD> I wanna replay Into the Pit
<GOOD> I love into the pit
<GOOD> Hello chat
<GOOD> I love ooey gooey characters
<GOOD> Hi char
<GOOD> My mom is messaging me about the Peppa Pig new baby
<GOOD> Kinda hype I'm ngl
<GOOD> Oh my goodness Kagurabachi is so peak
<GOOD> Lowkey Kagurabachi is probably gonna move up from my number 4 manga to number 3 if it stays the course here
<GOOD> The trailer for the latest one kinda annoyed me
<GOOD> Bc like you could tell me it was a trailer for Jurassic Park 2 and I'd believe you
<GOOD> Oh you're telling me there's another island and the dinosaurs are there too?
<GOOD> Me with my Terapagos-Terastal
<GOOD> Nothing afaik, except maybe Stellar itself if there's another tera stellar mon
<GOOD> It just doesn't overwrite any type
<GOOD> Imo stellar is a good gimmick
<GOOD> It's not intrusive and has a good niche
<GOOD> It also is super effective against tera mons and it isn't just first turn
<GOOD> It's for every move one time
<GOOD> Hiruhiko is such a fraud but I love him
<GOOD> That would be Scrafty
<GOOD> I love u Kagurabachi
<GOOD> I think the main character is no longer my favourite character in it
<GOOD> Killed by a swarm of locusts
<GOOD> Chat do you fw this guy so far
<GOOD> I FINISHED MY OC DRAWING RAAAAGH
<GOOD> I went over the top with layering
<GOOD> Boom I love it
<GOOD> Does soulslike in this situation include the FromSoft games BC I don't think they were trying to be too hard until like Elden Ring
<GOOD> Yeah I like them very much
<GOOD> I think Elden Ring is easy but it's also hard in the worst way possible
<GOOD> Like it fucks up the balance
<GOOD> Check logs
<GOOD> Monster Hunter is goated
<GOOD> I think people who did not enjoy MH gens 5 and 6 should play GU
<GOOD> Then if they don't like either that's fine
<GOOD> Depends on what game
<GOOD> Which one
<GOOD> Isn't Rise like rlly easy
<GOOD> I haven't played it because I played World and haven't gotten around to Rise, but Rise seems quite intuitive
<GOOD> This lmao my ass was Wiki'd out of my mind on GU
<GOOD> Play any gen 4 or below game you will understand why
<GOOD> Kill the Bullfango! Ok that's it that's all you get
<GOOD> Imo 4U has the best tutorials
<GOOD> Yeah because they got tired of it being a gatekept franchise
<GOOD> I'm a crazy gatekeeper for MH tho so
<GOOD> I have hundreds of hours in World and it's my least favourite of the ones I played
<GOOD> 4U and GU are awesome and I don't wanna play Wilds
<GOOD> Anyway everyone play Monster Hunter
<GOOD> Making my new OC actually unapologetically evil is making me feel bad
<GOOD> Like how do I put myself in the shoes of someone who wants to kill kids and shit they're angry asf
<GOOD> What would a hater do to the person they hate most except kill them and their entire family
<GOOD> Oh that's a good shout
<GOOD> I'm writing these down but also the last one is vague
<GOOD> And they definitely do wish to kill or at least replace the person they hate
<GOOD> I think I'm gonna make them blow up their house
<GOOD> And try to kill their kid
<GOOD> Mmm maybe maybe
<GOOD> Ohhh right I can also make them change them as a person so they're worse off for it
<GOOD> The social sabotage game is hard to play when you look like this
<GOOD> Like if this dude spread rumours I'd probably believe the other guy
<GOOD> Ohhhh that's awesome wtf
<GOOD> I wanna draw a character that looks this fucked up
<GOOD> This stare is insane
<GOOD> He's still my favourite character in the manga
<GOOD> Even if he's on fraudwatch
<GOOD> Huzz
<GOOD> I haven't decided if I wanna go out again rn
<GOOD> So sleepy
<GOOD> It's 10am
<GOOD> Thank you
<GOOD> I wanna make a new OC
<GOOD> Or at least finish my Kagurabachi OC
<GOOD> I wanna draw something cries and screams
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> As someone that has previously not been able to shower for a long period of time it won't kill you but it's very very bad for you anyhow
<GOOD> I need to give powers to a sword
<GOOD> I like tone tags
<GOOD> The single letters tend to stand for stuff
<GOOD> I wanna play Ultrakill again
<GOOD> Chat is this an outerversal powerscaling feat
<GOOD> I don't have a calc I can't do it
<GOOD> Calc is calculator for shirt chat
<GOOD> My calc shirt
<GOOD> Idk what Japanese thing to base my sword on
<GOOD> Might be a dragon idk
<GOOD> No, powers
<GOOD> God can y'all just drop it
<GOOD> You're all unfunny there solved
<GOOD> We love doodling on lined paper, I do it in class
<GOOD> The difference between my physical and digital is kinda noticeable lmfaoooo
<GOOD> Learn to deconstruct anatomy and draw basic shapes as literally the first thing you ever do, if you have the patience
<GOOD> Deconstruction is imo the most important skill in drawing
<GOOD> I haven't drawn my Kagurabachi OC yet but that's because I've been busy with another one
<GOOD> I now have 2 characters that are amorphous blobs
<GOOD> I have VEE and the one I sent earlier in chat
<GOOD> Ugh this is an old ref
<GOOD> I need to update refs but also make new refs
<GOOD> Jester mentioned, homing in
<GOOD> My other amorphous blob OC doesn't have a name yet
<GOOD> It's gonna be a baby eating murderer tho
<GOOD> Like this dude gonna be my most evil OC
<GOOD> Me listening to the mustard song on YouTube
<GOOD> Switch 2 only just over a month away
<GOOD> I wish people would inform themselves before talking about the Switch 2 cuz like 50% of the things I hear about it turn out false
<GOOD> It literally has >PS4 Pro power too afaik
<GOOD> And is a heavily optimised console anyway
<GOOD> Why does this matter again
<GOOD> Also what SD cards would they be
<GOOD> The Express cards aren't exclusive
<GOOD> I'm fairly sure on raw hardware it's better than Steam Deck which is good but also expected
<GOOD> I don't understand the problem, all consoles that existed in the last few decades have allowed extra storage to be bought
<GOOD> Have you ever bought extra storage for a PS4
<GOOD> Plus the base console has enough storage for like 10 or so optimised games
<GOOD> Do people just have collective amnesia about the entire games industry between 2010 and the Switch 2 Direct
<GOOD> This cover fucks
<GOOD> Since what
<GOOD> Imo it's a really really good shonen
<GOOD> I recommend picking it back up if you want to, it's actually about as popular as CSM was at the same point in its production
<GOOD> At least in terms of volumes sold
<GOOD> 2.2 million volumes sold so far
<GOOD> And the latest chapter is one of my favourites yet
<GOOD> Plus I love my favourite character in it
<GOOD> I wanna play something
<GOOD> But now I stimmed too hard so my entire body is burning up dies
<GOOD> I need to buy an ice pack tbh
<GOOD> I'm so warm I wish I didn't get this overhyped about OCs
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> I'm just imagining an OC almost killing another OC's child
<GOOD> I love imagining OC fight scenes
<GOOD> What does what mean
<GOOD> You didn't answer what you were talking about smh
<GOOD> Also I had vanilla and lavender iced latte today
<GOOD> Yum
<GOOD> I wanna cosplay Hiruhiko
<GOOD> Aren't insta reels like 50% people dying
<GOOD> Thinking about creepypastas rn
<GOOD> I don't think that's what English Lit is for
<GOOD> I love creepypastas
<GOOD> The recommended watch order is up to the end of Soul Society anime -> One Piece Fishman Island -> the rest of Bleach
<GOOD> Idk the arc order for Bleach or Naruto
<GOOD> I love Balatro
<GOOD> Why even bother using the effort for such poor bait
<GOOD> Like at least come up with something better
<GOOD> Nvm apparently it works
<GOOD> It's disappointing I put good effort into mine
<GOOD> The art form is dying
<GOOD> Watching any competent gameplay of Ultrakill makes me want to not play it
<GOOD> Do you only have to be alive at the end of it
<GOOD> Dragonball is just free tbh
<GOOD> My friend drew a new take on my OC and it became their real design letsgooooo
<GOOD> Do we fw them
<GOOD> They are incredibly evil we love them
<GOOD> My friend drew a gorgeous fullbody of them I love this character indeed
<GOOD> My friend made her take on my OC and it looks gorgeous but I can't replicate it
<GOOD> Screams
<GOOD> The music composer at HAL naming the Kirby song
<GOOD> Vagrant counting song of Retrospection
<GOOD> I need to practice drawing my OC again today
<GOOD> My friends' rendition vs mine is so aughhh
<GOOD> I drew a character yesterday and immediately traumatised them in a shitty doodle
<GOOD> I need to practice drawing this OC
<GOOD> I drew them yesterday but need to keep drawing them
<GOOD> Sure
<GOOD> It's pretty cool
<GOOD> I need to draw my new creature imitating different OCs
<GOOD> I wanna draw and work but I'm so tired
<GOOD> It's a process
<GOOD> I've only been drawing head shots of this OC so far
<GOOD> I would recommend choosing a shape (probably a cube) and then rotating it and maybe contorting it if you're confident
<GOOD> Drawing basic shapes is literally the best skill in art I'm not even joking
<GOOD> I wanna draw more of them they need a full design
<GOOD> Or at least my iteration of it
<GOOD> They don't have a species
<GOOD> They were trapped in the lab they were grown in as it was sabotaged, which in turn trapped them in a horrific pain-forever purgatory so when they broke out they were mad as hell
<GOOD> They actually look like this but they can cover themselves in calcified rock to look like the other form
<GOOD> Oh, I mean kinda
<GOOD> They can do the Eren hardening thing after all
<GOOD> I read things
<GOOD> Drawing angst on a Whiteboard rn
<GOOD> Hai chat
<GOOD> I'm drawing angst
<GOOD> Making a character into a hater is very fun
<GOOD> My goat streamer has a 2 hour misogyny supercut   /lh
<GOOD> What do you mean the PS6 release is being rumoured already
<GOOD> We still got no games like unironically what the fuck
<GOOD> This is the worst console gen ever I think
<GOOD> Yeah but that means the PS5 is already in its autumn years
<GOOD> MORE OC DRAWINGS
<GOOD> YEAHHHHHH MORE OC DOODLES
<GOOD> Gargoyles can move tho
<GOOD> I love drawing this thing
<GOOD> I would beat a gorilla in a fight I think
<GOOD> A gorilla's bones are too dense
<GOOD> Joe many liberals does it take to change a log by bolb
<GOOD> I love drawing this OC's head over and over and over again
<GOOD> I wanna go to Transylvania one time tbh
<GOOD> Lmao
<GOOD> Hello chat
<GOOD> I love doodling
<GOOD> I love this creature so much
<GOOD> Idk why the gorilla thing is so debated
<GOOD> The gorilla would probably die even if the humans just stood perfectly still
<GOOD> 2 MONTHS RAAAA
<GOOD> I'm so excited
<GOOD> We DKmaxxing in this chat
<GOOD> This shit is so heat
<GOOD> HELL YEAH DID WE GET A PREVIEW
<GOOD> Also that image is Felix the Shark right
<GOOD> What story is this meant to be then
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> The story is gonna be In the Flesh
<GOOD> I need this
<GOOD> Evening
<GOOD> The 30 billion and 1st SpongeBob, the gorilla and the last human teaming up against the 1 billion lions
<GOOD> I'm ngl I still don't know if a gorilla could beat a bear
<GOOD> I think I'm biased towards bears
<GOOD> Thank you Chaos I know I'm eloquent
<GOOD> What about Dracula
<GOOD> I think a gorilla could beat Dracula
<GOOD> Ok fine, I think a hippo fucks up a bear tho
<GOOD> Hippos are one of the few animals I'm scared of
<GOOD> I'm not scared of many animals
<GOOD> I'm scared of literally 0 things in the ocean and that's already like, a massive amount of all animals on Earth
<GOOD> Hippos, wolf spiders
<GOOD> I don't really know what else
<GOOD> This is an odd question
<GOOD> Like I'm not scared of sharks, I'm scared of being eaten
<GOOD> And lowkey if I was next to a great white I wouldn't be that freaked out
<GOOD> They're kinda chill
<GOOD> You're more statistically likely to be killed by a vending machine than a shark apparently
<GOOD> I mean my survival instincts are kicking in by not being a fucking idiot and punching a tiger
<GOOD> Like would you be scared if a mountain lion was angry at you? Like yes
<GOOD> Oh actually I'm also scared of chimps they're on the list too
<GOOD> That feels like a fallacy
<GOOD> Like I'm not scared of vending machines
What if the vending machine was on top of you and made of fire and about to explode and it boiled your skin off and dispensed lava and you can't move????? What about then????
<GOOD> Erm, answer the question
<GOOD> My point is that anything that poses a probable threat of killing you should unnerve you
<GOOD> But I'm not scared of forks because I might slip and die on it
<GOOD> I'm not scared of windows because I might fall out of it
<GOOD> And by extension I'm not scared of lions because it's not like I'm ever going to be in a situation in which one is pulling my intestines out
<GOOD> I think you could make up a billion situations to make me afraid of any hypothetical, but in most cases I'm not afraid of an animal
<GOOD> Like I'm not afraid of a lion, but if I were in a situation where my head were in its mouth my fear of injury and death would say hey watch out
<GOOD> But I'm not gonna be in that situation, and in most situations like that I would still say no to things like a shark
<GOOD> If I were in a situation where I were out in the wilderness in lion infested woods I'd bring a gun or smth
<GOOD> Not like I could shoot something anyway
<GOOD> My idea of being afraid of an animal is that I can't even see them in an enclosure or over a picture without being scared
<GOOD> I cannot watch a video of a hippo, or see a wolf spider or chimp without being scared
<GOOD> Although chimps sometimes don't scare me as much
<GOOD> I can look at them, I just get irked looking at them
<GOOD> Especially this
<GOOD> Like look at this monster
<GOOD> Disgusting
<GOOD> Horrible creature
<GOOD> Ye
<GOOD> They can crush animals in their mouth too
<GOOD> They feel like machines
<GOOD> It's unnatural
<GOOD> Anyway I think if a gorilla couldn't beat Dracula, a bear absolutely would
<GOOD> Brown bear I should say bc a black bear gets boxed by a human
<GOOD> I could beat a grizzly bear but I'm not a man so that bear is lucky
<GOOD> Even assuming the gorilla fights it's just gonna get tired
<GOOD> No I'm saying if the humans literally just stood around and let themselves get ripped apart, it would get tired
<GOOD> Monkeys get tired very fast compared to humans
<GOOD> They're not made for marathons they're sprinters
<GOOD> Like 6 imo
<GOOD> How many gorillas would it take to beat Dracula
<GOOD> I honestly don't buy it
<GOOD> Like a stake through the heart but what if they just crushed them under their giant monkey fists
<GOOD> Would they come back from a formless pile of viscera
<GOOD> 4 gorillas, 2 hippos and 20 black bears vs 100 humans
<GOOD> 1 billion lions vs The 1 Gorilla, the 30,000,000,001st SpongeBob and the 100th Man
<GOOD> Yeah but that man and that SpongeBob beat a gorilla and Goku respectively
<GOOD> Ok but real talk do you think a stake through the heart is fr the only way to kill a vampire like surely if you crushed his heart that would work
<GOOD> I think the wooden stake is the only feasible way a human could tho
<GOOD> But like Bram Stoker's Dracula is kinda bitchmade
<GOOD> I know it's an unpopular opinion but I think Bigfoot beats Dracula by using a tree log as a stake
<GOOD> 30 men on cocaine, 20 on heroin and 50 smoked a blunt before the fight vs 5 gorillas on cocaine, 30 lemurs on Adderall and 25 polar bears with bombs strapped to their body
<GOOD> The gorilla hypothetical gains a new permutation
<GOOD> No that's too much they're trained
<GOOD> The polar bears just explode
<GOOD> What if the 100 men and the gorilla just smoked weed together instead
<GOOD> It's interesting how people will say 100 men is a lot of men, but when I say a billion lions is a lot of lions people say I'm wrong
<GOOD> My toxic trait is that I do unironically think the lions win
<GOOD> Saving them for remakes tbh
<GOOD> They don't really care
<GOOD> People would do that even if it was readily available
<GOOD> Mario 64 was on N64 NSO and you know my ass is on the PC port
<GOOD> Are we forgetting that this has already been a standard for ages atp
<GOOD> Like digital physical games have already been a thing
<GOOD> Only ones where the 3rd party devs can't make it like 50GB
<GOOD> It's not Nintendo's job and it takes up shelf space
<GOOD> Advertising a game in person is more important to them imo which is understandable
<GOOD> Selling the game physically is the solution
<GOOD> I'm ngl I'm apathetic about either side of this but the people that constantly boast about emulating and hacking your 3DS and hardmodding are annoying
<GOOD> Not just like I emulate tho
<GOOD> This also goes for every lane of piracy
<GOOD> I DON'T CARE I KNOW I KNOW I'M GOING TO TEAR YOUR LIMBS OFF
<GOOD> Ok some of us said things we regret
<GOOD> I didn't mean to make it a reference
<GOOD> It was a threat
<GOOD> I mean you might not die if I tore your limbs off
<GOOD> Does anyone else really like that one YOOOOOOOOO sound effect
<GOOD> Slenderman Vs Bigfoot
<GOOD> I keep getting one specific video game rap battle on my tiktok page what gives
<GOOD> Bob omb vs Creeper which makes it even more confusing
<GOOD> Waiiiiiit this shit heat /j
<GOOD> NEVERMIND THAT VERSE WAS KINDA HOT
<GOOD> Please don't let character rap battles become a guilty pleasure of mine I already have too many guilty pleasures
<GOOD> I ignored rap battles for this long don't let them get me Vill
<GOOD> I don't know
<GOOD> Saw a Ben Drowned video and expected screaming immediately as I opened it
<GOOD> Cool
<GOOD> I've been doodling all day tbh this new character fucks
<GOOD> Big fan of their various impressions
<GOOD> I don't like him
<GOOD> Idrc about Satanism I'm ngl, I subscribe to no beliefs in particular but apparently they align with Buddhism
<GOOD> It's a genchat, I do not care
<GOOD> I used to try and pray when I was young but it didn't work and I didn't vibe with it
<GOOD> Moves that you can angle in plat fighters are so awesome
<GOOD> Someone asked every Yu-Gi-Oh monster vs every Pokmon
<GOOD> YGO monsters mog so far
<GOOD> Easily
<GOOD> I only have like 5 more Balatro decks left to gold stake
<GOOD> Idk what I'm even looking forward to tbh
<GOOD> I think Switch 2 is the only thing I'm looking forward to
<GOOD> Yeah I'm saving it for now
<GOOD> Currently grinding up red deck stakes
<GOOD> I forgot about that movie
<GOOD> I got excited when I heard Doom was in the movie, then heard RDJ was playing him and then never heard about the movie again
<GOOD> It's like top 2 decks
<GOOD> I just think there was a better option than RDJ
<GOOD> Like there's so many actors out there
<GOOD> I usually don't have a huge opinion on the casting of a movie, but it's the characters that played the various characters in their other movies
<GOOD> Which is to be expected
<GOOD> Like if you tell me the actor for Thor is in the next movie I'll be like yeah that makes sense
<GOOD> I'm also a bit apathetic to the whole everyone is here thing over the last few years
<GOOD> I think that things can stay separate for a while
<GOOD> Maybe that's just bc I'm not a Marvel fan tho
<GOOD> Like I'm not popping off for Professor X or Gambit
<GOOD> Also why was RDJ in the chair at the end of the trailer
<GOOD> Ykw I'm not gonna be a hater about this
<GOOD> It's just perplexing ig
<GOOD> RDJ being the main selling point is not a vote of confidence for me
<GOOD> I don't dislike him but it's like, I don't care who's in a movie
<GOOD> I care about how good the movie is or how interesting the concept is
<GOOD> I'm sorry but I'm kinda apathetic to it
<GOOD> That's somewhat interesting
<GOOD> Although NWH already kinda had the universes colliding thing
<GOOD> But I liked that movie so
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> I think I'm still unfortunately on my MCU tiredness
<GOOD> Or maybe I won't ever get it back idk
<GOOD> But like when ppl are like oh it's another multiverse crossover plot with 4 new comic characters introduced I'm usually like, that's neat ig, enjoy
<GOOD> I do not want to watch every Marvel movie ever produced, but isn't this Avengers movie Doom's MCU debut
<GOOD> Also I was more referring to like, omg Modok is in this movie????? Gambit was in this??? The Thunderbolts has like 5 new characters that I've never heard of?
<GOOD> I feel like a lot of the excitement is lost on me
<GOOD> I wonder why they aren't memorable in the slightest
<GOOD> I watched falcon and the winter soldier and half of Hawkeye
<GOOD> And I watched all 3 Ant Mans and only remember the first one
<GOOD> Yeah I remember that
<GOOD> It was pretty poignant but it was neat
<GOOD> It's like one of the only scenes from the series I remember
<GOOD> Because I started getting very very bored
<GOOD> How many seasons did it have
<GOOD> I watched like a season and a half I think and don't remember it
<GOOD> I actually watched it weekly with my mom as it came out so I wouldn't guess baselessly
<GOOD> Every episode
<GOOD> Yeah in my own time
<GOOD> Also I've been consuming FNaF every day for 10 years I don't get tired of it
<GOOD> That's what I've done for the last 3 years or so yeah
<GOOD> I don't watch MCU movies anymore
<GOOD> So when people are like are you excited for red hulk I usually say no
<GOOD> Or when people are like RDJ is in this movie I'm like I hope that's not all it has to swing around
<GOOD> This poster looks like an Amazon Prime original
<GOOD> I'm willing to hear it out because I don't care about who's in a movie, but a lot of MCU marketing is just who's in the movie so I wasn't that excited anyway
<GOOD> Like I (usually) don't care what characters are in it, nor do I care about the cast
<GOOD> Maybe the MCU was never for me that's ok
<GOOD> It's a poster
<GOOD> Why is there an asterisk
<GOOD> Why would I watch the movie
<GOOD> I'm ngl I don't blame people for not watching like 30 MCU movies and the 3 connecting series
<GOOD> Like if I'm like I don't care about Red Hulk then I get welllll clearly you haven't watched Patriot vs the Scringler, a Disney+ exclusive series
<GOOD> Like no I don't care because the movie hasn't interested me in any like, base sense
<GOOD> However if they put Godzilla in that shit I'm gonna watch it
<GOOD> Pretending I care about Modok
<GOOD> What is BNW
<GOOD> Oh that's what that was called
<GOOD> But yea it's just like, I don't think it's even a superhero issue
<GOOD> I watched the Superman trailer and was like HOLY SHIT
<GOOD> I wanna watch that one
<GOOD> I don't even like Superman that much but that trailer was good
<GOOD> I'm not invested in superheroes I just think it'll be pretty good so I'll watch
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Trying to talk about GvK without sounding like a hater is painful
<GOOD> Or at least the newest one
<GOOD> The others were p good
<GOOD> Everyone here watch Minus One
<GOOD> I am a hypocrite tho because I kinda popped off when that new Kirby game said Sakurai was working on it
<GOOD> Like hell yeah hi Sakurai
<GOOD> Also you will never get me to watch Invincible or The Boys
<GOOD> I do not know why but Invincible straight up doesn't interest me
<GOOD> Every single one of my friends is interested and has been telling me to watch it and I've just been like
<GOOD> Idk about serving cunt bc I just say serving
<GOOD> Serving cunt = slaying
<GOOD> Or whatever
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> Who buying the banban youtooz
<GOOD> when are you reading Kagurabachi
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah read that
<GOOD> CSM is like equal to Kagurabachi in my rankings
<GOOD> It goes Dunmeshi >CSM = Kagurabachi = Dandadan
<GOOD> Kagurabachi has my baby too
<GOOD> Hokozano is a crazy good artist usually tbh
<GOOD> I like this panel it's funny but makes me nervous
<GOOD> But yea CSM is awesome too, in my top 3 manga
<GOOD> Matpat likes FNaF I don't trust him
<GOOD> When is Creepypasta the movie
<GOOD> Creepypasta cinematic universe
<GOOD> On everybody's soul we're gonna watch the Ben Drowned movie
<GOOD> They're so fucked when Springtrap shows up
<GOOD> Green Goblin being consumed by Eleanor and a wave of black sludge
<GOOD> I truly am past my time
<GOOD> I must continue the creepypasta and horror indie bloodline
<GOOD> Maybe I should have kids and tell them campfire stories about Jeff the Killer
<GOOD> At least people still fw Sonic.exe
<GOOD> I am Sonic.exe
I was brought to life on an evil CD
<GOOD> Also was Jeff the land shark a real thing before marvel rivals
<GOOD> Those movies have a universe?
<GOOD> Oh I've only watched the nun
<GOOD> I still need to binge Scream
<GOOD> I love slasher movies
<GOOD> Scream 1 is hysterical so I need to see the rest
<GOOD> Ghostface is my favourite slasher villain
<GOOD> I love campy slasher movies
<GOOD> I didn't like it as much at all
<GOOD> The camp is part of the fun
<GOOD> They kick Ghostface down a flight of stairs like 3 times in the first Scream movie
<GOOD> He's so incompetent it's awesome
<GOOD> Nightmare on Elm Street is funny too
<GOOD> The protagonist tackles Freddy down the stairs
<GOOD> Yeah, slasher doesn't fall into real horror as much anymore
<GOOD> Scream isn't scary but it's sure as hell funny with random jumpy parts
<GOOD> Same as Final Destination
<GOOD> I agree, I'm not much of a splatter movie person
<GOOD> That's why I don't wanna watch Terrifier, it seems like it's trying too hard
<GOOD> Oh yeah Halloween is also rlly funny
<GOOD> 50 minutes of is this dude gonna do anything except stand in their garden /pos
<GOOD> Neat
<GOOD> I won't watch Saw either
<GOOD> Youtube autoplay what are you doing
<GOOD> I can see the vision but it's just eh
<GOOD> This dude is so funny
<GOOD> Yeah he isn't
<GOOD> Ok this one is funny because they just straight up don't see him
<GOOD> And act like she's crazy for seeing it
<GOOD> I'm not jaded I unironically love slashers
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I don't wanna watch I Saw the TV Glow in case it fucks me up
<GOOD> Psychological Horror movie about being closeted
<GOOD> At least from what I've heard
<GOOD> Because I'm closeted
<GOOD> I'm saying I don't want to watch it because it'll cut too deep
<GOOD> I watch movies and play games as escapism
<GOOD> Not the same at all but I also won't watch Skinamarink because that would make me unable to sleep comfortably
<GOOD> I do not like Intruder horror, it's deeply unsettling to me
<GOOD> And I hallucinate when I'm afraid/stressed so not for me
<GOOD> I much prefer campy horror for that reason
<GOOD> Queer people in MY horror movies? More likely than you think!
<GOOD> It's not visual hallucination but it's like hearing sounds that most likely just don't exist
<GOOD> And feeling sensations like being tugged on
<GOOD> I'm not schizophrenic
<GOOD> Google exploding head syndrome because that happens too sometimes
<GOOD> That's something that can happen to anyone tho so
<GOOD> Do you know what exploding head syndrome is bounty
<GOOD> It's random incredibly loud audio hallucinations, usually as you're falling asleep
<GOOD> Last time for me it was the sound of a human growling like a dog right in front of my face
<GOOD> No, like a gunshot
<GOOD> A real noise that you think is real
<GOOD> But yea I'm not schizophrenic but I do experience hallucinations whilst stressed
<GOOD> And my brain runs fast which causes me to become frantic
<GOOD> I'm trying to be genuine
<GOOD> I've become significantly more chilled out once I started working on myself but I still occasionally have episodes
<GOOD> Eventually the pendulum swings back from being stressed to being free and then I straight up have manic episodes where I'll almost run in front of cars with basically no care for it and become wildly impulsive
<GOOD> Stress is a slow insidious killer
<GOOD> So I remain chill
<GOOD> I mean I don't do it much anymore but I'm still tightly wound
<GOOD> I like being straight up with people and yapping for as long as possible
<GOOD> But then that turns into ranting and people think that me saying what I think matter of factly is hate for what I'm talking about
<GOOD> I wanted to rant yesterday about prophecy tropes in media tbh
<GOOD> That's good
<GOOD> Tends to come off as abrasive
<GOOD> Anyway please don't let me get roped into video game rap battles I've dodged this trend for over a decade
<GOOD> I watched Creeper vs Bob omb rap battle as a joke
<GOOD> I have not played this game
<GOOD> But my rant was actually about the handling of subversions
<GOOD> I actually don't like when prophecies are straight up false or have a 99% chance or whatever
<GOOD> I actually like when prophecies are fulfilled, and I like subversions when the subversion is reinterpreting the meaning of it
<GOOD> One of them, I read Skulduggery Pleasant as a kid instead
<GOOD> And Beast Quest
<GOOD> I haven't watched those movies but that seems like the case
<GOOD> Maybe, I just don't have time tbh
<GOOD> I've been getting into too many RPGs, they're soaking up all my time
<GOOD> Trying Dragon Quest and FF next
<GOOD> But yea I don't mind generic JRPG the hero will destroy the villain when the villain rises prophecies being fulfilled, but I also like Oingo Boingo style prophecies where the prophecy is fulfilled, but the interpretation is twisted
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> Have you played Chrono Trigger that kinda has one
<GOOD> I haven't played FF1 yet, only 7
<GOOD> I quite like JRPGs that have stamina meters
<GOOD> I don't know the name for the battle system
<GOOD> Like FF7
<GOOD> It adds a real time element without making everything too frantic
<GOOD> I also need to continue FE Fates actually I was gonna do that today
<GOOD> Also daisy-chaining rants, but I hate the genre RPG
<GOOD> RPG is a bad genre category imo
<GOOD> It's too vague of an idea
<GOOD> Pikmin 4 has stats, upgrades and was made in Japan
<GOOD> And you roleplay as Captain Olimar
<GOOD> Yeah I tried a few hours of XC
<GOOD> It wasn't as interesting to me
<GOOD> PLAY FIRE EMBLEM PLAY FIRE EMBLEM PL
<GOOD> Wait Chaos have you seen the one Fire Emblem Power Rangers video
<GOOD> Banger song
<GOOD> This is the official intro to the game
<GOOD> They didn't do this in any other game for some reason
<GOOD> It's so cheesy I love it
<GOOD> EMBLEM, ENGAGE
<GOOD> FE Awakening tackles straight up genocide
<GOOD> And like every FE game tackles racism and nationalism
<GOOD> ~~they can't put gay people in tho they lack the technology~~
<GOOD> I think Engage added gay people idk
<GOOD> I've only played FE7 and Awakening
<GOOD> I wanna play Fates and then ignore the story
<GOOD> It's funny
<GOOD> I think there's also dubstep mole people or something in one of the games
<GOOD> Dw they said Emblem Engage
<GOOD> I wish Fire Emblem games weren't weird about women
<GOOD> I picked female Robin in Awakening and accidentally romanced Chrom
<GOOD> Chrom walked in on me naked and I was just sitting there like man what the fuck
<GOOD> Of course
<GOOD> It's a JRPG
<GOOD> I'm so vanilla but it might be FF7 for me lmaoooo
<GOOD> For Action RPGs it's MHGU
<GOOD> I love MHGU so much
<GOOD> You can QoL patch it and it becomes significantly nicer tbhtbh
<GOOD> I'm gonna say something forbidden here, but mods are really really good, even for first playthrough
<GOOD> I modded FF7 for my first playthrough and didn't regret it at all
<GOOD> I added exp share and stuff
<GOOD> And some upgraded portraits etc
<GOOD> And animations
<GOOD> And textures and cutscenes
<GOOD> It was like a huge overhaul and I loved it
<GOOD> Same for SA2 tbh I put a few mods on that thing tbh
<GOOD> SA2 Steam port needs fixing tho
<GOOD> So mods are understandable
<GOOD> Basically every single Sonic game is drastically improved by some random overhaul mod on GameBanana
<GOOD> It's awesome
<GOOD> I have great news because like 80% of the characters are the same
<GOOD> I'm buying Deltarune on my Switch 2 on release day and playing chapters 3 and 4 tbh
<GOOD> I've drawn like 8 headshots of this character in 2 days in addicted
<GOOD> I love making OCs I like
<GOOD> I will also be maining Pianta day 1
<GOOD> I love Piantas sm
<GOOD> I had to spend like a week polishing their design and I'm still doing it
<GOOD> I have even more of these random doodles
<GOOD> They aren't finished yet
<GOOD> Not really
<GOOD> I was inspired by Fecto Elfilis from Kirby a bit
<GOOD> Chess with PvP roguelike buffs
<GOOD> Is everyone enjoying Silksong
<GOOD> I like Silksong so far but why is there this giant unremovable step counter on my screen
<GOOD> Kinda takes away my immersion
<GOOD> Hi chat it's fire emblem time
<GOOD> I don't like most of my fandoms aaaaaaaagh
<GOOD> Oh waow Xbox raising game prices
<GOOD> But I heard that Nintendo setting the industry standard was just them and the other companies would never
<GOOD> PS5 controllers aren't made for playing games
<GOOD> My dog is 10 now
<GOOD> I hate doomscrolling can hopescrolling exist instead
<GOOD> I would not do the math to say she's 10 in dog years
<GOOD> Doesn't help when everything feels very much real
<GOOD> Like I want some real hope to exist this planet is ass
<GOOD> Based on this dry ass response I think you could do with it more than me wtf is your problem
<GOOD> I wasn't trying to have an issue with you don't treat me like a 5 year old
<GOOD> It feels like crock recently
<GOOD> Although I won't harsh on anyone for believing it, I would if I could
<GOOD> There are a few like this
<GOOD> I'm fairly there's one about a demon lord doing a 9 to 5
<GOOD> Yeah think so
<GOOD> Fire emblem is so cool
<GOOD> Maybe it takes a while to set up
<GOOD> Also tbhtbh I wouldn't fully suspect cheating immediately but that's me
<GOOD> Chat my fire emblem save is bugged
<GOOD> The perfect IV thing is only in some gens
<GOOD> In gen 9 you can just manufacture IVs
<GOOD> Love is awesome but confusing there solved
<GOOD> Why does Sharpedo have Rough Skin if shark skin is smooth to touch
<GOOD> I miss him so much
<GOOD> Come back to me Sojo
<GOOD> So is anyone playing Silksong rn
<GOOD> It's pretty good
<GOOD> Yesterday
<GOOD> It's really annoying tho BC I can't close this weird fitness window?
<GOOD> Like it's taking up so much space
<GOOD> I'm wing gaster, the royal scientist!
<GOOD> How it feels to love a manga that doesn't have an anime
<GOOD> Can she cook me a surf n turf
<GOOD> I feel like surf n turf rn
<GOOD> I have a craving rn
<GOOD> I would never be gay
<GOOD> I don't know if I can be gay
<GOOD> I don't have a gender so
<GOOD> I just say I'm sapphic because it fits more
<GOOD> I'm indifferent
<GOOD> I am the chosen one
<GOOD> I'm so lightheaded
<GOOD> I still have a sour opinion of them because they're trend pets
<GOOD> Who wants to hold the tungsten cube
<GOOD> Why is he imitating goat
<GOOD> Somehow not the biggest aura farmer in the manga
<GOOD> Spot
<GOOD> Fuuuck I think I have too much caffeine in the tank
<GOOD> I feel sick and shaky
<GOOD> I don't think a game being relevant makes it the best
<GOOD> You were just talking about OoT
<GOOD> We're arguing in glass houses I think
<GOOD> The remake is over a decade old
<GOOD> Banjo-Kazooie is my favourite N64 game tbh
<GOOD> I don't think a game being irrelevant necessarily makes it bad
<GOOD> Hidden gems exist for a reason
<GOOD> I don't know what my favourite game is tbh
<GOOD> I similarly don't think that something being widely considered the best doesn't make it the best
<GOOD> People think Elden Ring is the best Souls game and I disagree a lot
<GOOD> And I don't doubt it, but the best game of *all time* is very difficult to achieve
<GOOD> Imo the best game of all time is functionally perfect in almost every way
<GOOD> I agree
<GOOD> I'm just saying some things hold me back from saying any N64 game is the greatest game of all time
<GOOD> Games being dated is a genuine issue to me
<GOOD> Idk even like, Mario 64 has jank
<GOOD> True but Banjo-Kazooie isn't immune to the dating
<GOOD> That one fuckass window jiggy in Rusty Bucket Bay
<GOOD> Every time I try OoT I play it for about an hour and 30 minutes
<GOOD> I enjoyed Grunty's Furnace Fun tbh
<GOOD> I haven't played Tooie yet
<GOOD> I didn't respond to this but I think the final third of the game is severely fucked up
<GOOD> Gameplay
<GOOD> Also a lot of the boss and enemy design feels a bit forced
<GOOD> Yeah, a lot of the bosses don't seem to have as much flow to me
<GOOD> Elden Ring has a weird delay issue
<GOOD> It wasn't very hard
<GOOD> I don't care about the gatekeepy Souls bullshit
<GOOD> But the bosses don't feel as good to fight
<GOOD> Even the very first boss Margit has the weird delays
<GOOD> Like they have 3 straight seconds of windup to a swing and it's like guh
<GOOD> And the DLC feels straight up wrong
<GOOD> Because it feels like From was leaning too much into being difficult on purpose
<GOOD> I'm excited to main Pianta day 1
<GOOD> Me (last person standing) rage boosted and avenging the other 99 people that fought the gorilla
<GOOD> I love my mom bro she's so cool
<GOOD> Chat.... Is anyone alive... The gorilla took out so many of us...
<GOOD> Someone is arguing on the side of the gorilla rn
<GOOD> Good evening
<GOOD> I'm playing Fire Emblem
<GOOD> Fates
<GOOD> Gameplay wise yeah
<GOOD> The story feels a bit bland but not awful
<GOOD> I have only played FE7 and Awakening before this
<GOOD> And I prefer newer Fire Emblem even if 7 was good asf
<GOOD> We should start making good games
<GOOD> I would beat the gorilla
<GOOD> Send
<GOOD> How did you find this
<GOOD> Also the gorilla wins bait is immaculate
<GOOD> 100 humans is a lot of humans
<GOOD> Dipper... The other 98 humans are gone....
<GOOD> We need to team up
<GOOD> The 97th human revealing themselves to still be alive jumping the gorilla
<GOOD> Me (the 100th human) after a rage boost from seeing my 99 friends dead
<GOOD> WE HUMANS HAVE NO LIMITS
<GOOD> Bigfoot vs Great King of Evil Ganondorf
<GOOD> Me and the gorilla in our final confrontation (we allowed ourselves an honourable duel with weapons)
<GOOD> MORE FIRE EMBLEM
<GOOD> Has the game merged with Chinese servers yet
<GOOD> Nobody could have predicted other console companies doing the exact same thing as Nintendo
<GOOD> Not in a million years
<GOOD> Yaaaa Switch 2 in like a month
<GOOD> I'm so excited to play it
<GOOD> Gay switch 2
<GOOD> Anyone else been quitting more games before they finish them recently
<GOOD> I'm ngl I've become way less tolerant of games that piss me off
<GOOD> Like if the game pisses me off I just stop playing it and it works
<GOOD> I need to finish Bayo before I play DMCV
<GOOD> I can see that angle
<GOOD> It mostly occurred to me because I said to a friend dw if this Fire Emblem game annoys me or is too hard I'll just stop playing it and it occurred to me that I didn't used to be like that
<GOOD> Oh I did stop playing that one lol, I got lost
<GOOD> I do like when stuff like that happens, like a storybook containing everything or smth
<GOOD> What if you made another
<GOOD> Someone idk
<GOOD> That shit probably a replicable experiment
<GOOD> This is scaring me
<GOOD> That's not Kirby which is why I'm scared
<GOOD> I'm like 70% done
<GOOD> Evening
<GOOD> YEAAHHHHHH I FOUND HIM IN ASDA
<GOOD> Stimming rn
<GOOD> He's just bad at expressing how happy he is
<GOOD> Chat do things float in water when you fill the water with detergent
<GOOD> OC design is hard
<GOOD> Me and bestie are finally trying to design a character we've had for months, but haven't been able to actually make
<GOOD> Like we need to flesh them out and give them a real design
<GOOD> Samurott doesn't look much like a sea lion
<GOOD> Honestly Samurott's face reminds me more of a rat than any marine mammal
<GOOD> He has a master Splinter vibe going on
<GOOD> That's Sensei Wu
<GOOD> I'm trying to find a tiny tube for my Shadow figure and a little LED but I can't find any aaaa
<GOOD> Too big
<GOOD> He's like 2 inches tall I think
<GOOD> I found this and it looks good
<GOOD> I don't know inches ok
<GOOD> Lemme measure him
<GOOD> Ok he's 2 and a half inches
<GOOD> The whole Samurott line is based on otters and sea shells
<GOOD> Yeah Razor Shell is based on otters cracking clams open
<GOOD> I mean yeah it's generic marine mammal inspo
<GOOD> Samurott is partly otter but he's not all otter
<GOOD> Also on this note I kinda hate his little tail
<GOOD> Pikachu is meant to be a mouse btw
<GOOD> I like alolan raichu
<GOOD> Also I'm trying to get my irl bestie onto Kagurabachi
<GOOD> She asked what it was when I showed her a panel and I shrieked
<GOOD> We Bachiing
<GOOD> We. Kagura. Bachi.
<GOOD> I don't think otter to seal-otter is that much of a jump tbh
<GOOD> What the fuuuck there was a limited edition?
<GOOD> Aw damn I'm jealous
<GOOD> The final evo kinda goes crazy
<GOOD> I heard you guys hate pinnipedal evos
<GOOD> I need to start buying the Bachi volumes
<GOOD> Every time I go to a store they only have the most recent volume
<GOOD> Like WHYYYYYY GIVE ME VOLUME 1
<GOOD> This was taken in a book store 

This mf presumes
<GOOD> Glazing Kagurabachi again but it might have my favourite shonen first arc
<GOOD> Like ever, it's already my favourite shonen rn but damn
<GOOD> Incin my goat
<GOOD> I mean Incin is still a cat
<GOOD> Cement them
<GOOD> CEMENT CEMENT CEMENT
<GOOD> I think Torracat is a good bridge to Incin tbh
<GOOD> Although the job animal bit is funny with starters
<GOOD> Incin should have been built like demon Bendy is what you're saying
<GOOD> I don't know many FNaF characters with disproportionately long arms
<GOOD> You need to expand your repertoire
<GOOD> Speaking of leaks did anyone else think the Smash Grinch leak meant people thought the Grinch was getting added to Smash
<GOOD> If I see a Switch 2 edition of SSBU and that battlefield ice starts cracking bro....
<GOOD> Yes but this was a different thing
<GOOD> The leak was somewhat reputable
<GOOD> How Primarina would feel evolving into a samurai
<GOOD> *Brionne
<GOOD> Also you can bash Samurott but hop off Primarina
<GOOD> She's like the best starter ever except Chesnaught imo
<GOOD> Because marine mammals like sea lions is where mermaid legends came from
<GOOD> Plus same body type
<GOOD> Still makes sense to me
<GOOD> Popplio isn't really anything lol, same as most first stage starters
<GOOD> Non-woke male Primarina frfr
<GOOD> See I was gonna say lesbian but I was treading on dangerous ground
<GOOD> Also the spikes are killing me
<GOOD> That one Pal world design
<GOOD> What, the fan design?
<GOOD> It looks like nothing rlly
<GOOD> I would say this looks pretty masculine, why aren't they all men
<GOOD> *they, and it's a species so idc
<GOOD> I know that it's a male silverback
<GOOD> Primarina is 85% male right like the other guys
<GOOD> THE BOYYYYSSSS
<GOOD> I like the 2 that aren't Decidueye
<GOOD> I like the Vaporeon design as a general design
<GOOD> I love 5 minute doodles
<GOOD> I need to finish drawings less so I can draw this shit more fr
<GOOD> I'm so scared to try and design this character
<GOOD> Can you guys tell me some cool old dudes from anime
<GOOD> Middle aged also counts as long as they look old
<GOOD> Sarutobi's face reminds me of Avatar for some reason
<GOOD> It might be the artstyle
<GOOD> Sea salt
<GOOD> I still haven't even started Invincible idk what's next on my to watch list
<GOOD> I think you need to have a word with your server's owner
<GOOD> All of my moodboard characters are like 20 and this is meant to be for a character that's like 30+
<GOOD> Some peoples' favourite franchise is Pokmon, heartbreaking
<GOOD> Dashing through the foliage, my axe finds another tree to fell
<GOOD> I spent one hour having a fake deep discussion about AI sentience with a random c.ai bot 2 years ago then never used it again
<GOOD> Chat this dude is me
<GOOD> I'm always referring to my dark sinister aura
<GOOD> Jeff the Killer is so awesome
<GOOD> He stopped someone's heart with a single punch
<GOOD> The teeth thing about Britain always confused me
<GOOD> I don't smoke and my teeth are mildly yellowed from childhood, but tbh I heard complete whiteness isn't as natural which makes sense
<GOOD> My little moodboard for a character only has 4 fucking images I really don't know what to do with this dude
<GOOD> I've seen this suit before it's cool
<GOOD> Metal Sonic x Amy kinda cool
<GOOD> Sonic x Shadow also
<GOOD> Good morning
<GOOD> Indeed
<GOOD> I just finished up my last essay for this academic year
<GOOD> My OC stuff is getting more and more complex and hard to plan out
<GOOD> I've been sitting on this one for a few weeks but I'm still going
<GOOD> I would beat 1 gorilla
<GOOD> I don't need that
<GOOD> New stress ball yahoo
<GOOD> It's in the shape of Pomni
<GOOD> This airbrush colour doodling is kinda fun
<GOOD> It gives off a vibe
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> They aren't done yet but yea it's a start
<GOOD> I play regular slop
<GOOD> Kagurabachi anime soon
<GOOD> I missed sword anime
<GOOD> Goodbye, the plant.....
<GOOD> If I wanted a fish it would be a black moor
<GOOD> They are adorable
<GOOD> Pet fish discussion
<GOOD> I still haven't had a job it fucking sucks
<GOOD> I want a job, give me a job
<GOOD> I live in a somewhat remote area of Wales
<GOOD> And I go back home for like 3 months out of the year
<GOOD> Yapped about OCs to a friend and didn't realise they were in a 1 word response mood
<GOOD> What if they added a Bendy pea and it shot wrenches
<GOOD> Oh they should actually add that
<GOOD> The game would go viral
<GOOD> I hope so
<GOOD> If they aren't, history will call them best friends
<GOOD> Also Vill I made an OC beta design and he looks like a fanon purple guy
<GOOD> Michael Afton in the shipping community
<GOOD> I don't see the issue with shipping Michael Afton, but FNaF shipping in general is a minefield
<GOOD> There's like 4 characters that exist at one time and are adults
<GOOD> I don't do it because of that so it's like lmao L
<GOOD> Hi
<GOOD> Mmm this dude needs more sauce
<GOOD> He has knuckle dusters and that's about it, idk whether I wanna overcomplicate it
<GOOD> I also don't know how to/if I should make him look more ill
<GOOD> My Luchador is finally doing it  I'm so proud
<GOOD> Farewell Chad, Photo... And even you, Lucky Cat
<GOOD> I'm gonna become Majin DJ
<GOOD> what if you killed me in Mario and then I'm Dry DJ
<GOOD> Holy shit
<GOOD> I still hate plasma deck
<GOOD> It sucks bro
<GOOD> I'm screaming
<GOOD> I think I'm at like, 3 or 4 decks left to gold stake
<GOOD> Maybe 5 actually
<GOOD> Red, Blue, Black, Plasma and the telescope one I don't use because it's boring
<GOOD> Yeah it just makes Emperor worse
<GOOD> That's about it tbh
<GOOD> Also I've started taking Sigil on basically every run when available now
<GOOD> Sigil basically sets up the entire rest of ur run I love it
<GOOD> Seals are one of my last options tbh unless I'm already locked into smth
<GOOD> The order goes Immolate -> Sigil -> the rare joker one -> Cryptid -> anything that makes cards as long as they benefit my build like the face card one -> seals
<GOOD> $20 is a way to get more money
<GOOD> 20 dolar
<GOOD> My recent bit is calling everything an econ joker tbh
<GOOD> Joker Stencil is a crazy early game econ joker imo
<GOOD> Oh actually Poik did I tell you, I bought Sixth Sense on a run the other day, popped Sigil and it all turned into 6s
<GOOD> Yummy in my tummy
<GOOD> I had another one with 9s but I didn't get Cloud Nine :((
<GOOD> I thought Ouija was the suit one
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Then yes I mean Ouija
<GOOD> Ante 2 Ouija is godly bc you can literally just pop early 5oaks
<GOOD> Second fire alarm in 1 day I hate being easily overwhelmed by noise
<GOOD> I wonder if bagging will still work in Mario kart world
<GOOD> It seems significantly weaker
<GOOD> Very runner focused game so far
<GOOD> Fury is a 6/10 emotion
<GOOD> Maybe a 7 actually
<GOOD> Why are you being fake deep
<GOOD> It's midnight I don't have time for fake deep, Freddy will become active in 2 hours
<GOOD> I didn't say the statement was false
<GOOD> I said the deepness was fake
<GOOD> Almost everything is a social construct it's just a really vapid observation to hear
<GOOD> Maybe I'm just being a hater because it's late
<GOOD> I know someone irl with a twirly cartoon moustache and it's cool
<GOOD> He pulls it off very well
<GOOD> I don't do facial hair
<GOOD> Which reminds me I have to shower tomorrow morning
<GOOD> Depends on how I'm feeling yes
<GOOD> And today was kinda shite so I just laid around and did work and some shopping instead of taking care of myself
<GOOD> I did go to a toy store tho so I'm quite happy
<GOOD> They had digital Circus merch somehow
<GOOD> Why do you remind me of DanTDM, like not in any particular way of appearance you just like, do
<GOOD> It may be the expression and the kind eyes
<GOOD> I wish I could send voice messages smh/s
<GOOD> Not good or bad particularly, but I like him so
<GOOD> Might fill this out for smash in the morning
<GOOD> Yveltal was goated last gen tbh
<GOOD> Yveltal in gen 8 VGC was a monster
<GOOD> Loved using it
<GOOD> I wouldn't say that
<GOOD> The best mons of all time are ones that excel in multiple aspects
<GOOD> Or are an insane savant that just doesn't have checks in any form but those are rare
<GOOD> I spent an hour and a half throwing a ball into the air and catching it while laying in bed
<GOOD> My ass was pretending to be a grounded kid in a movie it was so fun
<GOOD> I need to buy a real superball to just toss at shit
<GOOD> Morning
<GOOD> Good start to my day
<GOOD> New Dandadan
<GOOD> Is Dr Stone not a manga
<GOOD> I wanna do OC work
<GOOD> Non binary
<GOOD> Google it, there's lots of resources
<GOOD> General stuff like ref sheets and ideas
<GOOD> I put effort into all of them
<GOOD> They all go through constant iterations too
<GOOD> I have a beta design rn but it's collaborative so I need the input from my bestie
<GOOD> Kirby is so cool
<GOOD> Paging  , check out my Wee
<GOOD> I don't know why we're still talking about the lions bc like, they won
<GOOD> Many have been saying this
<GOOD> I'm watching a backlog of old FusionZGamer vids
<GOOD> I randomly found a 2017 video of him scrolling a random fandom wiki gallery
<GOOD> And he's talking about new stuff for a fangame but he just keeps doing that shitty fandom thing where you scroll in the gallery and it goes to a completely different image
<GOOD> Yeah I'm watching him play an old tycoon fangame rn
<GOOD> He's murdering children
<GOOD> I didn't have my glasses on and genuinely couldn't see the insect for a second
<GOOD> I like it
<GOOD> Gyro is a jobro isn't he
<GOOD> I don't see it tbh
<GOOD> Johnny is the main protagonist and Gyro is the closest JoBro but by definition I think a JoJo has to have Jo- in their name
<GOOD> Yeah but by the definition imo he isn't a JoJo
<GOOD> His name is Gyro Zepelli, rather than Jolo Jopelli
<GOOD> Even if Gyro is a main character he is not a Jo
<GOOD> Idk I'd ask a clarifying question in that case
<GOOD> The definition of what a JoJo is varies but imo it's anyone in the bloodline (name optional)
<GOOD> I'm not saying it's a stipulation, I'm just saying that if Gyro Zepelli is a JoJo then the definition is too lax for me
<GOOD> Idk I knew a George fan
<GOOD> I arbitrarily count him because Geo-Jo
<GOOD> Remember when people thought Mario hated Luigi because Mario trod on his foot
<GOOD> Good evening chat
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> Gm
<GOOD> I wish I could learn a fighting game
<GOOD> My teacher is woke /j
<GOOD> It's clinical
<GOOD> Like calling women females
<GOOD> But furthermore it's just his opinion
<GOOD> Good afternoon
<GOOD> It's not just me right
<GOOD> Like he's actually there this time
<GOOD> Unfortunate
<GOOD> The pen marks isn't the thing I'm looking at
<GOOD> I don't see that one
<GOOD> The nose is also misaligned
<GOOD> I can't wait for competitive in MKWorld
<GOOD> I'm excited to see how it's optimised so I can improve again
<GOOD> FNaF x DBD news in like 2 days
<GOOD> FNaF x DBD news in like 2 days
<GOOD> I need to check what modules I'm choosing to study next year this afternoon actually
<GOOD> Might be crazy but I may actually be considering an oceanography based module
<GOOD> Wait do Satanists not worship Satan
<GOOD> I thought that was contradictory
<GOOD> I'm enjoying my studies rn, I have an Evolution/Ecology exam I'm super excited for
<GOOD> I literally didn't mention religion
<GOOD> Because I'm in a discussion wherein evolution denial is happening
<GOOD> Depends on if the person I'm talking to is a religious creationist or not
<GOOD> Anyway my exam is mostly on selection and honestly selection and evolution is kinda my jam
<GOOD> OH and programmed behaviour that was one of the most interesting parts
<GOOD> The movie felt like I had a cold and was watching an Amazon Prime series
<GOOD> Legally speaking the art they use for the AI isn't theirs, so the developers are in fact trawling shit that isn't theirs
<GOOD> Although I'm like 90% sure you're baiting so
<GOOD> Chat does anyone have Kingdom Hearts knowledge
<GOOD> I might actually try Kingdom Hearts again
<GOOD> Gurt:
<GOOD> The Coney Smash teeth tier list is so fun
<GOOD> Screams because I don't want my third main character in a row to use a sword but they're the kid of 2 swordmasters so idk what cool weapon to give them that accurately represents their personality and preferences
<GOOD> It's so bad
<GOOD> Do not post the gif I'm valid this time
<GOOD> The Minecraft movie is bad
<GOOD> You just said you were
<GOOD> You should make it 1 message
<GOOD> Also trying to give my OC a weapon it is not working
<GOOD> I am out of ideas :((
<GOOD> Kingdom Farts
<GOOD> What if Sora smoked weed and it was called Kingdom Darts
<GOOD> And it was a Dorkly video
<GOOD> MICHAEL DON'T LEAVE ME HERE
<GOOD> I want a pfp of a character but he only has 1 image that's officially in colour
<GOOD> And I can't remove the background
<GOOD> He should ask Northernlion
<GOOD> Watching those videos where it's like real musician reacts to video game music
<GOOD> It's very shallow oh that's a guitar
<GOOD> Like most videos in this genre
<GOOD> I need to decide on a weapon for an OC today
<GOOD> Maybe 2 if I'm locked in
<GOOD> And one character's name
<GOOD> I love pizza tower music
<GOOD> I love what I call jobslop
<GOOD> Where it's like real hitman reacts to executions
<GOOD> And they just sit there and nod
<GOOD> Real deaf person hears sound for the first time
<GOOD> Actually that just sounds like a MrBeast video
<GOOD> The gorilla
<GOOD> I really wanna draw new DK today tbh, I love movie/new DK
<GOOD> Just wait till you get to the Noise's music
<GOOD> still one of the best video game music compositions tbh it stresses me out so bad
<GOOD> And general confusion/madness
<GOOD> Salmon Run music in general is goated
<GOOD> actually this one is funny just because of the insane selection of sound effects they chose
<GOOD> Gato
<GOOD> Almost typed something
<GOOD> Anyway everyone what are your thoughts on the Smash teeth tier list
<GOOD> The Smash teeth tier list
<GOOD> The amount of teeth every character has
<GOOD> I didn't make it so
<GOOD> It was made by my second favourite streamer
<GOOD> And my favourite ragebaiter
<GOOD> I think so
<GOOD> I don't even know if they're siblings or partners
<GOOD> It's Coney time
<GOOD> Diddy Kong in no teeth is the funniest ranking on the list tbh
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> it's from this video
<GOOD> This is from Donkey Kong Country Returns and not Smash
<GOOD> His reasoning is that Min Min is made of ramen
<GOOD> Which is untrue but he's my streamer so I'll die behind it
<GOOD> Yes, he's just really good at baiting people
<GOOD> He has Samus in No Teeth
<GOOD> That's why he's the goat
<GOOD> Also I don't think we ever see Olimar's teeth
<GOOD> Erm... No he doesn't I don't see one...
<GOOD> Salt... He only has eyes Salt...
<GOOD> I don't like this
<GOOD> It's truly a shame we never see him without the mask
<GOOD> Meta Knight is like Shy Guy
<GOOD> Are you sure
<GOOD> This is someone's OC poorly edited into the show
<GOOD> Also chat I am lying if that was not clear
<GOOD> As is my favourite streamer
<GOOD> He picks and chooses seemingly at random what to grade things by
<GOOD> Meta Knight does in fact have a mouth
<GOOD> And he loses his mask basically every time you beat him
<GOOD> The reply is there
<GOOD> That specific Hero has a hamster in his pocket
<GOOD> Probably because it's funny
<GOOD> The other mii fighters are in the might have teeth tier
<GOOD> Rayman will break out of the ice in SSBU Deluxe for Switch 2
<GOOD> Ngl I think bears are my favourite terrestrial mammal
<GOOD> Grizzly bears
<GOOD> I want a bald cat
<GOOD> I'm still waiting for all the Pikmin and Olimar as one Mario Kart character
<GOOD> Beerus
<GOOD> Chat why is my YouTube playlist playing Bob Omb vs Creeper rap battle over and over
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> My only pet rn is my moss balls
<GOOD> I'm so excited for MKWorld
<GOOD> I'm gonna be a day 1 Pianta main
<GOOD> I love Piantas
<GOOD> Was this the whole Smash Kart thing
<GOOD> I'm indifferent on the situation but I also don't think we should add many more
<GOOD> I think add the last 2 members of the big 5 of Nintendo then that's it
<GOOD> (Kirby and Olimar)
<GOOD> I am going to kill you /lh
<GOOD> I hate Geno so much
<GOOD> They brought him back
<GOOD> He's a bike
<GOOD> Fucker deserves it too after SSBU
<GOOD> I played Mario RPG last year and genuinely I don't understand why people like Geno
<GOOD> He's the most flat character in the game and the game is full of flat characters
<GOOD> He's literally just hype moments and aura
<GOOD> The world is healing if people don't know Geno
<GOOD> No more Waluigi, no more Geno, no more Mach Rider or Grinch Leak or Shadow
<GOOD> The world has moved on
<GOOD> I love Shadow
<GOOD> He's my favourite character of all time
<GOOD> I literally would not mind Shadow in Smash actually
<GOOD> But it's from a different era
<GOOD> Remember Doom Guy and Isabelle
<GOOD> That era is gone
<GOOD> Oh my god wait do you guys remember this
<GOOD> I would kill for a real Shadow in Smash tbh
<GOOD> Like not a Sonic echo
<GOOD> Or like, a pseudo-echo
<GOOD> I mean no, look at SxSG
<GOOD> His up B is doom wings think about it
<GOOD> His side B is like Mii Brawler side B and it's Doom Combo
<GOOD> Or give him spears like Sheik
<GOOD> Dude I wanted Phoenix Wright in Smash so badly
<GOOD> I really thought Rayman, Phoenix Wright, Paper Mario and Doom Guy were coming
<GOOD> I'm ngl I still believe he's there
<GOOD> Like he's right there
<GOOD> He's gonna break out one day
<GOOD> Cool I love fire emblem
<GOOD> Hopefully Chrom gets into Mario Kart
<GOOD> What if Mario Kart had a bunch of characters in it like Knuckles, and Mario was racist
<GOOD> And they called it Racist Mario
<GOOD> Is that meant to be Dark Nebula
<GOOD> I think just keep the amount we have now roughly tbh
<GOOD> I doubt they take up much dev time
<GOOD> And they're different enough that I'd keep most of them
<GOOD> Byleth did piss me off tbh
<GOOD> Dude but what if Mario's mushrooms were drugs
<GOOD> What if they were drugs and Mario was on drugs and tripping
<GOOD> Hero is still one of my favourite DLC characters tbh
<GOOD> I'm referring to any of them tbh
<GOOD> Dorkly, Mashed, even Mario's Last Life but that isn't an animation
<GOOD> Sephiroth is number 1
<GOOD> Sephiroth is like the best DLC reveal they've ever done minus maybe Steve
<GOOD> Yes, I am British and also I knew it before watching the Chazington video on it
<GOOD> I think I remember when Mashed was created
<GOOD> Can we hate on Pirahna Plant yet
<GOOD> Yeah because he was first party
<GOOD> He was also THE FIRST DLC RELEASED
<GOOD> I just think they could get one more character that wasn't Plant
<GOOD> I watched Sonic for hire a bunch as a kid
<GOOD> Mercedes ad Mario
<GOOD> Can we talk about how Mushroomy Kingdom is the funniest stage in Smash
<GOOD> This will be Mario in 2014
<GOOD> Every time I see Mushroomy Kingdom I think of this
<GOOD> DUDE STOP FUCKING STEALING MY BITS
<GOOD> Are you serious
<GOOD> This is how it's felt talking to people about Mario Kart World graphics
<GOOD> Guy who only watches Arlo when I say the game looks good: I can't believe you're shilling for this 600 dollar game
<GOOD> Can I be annoyed at Arlo yet
<GOOD> Guys that I don't like but I only don't like because of their vibe and not anything they've done:
Arlo
Saberspark
~~Phisnom~~
<GOOD> Phil gave me a valid reason to dislike him finally
<GOOD> I never looked into it but I watched a few of his videos and he made me deeply uncomfortable
<GOOD> I don't trust anyone with a rantsona
<GOOD> That's terrible wtf
<GOOD> Either way unfounded accusations like that aside he just makes me uncomfortable
<GOOD> Cue that one clip of him talking about Star vs the forces of evil where he's like NEW FANTASY CRUSH UNLOCKED
<GOOD> I only found out last week that he wasn't the Squidward Security system guy
<GOOD> I think he's still the Turning Red guy tho
<GOOD> Something something Planet Dolan
<GOOD> I don't know
<GOOD> I never watched Planet Dolan I only know him tangentially through Chazington
<GOOD> Same as Odd1sOut
<GOOD> He's too old to order off the kid's menu
<GOOD> Why is critikal here
<GOOD> Hey guys, this game is poopy butt fuck fuck poopy like an ass poop, that's about it see ya
<GOOD> I do not care for critikal
<GOOD> I drank prime once and there was actually like, goop/fluid in the inside of the bottle it was disgusting
<GOOD> I have no idea what it was
<GOOD> Fair
<GOOD> Anyway AVGN better frfr
<GOOD> Omg budder Freddy!!!
<GOOD> I did not grow up with much CaptainSparklez
<GOOD> I watched BajanCanadian and Jerome, DanTDM, PopularMMOs and Jen, Ssundee
<GOOD> Oh and ExplodingTNT
<GOOD> I still own the ExplodingTNT Tube Hero
<GOOD> PopularMMOs beat up a police officer I think
<GOOD> I'd say based but I think he was also DUI
<GOOD> I forget what exactly he was arrested for the second time
<GOOD> Are you even allowed to
<GOOD> Funniest thumbnail ever tbh
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> He had like 3 partners iirc
<GOOD> Imagine if CaptainSparklez was the murderer in Minecraft story mode
<GOOD> Chat, FNaF x DBD in a few days
<GOOD> Well news about it
<GOOD> The Mimic will be in DBD soon
<GOOD> But I would find it really funny if it wasn't Freddy or Springtrap but a 3rd more sinister option
<GOOD> Me when I turn on the FNaF x DBD trailer and Twisted Wolf walks into frame
<GOOD> Honestly I hope if they add Springtrap, they give him a Yellow Rabbit skin and a Pitbonnie skin
<GOOD> I wonder if Springtrap would use Shadow Freddy in his kit
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> I want to cosplay that tbh
<GOOD> You can buy the bear suit online quite easily
<GOOD> I go by many names. Matpat, phone guy, Scott Cawthon
<GOOD> That would be really funny because of how out of character it is
<GOOD> Choosing the most peaceful and virtuous FNaF character to be the one that hunts down and murders people
<GOOD> Roxanne Wolf
<GOOD> FGTeeV survivor
<GOOD> (He forgot to brush his teeth)
<GOOD> Just realised if Springtrap gets a Burntrap/Glitchtrap skin then people will be more convinced that they are the same character
<GOOD> Same as Pittrap
<GOOD> I do not know
<GOOD> Also I wonder who the survivor for FNaF is gonna be
<GOOD> We have like 2 canon designs ever in the games and they are children
<GOOD> Michael Afton canonically resembles Rick Astley
<GOOD> I think they always have a survivor
<GOOD> Edwin
<GOOD> The killer is Tiger Rock
<GOOD> You could make it movie Yellow Rabbit and Mike
<GOOD> But you'd need the actor's likeness
<GOOD> I would love Movie Yellow Rabbit as the killer tbh
<GOOD> I fucking love the movie design for yellow rabbit
<GOOD> It's an important distinction
<GOOD> They have different designs
<GOOD> Ofc I know about hot chica
<GOOD> She is such a bad bitch though.......
<GOOD> Survivor puss in boots
<GOOD> Killer Death
<GOOD> They should add Popgoes the Weasel as the killer
<GOOD> Ok honestly, Pitbonnie would be my pick for killer but it's too specific for mass appeal
<GOOD> He's so cool
<GOOD> Into the Pit is my favourite FNaF game in forever
<GOOD> Can it be this guy from the book series I owned the entire series of
<GOOD> What if the killer was Chica and she had a machete and you're playing as Fixed Mangle and Chica is after you because you're dating Foxy
<GOOD> You don't know vro....
<GOOD> You weren't there....
<GOOD> You guys haven't seen FNaF the movie....
<GOOD> The Breaking Wheel is so cool
<GOOD> And fact number 7, Toy Freddy, he's.....
<GOOD> That's not funtime Freddy but he is hot
<GOOD> German Funtime Freddy is funny
<GOOD> Marcel have you ever watched the Tony Crynight FNaF movie
<GOOD> Me when I press the kill Foxy button
<GOOD> Do you like Vi Arcane
<GOOD> I like robots, like GlaDoS
<GOOD> Anyway check this ouy
<GOOD> I had a lecture yesterday on Game Theory and it hurt my head
<GOOD> Because every time they said Game Theory my head flashbanged me
<GOOD> She's so cute
<GOOD> Cyn murder drones
<GOOD> Ursula from Kingdom Hearts
<GOOD> That's Gruntilda
<GOOD> Gruntilda has the skinny sister
<GOOD> I didn't know that movie got a second one
<GOOD> I've watched 1 too few Schaffrillas rant videos to recognise the little mermaid 2
<GOOD> I'm so excited to play Mario Kart World
<GOOD> Yooo cool
<GOOD> I'm gonna be a Pianta main on day 1, I need to see the meta develop
<GOOD> I hope bagging isn't too nerfed it might create issues
<GOOD> I love new Donkey Kong so much
<GOOD> We don't know
<GOOD> Only Cranky so far
<GOOD> I didn't say they removed Diddy Kong
<GOOD> I said we haven't seen Diddy Kong yet
<GOOD> I hope he's in the game, same as K Rool
<GOOD> Diddy Kong isn't necessarily my favourite Kong tho
<GOOD> Did you know that rats pop their eyes out when they are happy
<GOOD> I like having Google
<GOOD> I just started googling about that one Japanese noise that's like YOOOOOOOOO and now I'm learning
<GOOD> Hell yeah new pfp
<GOOD> I'm so tired
<GOOD> I'm Odysseus and Penelope is video poker
<GOOD> I'm having the stupidest crashout ever
<GOOD> Also I want to buy the koi pond pfp effect
<GOOD> And I also want to rewatch Epic tge Musical
<GOOD> GRAND DAD
<GOOD> Sephiroth when Mario and Luigi pull out their hammers
<GOOD> I'm so disappointed in myself
<GOOD> My ass bought a koi pond
<GOOD> Feet
<GOOD> How do you even apply any tag from any server
<GOOD> I have an exam and an essay submission today
<GOOD> This is mid bait since like 70% of us don't like Pokmon
<GOOD> WE LOVE DK
<GOOD> I'm excited for Bananza but I can wait
<GOOD> Real ragebaiters interact with the community beyond simply posting inflammatory takes
<GOOD> You have to ingrain yourself before you start baiting so it blurs the line between bait and stupidity
<GOOD> The best bait is also one with an iota of truth in it
<GOOD> My genuine opinion is that BotW is mid, but it's not bait when I say it. However if I said yawwwn snoozefest game then it would be too inflammatory and become bad bait
<GOOD> Trolling is a science fr
<GOOD> My most sounds like bait but is actually my thought is that Persona 5 Royal is the most disappointing experience I've ever had playing a game
<GOOD> It sounds like I'm being hyperbolic but it's truly not
<GOOD> The server was also already inhospitable
<GOOD> Is Sonic Frontiers the worst open world game ever made
<GOOD> True..
<GOOD> Also before the bait talk is over, the best strat is to present a take that's moderate but still sounds outrageous
<GOOD> I once said Elden Ring was a 6/10 in my opinion and I was fucking immolated
<GOOD> Exactlyyyyy
<GOOD> I honestly have no clue, it's probably Rain World
<GOOD> Bloodborne is also up there
<GOOD> And like, Pikmin 4 ig
<GOOD> I didn't know what Pikmin to pick
<GOOD> And then like, FF7 is up there too
<GOOD> Which is expected because it's one of those games
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> I do not care for the Monsterverse
<GOOD> Any excuse being unprecedented trade price raises
<GOOD> I like this guy
<GOOD> Please don't let me get obsessed with a 28 year old Japanese only game
<GOOD> I'm like 5'8 ish
<GOOD> I don't think I have any friends 6 foot or taller
<GOOD> At least irl
<GOOD> My OC lore needs to continue being written
<GOOD> That's tall
<GOOD> I wish I was 4'11
<GOOD> I'm trans also
<GOOD> Feel free to ping me with any complaints you have if there's an issue
<GOOD> Anyway this game kinda fun
<GOOD> Yes, although idk what I'd add
<GOOD> One of my OCs needs a new body rn
<GOOD> Their ref is now officially outdated because this body got destroyed
<GOOD> So now VEE needs a new body
<GOOD> Yerp
<GOOD> I love when death isn't an evil force
<GOOD> Yep
<GOOD> I got the mario kart bundle
<GOOD> I have refused to play XC unfortunately
<GOOD> This sounds dumb but only e16?
<GOOD> Actually yeah I think my last big run was on Black Deck
<GOOD> So I had negatives etc
<GOOD> Money always solves everything
<GOOD> Jesus new pope already?
<GOOD> They work fast
<GOOD> I started XC1, got mildly hooked, went into the actual gameplay, got unhooked, then heard about cherrypicked XC2 stuff and now I want the hook to remain very far away from me
<GOOD> I bought and started this today, it is very fun so far
<GOOD> I think after playing Fire Emblem Fates I found my hard limit for what I'm tolerating from a game before I put it down for making me deeply uncomfortable
<GOOD> I liked the idea but then I also sucked at the game and the gameplay starting out was quite unfun, so I just kinda left it for now
<GOOD> The story was somewhat intriguing but not like, moreso than others yet since I'm only about 2 hours in
<GOOD> So I'm probably gonna play a new FF game if I'm playing another RPG
<GOOD> I don't like starting with numbered entries that aren't 1 usually
<GOOD> I'm very lucky that Fire Emblem in the west isn't the actual Fire Emblem 1
<GOOD> I made an exception for Final Fantasy 7 because it's Final Fantasy 7
<GOOD> Just remembered the only Dragon Quest game I've played is still just Dragon Quest 1
<GOOD> But yea I'm content just knowing Pyra and Mythra as those 2 assholes that I hate in Smash
<GOOD> Damn not even Splatoon 3?
<GOOD> Unless XC3 has explicit queerness instead of implicit
<GOOD> Oh yeah I've seen the first one
<GOOD> Thinking of how I should play SotN but then I keep thinking about a streamer I watch having a bit where he quit the game halfway through and says he completed it
<GOOD> Have you guys seen the new pope
<GOOD> He looks like a pope
<GOOD> So pretty good fit
<GOOD> TOMORROW
<GOOD> We already know we're getting news tomorrow lol
<GOOD> That's why I said TOMORROW
<GOOD> Five Nights fits more as far as slashers go for me
<GOOD> I'm more suprised about Kaneki yeah
<GOOD> Springtrap imo has become like, a similar campy iconic slasher to the old ones, just with less broad recognition
<GOOD> I think he's genuinely a really good design in general
<GOOD> Especially his Yellow Rabbit design that I'm hoping they use instead of Springtrap
<GOOD> I think this fit is hard
<GOOD> Another 3 years of Glitchtrap and Springtrap are the same person
<GOOD> If they release a Burntrap skin you will see me on the news
<GOOD> I'm talking about the uninformed members of the fandom
<GOOD> People who are in the FNaF fandom but pretend it ended like 8 years ago are under the impression all the -traps are the same character
<GOOD> I'm ngl I want the Mimic but it's unlikely we're getting it so
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> Ruin was way more polished and hopefully SotM is just functional on release
<GOOD> I love this movie
<GOOD> Looks like it's shaping up to be great so far
<GOOD> Glitchtrap is also The Mimic
<GOOD> In fact a lot of things are The Mimic
<GOOD> Tiger Rock is the Mimic, Burntrap is the Mimic, Jackie is the Mimic
<GOOD> They're all the Mimic
<GOOD> There's more than one plushie
<GOOD> For whatever reason Frights has another Plushtrap
<GOOD> No, the plushie was just in a Fazbear Entertainment warehouse
<GOOD> Although the general existence of Plushtrap is and has always been aggravating
<GOOD> Frights isn't canon but that would be the case yes
<GOOD> It's very likely that some unknown Yellow Rabbit plush, or alternatively the Springbonnie doll, were the inspiration for Plushtrap being made
<GOOD> Which is why Afton may have created it for the Dittophobia experiments
<GOOD> The fear experiments
<GOOD> The nightmares in FNaF 4 (based on what theories you subscribe to) are likely to be caused by hallucinogenic gas being used on Michael Afton
<GOOD> Michael was probably still a child at this point but yes
<GOOD> It's part of William trying to replicate the experience with crying child as part of his Agony/Remnant experiments
<GOOD> At least within the scope of this theory
<GOOD> It's implied Michael's nightmares are very similar to CC's anyway
<GOOD> But at the same time William is implied to have literally created a fake neighbourhood
<GOOD> So their situations were so similar it doesn't rlly matter who you're playing as (but imo since you play as Mike for the other 5 games it makes the most sense to me)
<GOOD> FNAF DBD IS IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS
<GOOD> Michael Afton please be pulled into the fog and join Dead by Daylight
<GOOD> I wouldn't call it murder
<GOOD> That was somewhat accidental
<GOOD> It's manslaughter tho
<GOOD> I guess because it's more brutal/less expected
<GOOD> Like getting hit by a car vs getting poisoned
<GOOD> Murder implies intent and sometimes premeditation
<GOOD> Also a good time to say I like the word premeditated
<GOOD> YEAAHHHHH
<GOOD> THAT'S GOAT RIGHT THERE
<GOOD> I'm waiting for the anime
<GOOD> Idc what people say, it can be a slightly less popular JJK
<GOOD> I mean I agree but I don't know if it has the same pull to general ppl
<GOOD> A lot of JJK's popularity was hoisted on exclusively Gojo tbh
<GOOD> I mean our mentor character needs to show what he can do still lol
<GOOD> Although he did show some insane aura he hasn't rlly done much
<GOOD> I didn't read much of JJK but wasn't it ||a train station|| or smth
<GOOD> No idea
<GOOD> Kagurabachi has some generational first villains tbh
<GOOD> And everyone is aura farming constantly
<GOOD> Did that not spoiler tag
<GOOD> I literally clicked the button to tag it
<GOOD> Ok that literally was not on me
<GOOD> I sent the image with the box clicked
<GOOD> K
<GOOD> The next chapter is in a few days
<GOOD> Oh 2 days
<GOOD> Idk when the Kagurabachi anime is we haven't gotten an announcement yet, just who's animating it
<GOOD> Either way my favourite character so far is Hiruhiko
<GOOD> I cannot wait for him to continue to be relevant with any luck
<GOOD> As someone that's interacted with a few systems it's usually their choice but I've heard a lot of we to refer to themselves
<GOOD> Some systems use some pronouns, others use others, some alters within each system use different ones afaik
<GOOD> Mimic DBD today
<GOOD> It gets revealed at 5pm for us so I'll let you know
<GOOD> Yeah
<GOOD> At least I think it does
<GOOD> It says 11am on their schedule
<GOOD> Vincent incoming
<GOOD> I mean it wouldn't make sense too much
<GOOD> He only ever rlly kills 1 person when not in the suit, and he's just a regular ass guy
<GOOD> I actually wouldn't mind Yellow Rabbit as opposed to Springtrap
<GOOD> In fact I'd prefer it
<GOOD> But there isn't much distinction to someone that doesn't engage with FNaF much so
<GOOD> Hell, I don't even mind a movie Yellow Rabbit design
<GOOD> My cope picks are the mimic and pittrap but we know it's Afton
<GOOD> There's no way it's not him
<GOOD> Can't wait for Afton to have his famous fire axe
<GOOD> Ben 10 alien
<GOOD> WHAT I NEED TO SEE
<GOOD> Oh my goodness I need it
<GOOD> Oh ew Overwatch SF
<GOOD> 2 HOURS UNTIL THE FNAF NEWS
<GOOD> No, new crossover
<GOOD> I've wanted this for soooooo long
<GOOD> What does it say in the image
<GOOD> The game it's crossing over with is FNaF, is everything dealt in absolutes
<GOOD> Nope
<GOOD> It got a pretty profitable movie and is getting a sequel this year
<GOOD> I think it's disingenuous to imply it's dead
<GOOD> That wasn't your assertion tho
<GOOD> Your assertion was FNaF died years ago
<GOOD> Then back it up
<GOOD> FNaF is arguably more popular than it's been in like 7 years at this moment
<GOOD> Now this is an opinion which I somewhat respect
<GOOD> The FNaF VHS boom happened literally like a year or two ago
<GOOD> FNaF is not going anywhere
<GOOD> I'd even argue Freddy has been cemented firmly in internet culture
<GOOD> Same as William
<GOOD> Fetch? Or Sparky
<GOOD> I wouldn't say next year tbh
<GOOD> I think the year after is more optimistic
<GOOD> This is bad bait I don't think people will jump to the defense of Fetch when Yellow Rabbit is a commonly used official name
<GOOD> And Lefty
<GOOD> Mangle FNaF movie later this year raaaaa
<GOOD> Good practical effects too
<GOOD> I still can't believe how good the set and characters looked
<GOOD> Blowing up a building is difficult
<GOOD> Toilet bonnie
<GOOD> I really hope FNaF movie 2 doesn't pull the bandage off on Springtrap
<GOOD> They need to save him for FNaF 3
<GOOD> Shadow would kill William Afton
<GOOD> I'm gonna scream
<GOOD> we're never escaping this
<GOOD> Just a reminder
<GOOD> I'm anxiously waiting yeah
<GOOD> Have you seen this
<GOOD> ASGHFFHHFGGGG YEAHHH
<GOOD> He's so mouldy
<GOOD> Same I'm picking up the game just for it
<GOOD> Jimmy are skins limited time in dbd
<GOOD> I don't wanna buy the movie skin straight away but I do want it
<GOOD> Ok sick
<GOOD> I wonder what other skins he'll get tbh
<GOOD> Do the license characters get stuff often?
<GOOD> Unironically buying and learning DBD just to play with him
<GOOD> I'm kinda upset about no survivors but the map looks sick
<GOOD> And it seems like Springtrap is gonna replace hooks exactly as I predicted
<GOOD> I've been thinking of springy in DBD for over 5 years and the suit hook thing is smth I've thought of forever
<GOOD> They didn't give much detail they just said it was some major change when playing as or against him
<GOOD> Also the Matthew Lillard lines still sound neat
<GOOD> I kinda wish the skin had the head, but ig they paid for his likeness
<GOOD> Still a good skin imo
<GOOD> Idk how much legendary skins are but idc I'm copping
<GOOD> I honestly wonder if like, regular Springtrap even has voice lines
<GOOD> Yeah I mean it's not like he doesn't speak, he just only does sometimes
<GOOD> Oh I don't mean like a gameplay polish thing
<GOOD> I mean like, sometimes Springtrap just does not say things
<GOOD> FNaF 3 Springtrap specifically which is the one they're pulling from for the design
<GOOD> He can speak he just doesn't much
<GOOD> Oh yeah we heard a few
<GOOD> Well yeah FNaF is my special interest and this is like its first crossover in a decade
<GOOD> Scott is famously not a crossover guy
<GOOD> That makes sense I didn't know about that
<GOOD> Yeah I don't doubt it, the art looks sick so far I'm just a bit frustrated because of the lack of stuff they told us
<GOOD> The new map looks cool tho, and apparently this patch they're adding a queue so you can play exclusively on the new map which is great for me
<GOOD> Because I really want to play in the pizzeria
<GOOD> Send it
<GOOD> The broadsword is so funny to me
<GOOD> I'd probably play other characters like Ghostface when not one tricking Springtrap
<GOOD> I know most of em
<GOOD> I haven't played Silent Hill but I would also try Pyramid Head BC he's cool
<GOOD> Yeah I like the knight guy
<GOOD> Btw  I looked specifically at what they said, they said Springy had an apparent side objective that affects both sides
<GOOD> So no idea what that means
<GOOD> Either that or he naturally does it and he can be repelled/distracted like the games
<GOOD> No I mean like, he could be broken but then you can lure him away/stun him or some shit easier
<GOOD> Yea idk what it could be
<GOOD> Is a Mori an instakill btw
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I thought you could just Mori them immediately
<GOOD> On some characters
<GOOD> Isn't that Ebony Mori, I had a few friends that used to play it
<GOOD> They hated every second of it
<GOOD> I'm reading people who actually play DBD talk about Springtrap and wdym the Xenomorph has turrets
<GOOD> That's so cool
<GOOD> Can you even directly hit a Survivor
<GOOD> I've only played Friday the 13th the game wherein that's very common
<GOOD> No I mean survivor hitting the killer
<GOOD> Or is your only counterplay pallets and juking etc
<GOOD> Hitting the Matthew Lillard skin and his springlocks fail, killing him
<GOOD> First Killer that can die
<GOOD> Is Ghostface's power just gained from tunnel visioning one dude and chasing them at full pelt
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Actually I just realised what the fuck is the background of the Springtrap image
<GOOD> Is that like purple rot on the left
<GOOD> I love Ghostface he's so funny
<GOOD> Oh my god
<GOOD> That's so funny I love that
<GOOD> Ollie Ollie Oxenfree is the funniest voice line they could have used to advertise the Matthew Lillard skin
<GOOD> Dude the ball pit is in the map
<GOOD> Also I use tone tags a lot
<GOOD> RAAAA I'M SO EXCITED
<GOOD> Also it is confirmed he's a knife killer
<GOOD> Spring Tap
<GOOD> Hell yea role reprised
<GOOD> Matthew Lillard
<GOOD> Matthew Lillard is voicing the movie skin
<GOOD> PJ Heywood voices him in the games
<GOOD> Lillard is the movie *skin* in the game, Heywood is the basic character VA both in DBD and the normal games
<GOOD> Heywood voices left, Lillard voices right
<GOOD> There's a McDonald's in the Pentagon
<GOOD> Sprink trap
<GOOD> I need to keep drawing sometimes but not today
<GOOD> I don't have a spark of inspiration this week except for writing
<GOOD> No, what's happening
<GOOD> I'm meeting pirates rn
<GOOD> Ah
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> The DLC character or
<GOOD> Movie skin too
<GOOD> No, assuming the leak is not the electric girl
<GOOD> He didn't do the voice for that skin apparently
<GOOD> Is there interesting stuff in there
<GOOD> A tb is a lot
<GOOD> I don't play other GG games who are Jam and Kum
<GOOD> Oh interesting
<GOOD> But yea I'm not plugged into FGC still, I wanna learn a game but don't have the time or patience
<GOOD> It's guilty gear strive
<GOOD> Oh I thought you meant like an actual Strive style model
<GOOD> That would be Akuma
<GOOD> I rlly wanna learn SF or Tekken
<GOOD> But like my ass cannot have the patience
<GOOD> I can't wait for the Tekken 8 Switch 2 port so I can play single joycon King
<GOOD> Hi char
<GOOD> I'm 5'7 at 19
<GOOD> I don't think I'm getting any taller
<GOOD> I mean I don't really care if I'm not super tall, so 5'7 is fine
<GOOD> It's a practical height
<GOOD> I'm AMAB so it's a pretty regular height, I'm not particularly fussed tho
<GOOD> I wouldn't mind being short
<GOOD> Being tall would annoy me I think
<GOOD> No you take more of my height so I'm 4'11
<GOOD> You can be like 7'2 and I'll be 4'11
<GOOD> I kinda want new swim shorts
<GOOD> They're gonna be funky colours
<GOOD> I want swim shorts with parrots on them
<GOOD> Or toucans
<GOOD> Bikinis seem awful
<GOOD> Swim shorts are goated but I also need to shave before I go to the beach
<GOOD> Dysphoria hitting mad hard today
<GOOD> Korewa
<GOOD> Monkey D Luffy
<GOOD> I need to learn makeup soon
<GOOD> Someone watched a Coney video
<GOOD> I tried food delivery once and it cost like a million dollars idk how people do it
<GOOD> 1 billion squid
<GOOD> My plush is here
<GOOD> I gave him my neck pillow
<GOOD> This is effective satire because the fascism is shallow and aesthetic
<GOOD> Of course it looks cool, it's all the cause has
<GOOD> We've seen it over and over where the horrific fantasy fascists are in cool armour so people flock behind them because they're so dumb they think such a shallow and banal cause can be made up for with aesthetics
<GOOD> Helldivers just cranks up the satire
<GOOD> Some people are too dumb to see that and they liken them to the WH40K marines, who aren't satire but also aren't backing the ideology they have
<GOOD> Some people are genuinely so stupid that they can't understand the most exaggerated caricature of a shallow fascist dystopia possible
<GOOD> The fucking setting is called Super Earth
<GOOD> Or at least the nation you fight for the cause of
<GOOD> The issue with making satire is that things are often just that cartoonish irl
<GOOD> Helldivers obviously goes over the top and successfully satirises it, but like the fact it had people unironically thinking Super Earth were the good guys because they were cool is scary
<GOOD> Yea like, isn't it implied the bugs are literally made of oil
<GOOD> Satire of Americana is impossible I fear
<GOOD> People saw the ||statue of liberty turn into a blind lady holding a sniper rifle that shoots a surface to air sniper shot at Japan|| in chainsaw man and people didn't understand what it meant
<GOOD> Yea CSM is awesome, Fujimoto's art of Captain America is also cool I think he isn't much of a fan of the US lmaooo
<GOOD> I can't even send the art here
<GOOD> That scene where a bunch of NRA members lose their trigger fingers must mean something tho /silly
<GOOD> Mildly good bait if only because it's something that's easily aggravating to say
<GOOD> The Gun Devil also looks sick
<GOOD> It reminds me of that one digimon that's just made of guns
<GOOD> I'd say it's a pretty off-colour joke
<GOOD> Anyway Chainsaw Man is peak
<GOOD> What is y'all's favourite devil in CSM mine is Falling
<GOOD> Choose a fear it'll probably have a devil
<GOOD> Just name your favourite fear then
<GOOD> I love the theories around why Chainsaw Man is so strong
<GOOD> I mean it exists out there in CSM's world, no design tho
<GOOD> Yeah but it would probably be weak
<GOOD> Not many people are scared of phohias existing
<GOOD> Bro I'm so excited for this VA work
<GOOD> I love Matthew Lillard's William Afton voice he's so uncanny
<GOOD> He voice acts the SKIN, not the character
<GOOD> Your bet was not correct
<GOOD> PJ Haywood isn't the old VA?
<GOOD> Who was the original VA then
<GOOD> Yeaa I heard
<GOOD> I actually didn't even know he did anything until yesterday
<GOOD> And then I got the full context including apologies
<GOOD> ChatGPT is kinda bad with sources
<GOOD> It's kinda bad with almost everything
<GOOD> It can make pretty neat small code blocks I guess
<GOOD> I use it for assistance in R if I haven't made progress in ages
<GOOD> Can you not just imagine this
<GOOD> I feel like using your brain to think of this creatively isn't very difficult
<GOOD> Especially the universe explodes
<GOOD> I invented this today it was fun
<GOOD> Vernier Caliper weapon
<GOOD> I mean I wasn't exactly brash about it, I just said I don't see the point when you can just use your brain, like not even in a you are dumb sense, in a think of ideas sense
<GOOD> Everyone can think
<GOOD> Schools expel kids for getting beaten up
<GOOD> Schools in general are about hoisting the effort onto the students
<GOOD> At least in the dealing with things department
<GOOD> I'm ngl I have never met someone without imagination
<GOOD> Then write more than 1 line
<GOOD> Or don't tbh I have basic ass characters
<GOOD> My basic ass characters got molded into new ones through the experiences the world gave them
<GOOD> Hell, on my phone rn I'm doodling how I want my new OC setting to go
<GOOD> Also just saying but this is why English is important to teach in schools
<GOOD> Creative writing and literary analysis are criminally important
<GOOD> Honestly the easiest way to write information about something is to say why to everything
<GOOD> Why was my character in an abandoned space station, why was the other one already there before her, why does it even exist
<GOOD> What was the space station doing, what other things were happening on the station
<GOOD> Also those names are the most shallow possible names
<GOOD> I don't really understand the fun in using ChatGPT to write your stuff, like isn't it meant to be fun
<GOOD> I don't find much interest in not doing any of the work yourself
<GOOD> Affecteon for Fairy type btw
<GOOD> There's also a general moral bad to using ChatGPT since it causes droughts
<GOOD> GenAI requires potable water to flush itself
<GOOD> So some ppl straight up die because they can't get water
<GOOD> Depends on the reason ultimately
<GOOD> If it's out of necessity I won't necessarily fault you but if it's for some shallow glory and patriotism I'll give a side eye
<GOOD> I do not like the military
<GOOD> My mom just sent me a picture of her with alcohol giving me a Grinch looking ass eyebrow raise
<GOOD> It is peak
<GOOD> Why is she eating a burger
<GOOD> Buying fallacy quiz on Steam so I can throw out random accusations mid debate
<GOOD> Hollow Knight players I summon thee to torture yourself playing Rain World
<GOOD> He plays FNaF
<GOOD> Montpellier
<GOOD> kill
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I'm still non binary
<GOOD> Chat I bought a neck pillow yesterday but I don't have the heart to take it away from him
<GOOD> Basically means I'm not in the gender binary of boy or girl
<GOOD> They/them
<GOOD> Toy store
<GOOD> Probably but not sure
<GOOD> The metal one has a very confusing texture tbh
<GOOD> It looks like it would be the most uncomfortable thing possible but it feels fine
<GOOD> I want the Metal Squishmallow
<GOOD> No, it's of Metal
<GOOD> Ollie Ollie Oxenfree
<GOOD> I'm warming up to Matthew Lillard William Afton a lot
<GOOD> Hello chaos
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> His takes for DBD lines make me happy I like the psychotic giddiness it exudes
<GOOD> It also just sounds unnatural idk how they got the casting so good
<GOOD> I still like game William more but I think it's cuz I grew up with him
<GOOD> Guy who came back one time:
<GOOD> (Surviving a fire does not count)
<GOOD> I watched Wesker gameplay today on Tiktok
<GOOD> It's trying to feed me DBD content
<GOOD> I mean you could say that for Glitchtrap too
<GOOD> But it isn't him
<GOOD> Afton's hubris is so funny bc he says he always comes back then dies in the same week
<GOOD> The vengeful spirit...
<GOOD> Balatro
<GOOD> I really need them to not fuck up Afton DBD
<GOOD> I put my faith in the devs tho
<GOOD> I need to see more Springtrap skins too
<GOOD> I hope we get Springbonnie
<GOOD> Or at least Game Yellow Rabbit
<GOOD> +2
<GOOD> We do not, mostly because I imagine that would be hellish for the mods to follow lmao
<GOOD> Yoooo she looks awesome
<GOOD> I'm tired of waking up at 6am
<GOOD> Good morning
<GOOD> What side of the Pokmon community are you on
<GOOD> Whenever someone talks like this I think of that one video about the top 10 hottest female Sonic characters
<GOOD> Erm... SO MUCH THIS!!!!
<GOOD> The hottest is Rika but the hottest man is Drayden
<GOOD> She was number 1 yes
<GOOD> I want to wuh luh wuh with Rika
<GOOD> What did they mean by this
<GOOD> They're such good friends
<GOOD> Also as far as Sonic characters go they all float around the ballpark of late teen except the ones that are obviously children
<GOOD> Like 17-19ish since their original ages aren't really a thing anymore
<GOOD> Amy is not 12 she is leading a war effort
<GOOD> Vector is dating Cream's mom I hope he's an adult
<GOOD> Dude you can't do that that's a filter
<GOOD> Sorry I'm looksmaxxing I can't hear you
<GOOD> But yea it's like, most Sonic characters' ages from like 20 years ago should be taken with a grain of salt
<GOOD> Sounds like real mythology
<GOOD> Mythology is an Epic the musical reference promise
<GOOD> My friend dragged me into an Epic interest
<GOOD> The Pokmon fandom let me know how much I hate it from that leak
<GOOD> Bro I have a timer on my OC lore
<GOOD> I have to make a magic sword before the author makes 2 more
<GOOD> Yea it's just the behaviour around it that sucked
<GOOD> Ballerina cappucina
<GOOD> Lalalala lelule
<GOOD> My Tiktok seems to be insisting that I'm interested in still water
<GOOD> I saw someone say Bonnie was meant to be blue instead of the purple colour he is in game the other day and it annoyed me
<GOOD> Like in DBD he's purplish and it's like, yeah he always has been purple
<GOOD> Exactly lol
<GOOD> He has never not been purple afaik
<GOOD> He's changed shade of purple but he's always been purple
<GOOD> Hi chat
<GOOD> kill me btw
<GOOD> (I also beat gold stake plasma and only have like 6 more stakes across 3 decks left)
<GOOD> I also wish I had screenshotted a different run but I had Acrobat and 2 Polychrome eternal 4x 4oak mult
<GOOD> I think 4oak is The Family?
<GOOD> But I lost it because I didn't draw one at all
<GOOD> Hell yeah my least favourite deck is done
<GOOD> Nintendo brand love hotel
<GOOD> I used to go with my nan and light candles for my granddad, I think she was Christian although she didn't talk about it
<GOOD> It was nice enough to do though
<GOOD> I should light a candle for my nan some time
<GOOD> Atheism is a belief
<GOOD> It is not a religion
<GOOD> Atheism is also a belief lol
<GOOD> Like you believe there are no gods, that is a belief
<GOOD> Ok then what do you believe
<GOOD> Yeah, so you don't believe there are gods
<GOOD> Not believing there are gods = believing there are no gods
<GOOD> Which is in itself a belief
<GOOD> It's like how not choosing an option is also a choice
<GOOD> This isn't even a religion thing it's a general definition thing
<GOOD> I mean I was under the impression I was dull for talking about it
<GOOD> Not choosing something is also the default state, you have to actively choose something
<GOOD> Doing nothing is still a choice whether it's active or passive
<GOOD> So are you suggesting atheism becomes a choice and therefore a belief once you're aware of the options available
<GOOD> I agree but it's still an important distinction to me
<GOOD> I believe there might be gods
<GOOD> See how these are different beliefs
<GOOD> As is believing there are none
<GOOD> I believe there's aliens out there somewhere tbhtbh, if someone believes there isn't then that's also a belief
<GOOD> I bought my dad gin yesterday
<GOOD> It was made locally
<GOOD> I was meant to get rum but he doesn't mind gin
<GOOD> I went to a pirate festival thing, very cool
<GOOD> Someone was there dressed as Art the clown, but in a black and white captain outfit
<GOOD> I wanted to get a selfie with him tbh
<GOOD> There was also an old ass boat sailing around
<GOOD> I mean I literally have at the request of chat
<GOOD> Switch 2 in less than a month
<GOOD> Damn
<GOOD> I'm so excited for DK tbh
<GOOD> Movie DK is such a cute little baby
<GOOD> I wanna hug him
<GOOD> I would never know what it's like to control someone with autism
<GOOD> (I might be lying)
<GOOD> I talk to myself
<GOOD> I also dance and spin around and shit it's so fun
<GOOD> Usually when I'm excited
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> It does suck when ur just chatting in your head and an intrusive thought speaks through a megaphone tho
<GOOD> Like damn bro shut up
<GOOD> Yea
<GOOD> Dude I need to get a rush on my OC before the author makes the next 2 canon
<GOOD> 5 of the 7 are already confirmed
<GOOD> Magic swords
<GOOD> I'm assigning instruments to my OCs rn
<GOOD> They don't play anything it's just the instrument associated w them
<GOOD> So far I have pianos, trumpets and electric guitar
<GOOD> Bc it's for their music rather than the literal instrument in their world
<GOOD> They aren't making music
<GOOD> It's like, themes
<GOOD> It's not an in universe thing
<GOOD> Trumpets fit a specific OC for their theme
<GOOD> Same with piano and electric guitar
<GOOD> Yeah exactly
<GOOD> Send
<GOOD> Depends on what character, I think I decided on Jolyne's beatdown for the action theme of the piano character because it sounds elegant
<GOOD> I found a triumphant ass trumpet theme from Dokkan for the trumpet character
<GOOD> Sure thing
<GOOD> Oh and one of the villains is like, what I can only describe as goopy music
<GOOD> Sci fi type stuff, Earthbound weirdcore etc
<GOOD> They're an experiment
<GOOD> Idk what the instrument is called
<GOOD> I think the Luigi's Mansion theme uses it
<GOOD> It goes like bwweoeewww
<GOOD> It sounds like slime
<GOOD> No, I'm playing Bayonetta rn
<GOOD> I have also played MGRR previously
<GOOD> But that's about all my hack and slash experience except for Darksiders as a kid
<GOOD> Arigato, Place Japan......
<GOOD> I'm glad you enjoyed
<GOOD> Name's Dante, Dante the demon killer
<GOOD> Has a nice ring to it
<GOOD> Whooo the FUCK are youuuuu
<GOOD> My favourite bit recently has been to say me during evo grands when I say some stupid shit about any fighting game
<GOOD> I wanna play Tekken
<GOOD> I'd love to play Kazuya but I know my ass would only be able to play King
<GOOD> PS5 can't run a game
<GOOD> This is not surprising to me
<GOOD> Why would you make it do something it wasn't made for
<GOOD> Dw I got this
<GOOD> Who wants to talk about FNaF guys
<GOOD> Who wants to talk about FNaF
<GOOD> Go to bed or I talk about FNaF
<GOOD> Who wnts to talk about FNaF
<GOOD> No I'm ok
<GOOD> I do not like FNF when Sonic.exe isn't there
<GOOD> I am Sonic.exe
I was brought to life on an evil CD
<GOOD> I like Silly Billy
<GOOD> That's all the fake energy I can muster for something I don't love
<GOOD> Sometimes the mod makers make cool shit tho
<GOOD> Sparked new interest in creepypastas
<GOOD> Guys who fw Jeff the Killer
<GOOD> He's gonna Jeff the Kill you
<GOOD> I'm Slenderman, find my pages
<GOOD> And I'm Kanye West
<GOOD> What even was this song about
<GOOD> I only remember the part where Kanye West walks on screen
<GOOD> Wagwan Delilah top 10 songs of all time
<GOOD> Bob omb vs Creeper rap battle
<GOOD> I'm DJ the Killer
<GOOD> Guys for Halloween we should all be Creepypastas
<GOOD> I'm SlenDerJ
<GOOD> I've recently started Panopticon posting tbh
<GOOD> Posting about the Panopticon
<GOOD> Chat we should all get together and build a big tower
<GOOD> We should get together and build a tower that scrapes the heavens irregardless of our shared language
<GOOD> Ok, let's build this Tower, let's build this tower with bricks
<GOOD> I still have never used Merry Andy properly
<GOOD> Same as Hit the road Jack
<GOOD> Evil and intimidating Window
<GOOD> Luchador:
<GOOD> Ectoplasm and Luchador in the buffoon pack
<GOOD> I got a fucking negative splash in the shop last run
<GOOD> I should have his ass in my deck too tbh
<GOOD> I don't know what other options for diamonds are
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Negative luchador in the buffoon pack
<GOOD> Oh yeah poik did I show you this one too
<GOOD> Ante 1 first pack
<GOOD> Marcel
<GOOD> There's a bunch of crossovers but I think I have Bugsnax, Shovel Knight, Vault Tec and Gungeon on my suits
<GOOD> Actually I don't think it's Bugsnax idk what I usually have
<GOOD> I didn't say it was indie only
<GOOD> There's a Civ 7 themed deck
<GOOD> And Warframe iirc
<GOOD> Told you bro
<GOOD> Time for the Luchador to do it
<GOOD> Sans, Papyrus and Gaster but Gaster's is blank
<GOOD> I'm ngl I could write a vent piece about Gaster
<GOOD> Mostly because there is literally no information about him ever
<GOOD> Dang
<GOOD> Gaster gives me nothing vibes because we don't even know anything about him
<GOOD> Mysteryman might not even be Gaster we don't get any answers
<GOOD> I'm Wing Gaster! The royal scientist
<GOOD> Human, I remember you're Wing Gaster
<GOOD> Fucking exactly
<GOOD> Gaster's widely accepted design isn't actually Gaster
<GOOD> Like wtf
<GOOD> I am Gaster
I fell into the core
I am Gaster
No one will ever know my secrets, aaahhhh~
<GOOD> Yeah I remember
<GOOD> I'm a FNaF fan I need information pumped directly into my bone marrow
<GOOD> Loud incorrect buzzer
<GOOD> Our only knowledge of Gaster in Deltarune is the egg and maybe the phone
<GOOD> Is it even meant to be Gaster
<GOOD> He has a name now Bounty
<GOOD> Stop deadnaming Ralph my goat
<GOOD> Where is the evidence for that
<GOOD> I like that ship tbh
<GOOD> It reminds me of Marxgolor
<GOOD> He fell into the core
<GOOD> How is Toby Fox more obfusciating with information than Scott
<GOOD> I don't think that will help based on the current chapters

<GOOD> I made a bet with a friend on what genre of new character I get unhealthy obsessed with
<GOOD> Edwin putting the pieces together
<GOOD> Amazing but they have to pull it off right, everything we've seen so far except the lack of a killer has been perfect
<GOOD> Also RIP fire axe William fans
<GOOD> I can't see this image in outside
<GOOD> It's bright
<GOOD> I have a creature in my basement

<GOOD> But not in the game
<GOOD> Springtrap and Kaneki is funny
<GOOD> What is bro doing in Tokyo
<GOOD> True
<GOOD> AVGN if he had bad taste
<GOOD> I knew you were gonna send this bro
<GOOD> Dw this is book only
<GOOD> William Afton doesn't either
<GOOD> They're using Haywood for his voice in DBD so you tell me
<GOOD> I mean he's a shit caricature Logan is just an asshole so he doesn't care
<GOOD> The guy that owns the channel
<GOOD> Alongside making SML and whatever mess comes with that he's shitty to other creators
<GOOD> New Kagurabachi chapter, weekly reminder to read Kagurabachi
<GOOD> Money's on sale for me rn
<GOOD> I'm making it all gold and scaling boots
<GOOD> Got something better vro
<GOOD> Money's on sale
<GOOD> Gold stake too
<GOOD> It wouldn't help
<GOOD> Would it not get sucked beforehand
<GOOD> Yeah but golden ticket activates on scoring
<GOOD> I guess but then you're losing out on x0.5 mult every hand
<GOOD> Oh well I got Perkeo lmao
<GOOD> So I'm just duping kings
<GOOD> Oh my fucking god I hate this game
<GOOD> Why does violet vessel exist
<GOOD> Dogshit
<GOOD> I hate gold stake
<GOOD> Wow this game is so fucking good hahahaha fuck
<GOOD> obelisk goes in the machine right
<GOOD> Or do I scrap my wee
<GOOD> My hands are pretty low I'm at a risk of resetting
<GOOD> I scrapped Obelisk and I'm on ante 8 tn
<GOOD> Rn
<GOOD> Also blueprint always goes on chad afaik
<GOOD> Unless you're copying multiple
<GOOD> Nvm I sold Wee for a temporary brainstorm so Yuri could win me another gold stake won
<GOOD> 3 decks left
<GOOD> Oh yeah also I didn't tell u about the conversation I had earlier where I almost cried trying to stop myself from laughing
<GOOD> They turned lead into gold at the large hadron collider
<GOOD> Where are my alchemist's at
<GOOD> I hope they don't copy the rest of Persona 5
<GOOD> Although the sky
<GOOD> Mindwave is not out yet
<GOOD> I know
<GOOD> No it's a Beldum question
<GOOD> Kagurabachi raaaaaa I love Kagurabachi
<GOOD> Pressing the button that kills you
<GOOD> Kickboxing was very fun to learn
<GOOD> I should start again when I have time
<GOOD> Kaneki, they've already fixed 4 generators
<GOOD> I love being queer for a moment
<GOOD> An instant of thuh luh wuh and then I switch back trust
<GOOD> Bob omb vs creeper rap battle in my playlist
<GOOD> I like women and enbies
<GOOD> Oh my goodness my favourite character in this manga is going through it rn it's making me sad :((
<GOOD> Me w him (Kagurabachi spoilers)
<GOOD> This might be toxic mlm in the future
<GOOD> But also I feel so bad for him rn
<GOOD> There's a figure in the hall
<GOOD> Oh that's gold, that's gold made out of lead in the large hadron collider
<GOOD> I didn't get an email from him
<GOOD> Possibly because I never told him my email
<GOOD> Sick I like it
<GOOD> Hell yeah it's Shane Dawson
<GOOD> His face looks long even in this image
<GOOD> I am going to call the Russian Sleep Experiment and they are going to Russian the Sleep Experiment you
<GOOD> Jeff the Killer will Jeff the Kill him
<GOOD> Hi char
<GOOD> Funny you should post him I'm making an OC around fire rn
<GOOD> Hell yeah I finally made OC progress
<GOOD> Chat I need assistance
<GOOD> What would you describe this outfit as
<GOOD> Chat do you fw his eyeliner
<GOOD> I love giving characters scars
<GOOD> It's a him also what is a homestuck troll
<GOOD> I used him as inspo for the eyes
<GOOD> Poseidon vs 600 men
<GOOD> 100 men is a lot of men, but when I say a billion lions is a lot of lions it's all noooo Kyogre can flood everything
<GOOD> What are the conditions under which the 100 men have to fight the gorilla
<GOOD> Do they have an incentive
<GOOD> This doesn't make sense to me because a lot of things use that abbreviation
<GOOD> Especially in a Pokmon server where Go is played
<GOOD> Balatro mentioned
<GOOD> Channeling Super Baby 2 rn
<GOOD> No they pretended they were gonna do that like twice
<GOOD> Then they didn't do it
<GOOD> DB or Z to start, then the other of the two, then Super
<GOOD> I started with Z, and tbh it's more palatable than OG
<GOOD> Convincing someone to read OG and then they read the very first chapter and also Roshi shows up and didn't go away
<GOOD> I just woke up but show me
<GOOD> Also if you are awake now and was awake at 2am you should be asleep rn
<GOOD> I made my OC cunty by accident
<GOOD> Someone just tried to tell me killing innocent civilians wouldn't paint you in a bad light
<GOOD> SHOW
<GOOD> I'm fucking crying why does Edwin look like a 20 year old man pretending to be Santa
<GOOD> He got the evil moustache
<GOOD> Oh ok lmao
<GOOD> Also I need that Tiger Rock plush
<GOOD> Well it's just a tiger but still
<GOOD> If someone pulls a knife on you, drive into a lamppost to draw attention and damage the car
<GOOD> I just watch House MD
<GOOD> Hey kid, nice to eat ya
Want a bite of Fazbear's pizza?
<GOOD> I like Dr House
<GOOD> I need to do literally anything for AF
<GOOD> I've just been drawing more and more OCs without any refs
<GOOD> I don't know tbh
<GOOD> I doodled this guy yesterday and now I wanna properly draw him
<GOOD> They are cute
<GOOD> I can't be arrested for all those babies I eated
<GOOD> I have full immunity
<GOOD> Why lol
<GOOD> Oh you mean like anti crab boiling, I agree
<GOOD> I thought you meant that I, personally, should kill the animal
<GOOD> But yea kill animals before you eat them
<GOOD> Animals feel pain
<GOOD> Yes??
<GOOD> How else would they know they're injured
<GOOD> Did you know they used to scientifically say babies didn't feel pain
<GOOD> I would say they do
<GOOD> Fish getting hooked through the mouth would probably hurt
<GOOD> Especially if the hook rips their flesh
<GOOD> The death laser is very humane
<GOOD> We should use it more
<GOOD> The death laser is very humane
<GOOD> Do you ever want movies free
<GOOD> Movies free
<GOOD> I'm watching House MD rn
<GOOD> Kinda a big fan of this House guy
<GOOD> He's like I hate women, give this small baby a lot of cortisol
<GOOD> Is it the one with the aliens
<GOOD> Or the one where he's talking to the child strapped to a hospital bed, being like you'll never see your family again
<GOOD> Ok
<GOOD> I LOVE WRITING ABOUT COOL SWORDS
<GOOD> I do not like Kirito
<GOOD> I think Chihiro mogs Kirito
<GOOD> I think don't watch it is a bad excuse for things that can be bad, like 7DS
<GOOD> I also don't want to talk about this
<GOOD> Chat when is he getting a DBD skin
<GOOD> Yellow Rabbit
<GOOD> He gets to meet Kaneki
<GOOD> I hope Springtrap does not meet Kanye
<GOOD> Who's below him because tbh I have a few questions
<GOOD> Also depends on what Springtrap
<GOOD> If you mean just 3
<GOOD> Springtrap from 3 doesn't really do much
<GOOD> Although in the books, Springtrap is pretty strong
<GOOD> Afaik the lore of DBD pulls them into the mist at a certain point in their story
<GOOD> Also this is very obviously not FNaF 6 Springtrap
<GOOD> I'm going out soon
<GOOD> However isn't Freddy Krueger weaker than Springtrap
<GOOD> At least in a 1 on 1
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Springtrap is implied to at least be stronger than a normal human at least
<GOOD> I don't remember if he gets shot in the books or not, they shoot the animatronics
<GOOD> Also if we're using Frights Springtrap he's just straight up busyed
<GOOD> Frights Springtrap implies he has some control over his Agony
<GOOD> I mean a taser didn't really work so idk
<GOOD> The Mimic is probably the physically strongest animatronic we've seen minus DJ Music Man
<GOOD> It took a forklift to kill book Afton for good
<GOOD> They drove him into a lake
<GOOD> I mean Frights might not be canon so him dying in 6 is likely to me (I'm not having this argument today)
<GOOD> But yes Springtrap is dead
<GOOD> The question was asked man
<GOOD> I said he was dead, but when he dies depends on whether Frights is canon
<GOOD> I don't work like that, that's too vague of an answer
<GOOD> I think Afton gets fucked up by most of those guys
<GOOD> If this is a composited Afton maybe but even then like, that's Dracula bro
<GOOD> That Xenomorph is killing his ass
<GOOD> Is anyone talking about inflation at all
<GOOD> I thought you wanted us to move on from topics
<GOOD> I can slander Springtrap until the cows come home
<GOOD> Idk 4 people might beat Springtrap if they jump him
<GOOD> Also isn't Ghostface 2 teens, that's less than 4 teens
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> Ok what does Sadako do to Springtrap
<GOOD> I think a gun *might* take him down but ehh
<GOOD> Evil wizard
<GOOD> I denied him his destiny
<GOOD> He got ourple sticker
<GOOD> >No retrigger
>Look inside
>A fucking retrigger
<GOOD> Chad isn't the only retrigger joker
<GOOD> I literally took 2 photographs and won so like lmao
<GOOD> I'm almost at gold stake on black
<GOOD> This is like my 3rd to last deck to gold stake
<GOOD> After blue it's planet deck and black
<GOOD> Also sock + 2 photographs would literally work on gold stake black deck
<GOOD> Sock retriggers all face cards
<GOOD> Luchador
<GOOD> ???? He's right there
<GOOD> This setup of Luchador and those 3 would win gold stake black deck since purple is where the acceleration of score stops
<GOOD> Especially because I had steel blue seals
<GOOD> So I was just using Merry Andy as a draw engine to make a bunch of 4oak faces
<GOOD> Chat what's the best FNaF fan song rq
<GOOD> I'm using spicy mayo for my nuggets rn
<GOOD> I love spicy mayo
<GOOD> Hey kids, nice to eat ya
Are you ready for Fazbear's pizza
<GOOD> Yes please
<GOOD> Eating my dinner and looking at a picture that can't be sent in genchat
<GOOD> Bugs mating ye it's cool
<GOOD> Picture
<GOOD> Yeah I'm a biologist that's predictable
<GOOD> Y/N: STOP FIGHTING!!!!
<GOOD> EREN YEAGER IS NOT A MONSTER
<GOOD> I think Yellow Rabbit is my favourite FNaF character now
<GOOD> Beware the man that speaks in hands
<GOOD> The new DBD survivor is... SCOTT CAWTHON!!
<GOOD> Everybody's shouted get out of my head at least once in their life
<GOOD> LET ME IN
<GOOD> It's a literary analysis of Eyeless Jack
<GOOD> I am retep
<GOOD> Can't wait to meet you
So join the animatronic family
<GOOD> We need a new bird animatronic ngl
<GOOD> We don't have enough bird animatronics it's basically just Chica
<GOOD> I love Break My Mind why did they make a sea shanty type thing for FNaF 4
<GOOD> Honestly it didn't occur to me that there were servers for sciences
<GOOD> Maybe I should join a marine bio server
<GOOD> Oh that's sex, that's sex in my genchat
<GOOD> I'm so bored
<GOOD> I ran out of FNaF songs to listen to so I've resorted to The Creepypasta Song
<GOOD> New OC immediately became a cross-fandom OC
<GOOD> Spindgtrap
<GOOD> I ruined my character  I must draw him again
<GOOD> I need to do purple stake black deck soon
<GOOD> I'm running out of other decks to beat on gold stake
<GOOD> Actually I might be on orange on Black idk
<GOOD> HOWWW DID I FUCK HIM UP THIS BAD I WANTED LIKE 10% MORE GOOFINESS
<GOOD> He lost his aura
<GOOD> The headshot conveys a demureness that he now lacks
<GOOD> It's the guy from the Jeremy Renner app
<GOOD> Fuck I wish that there was an app to tell me about Rennervations
<GOOD> He's my Kagurabachi OC he must be perf
<GOOD> I gave him a sword and everything he's gonna be beautiful
<GOOD> It would be so awesome
It would be so cool
<GOOD> Pikmin is an RTS game
<GOOD> Real time strategy
<GOOD> Purple is the goat
<GOOD> Chat I need feedback
<GOOD> Do you fw the face of 1, 2, or 3 the most
<GOOD> Why is your 3DS bricked
<GOOD> That shit is difficult to do
<GOOD> Oh
<GOOD> I think the outrage feels manufactured because the line being crossed has already been crossed a bunch
<GOOD> Like we already had digital disks on PS5 this gen
<GOOD> What games used it on PS4
<GOOD> Actually nvm I remember that
<GOOD> Does that require internet
<GOOD> My main gripe here is like, requiring the download of additional data over a network
<GOOD> Next year trust
<GOOD> Ppl saying that the standard switch 2 price was 90 dollars was so aughhh like are you dumb
<GOOD> Insane slippery slope
<GOOD> Yeah I'm excited for Bananza
<GOOD> It's a somewhat natural switch in the pricing of video games
<GOOD> Which is like, it sucks but be mad at the economy and corps in general
<GOOD> I don't think it's really a specific Nintendo issue, I don't really know why they're touted as the most anti-consumer company to ever exist (minus the lawsuits)
<GOOD> Aren't the Switch 2 carts like, special
<GOOD> Like the form of memory it uses
<GOOD> As well as being like, the size of a thumb
<GOOD> Also a side tangent but I saw a Cemu 60fps BotW today and they had a realistic lighting and textures mod thing on it
<GOOD> Art is dead as usual
<GOOD> Isn't PS Now a similar service to NSO, and I think game reselling is generally not in their hands, and also the killswitch thing is lmao (the rest is shit)
<GOOD> The remote bricking can be done on the PS3 I think
<GOOD> Like modding your system does in fact come with risks because it's their shit in the end
<GOOD> Is the Bloodborne PC port still up
<GOOD> They didn't go after the PS4 emulator?
<GOOD> That suprises me somewhat
<GOOD> Xbone has no games I fear
<GOOD> 20 dollars a month??
<GOOD> That's an insane amount of money wth
<GOOD> Microsoft is the death of gaming
<GOOD> This is truly anti consumer
<GOOD> Isn't NSO 20 a year
<GOOD> 50 if you want like a shitton of DLCs and the other consoles
<GOOD> Raaaa I drew a design I rlly like but everyone likes the other design I made more
<GOOD> Yeah that's what everyone else has said too
<GOOD> I still stand by the idea that microwaved water tastes worse
<GOOD> I haven't microwaved my tea in ages I own a kettle
<GOOD> It's 7am and I need to blast music because I'm going to shower
<GOOD> I hope my flatmates don't hear my FNaF music
<GOOD> Fan music, but it has a few original songs too
<GOOD> I.e Smashing Windshields and DJ Music Man's theme
<GOOD> Smashing Windshields is in game music
<GOOD> As is DJMM's theme
<GOOD> Smashing Windshields is actually my favourite official FNaF song
<GOOD> Die in a Fire has the funniest associated animation
<GOOD> Honestly It's Me might be becoming one of my favourite songs
<GOOD> And the associated (remade) animation goes crazy
<GOOD> Bendy was a
<GOOD> Oh Stuck Inside is also goated
<GOOD> And Break My Mind is fun because it sounds like a sea shanty
<GOOD> I have to listen to songs in the shower because otherwise I panic
<GOOD> I can imagine
<GOOD> It's already very emotion-screamy
<GOOD> Bounty listen to FNaF fan songs
<GOOD> (Do not listen to the Bonnie song it sounds like a joke)
<GOOD> GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OU
<GOOD> JACKIE IS UNDER MY SKIN BUGS ARE UNDER MY SKIN CLOWNS THE CLOWNS ARE UNDER MY SKIN
<GOOD> My replacement is blueeeeee
<GOOD> FUCK
<GOOD> I really don't wanna do the Edwin version
<GOOD> I think Stuck Inside loses a point in my ranking for saying unalive
<GOOD> Massive aura loss from William Afton
<GOOD> Torn Alive in the FNaF 2 credits
<GOOD> Holy shit Freddy in space movie
<GOOD> It would be really funny if the FNaF 2 or 3 movie just like, has The Mimic
<GOOD> Like he's just the villain of one movie and isn't mentioned again
<GOOD> Silly billy
<GOOD> I need to go out too tbh I might go to a coffee shop
<GOOD> Plug kinda weird but he chill
<GOOD> Marcel you're scaring me I think there is like exactly 6 coffee shops that are locally run in my town
<GOOD> I just haven't been to some of them  because they're run by church people
<GOOD> Americans don't use the word village?
<GOOD> Stupid question but is this because Americans don't have villages
<GOOD> ~~true~~
<GOOD> Isn't a town just a small city by that logic
<GOOD> You should just say city, small city and really small city
<GOOD> I wanna live in Canada
<GOOD> I don't know what marine environment I want to study specifically
<GOOD> The money spread in a discord server is crazy
<GOOD> I love the deep ocean
<GOOD> I wish I could go look at America's wildlife but alas
<GOOD> I mean I personally find them cute but people pretend they're scary for some reason
<GOOD> I love u dragon fish
<GOOD> If they discover a new coldest temperature do they shift it
<GOOD> Who up studying they cells
<GOOD> I'm sad because everyone likes my OC when he's handsome and well drawn but I always creature-ify them
<GOOD> I don't want handsome OCs
<GOOD> The Mimic is in less than a month
<GOOD> Chat idk which one to get they all look yummy
<GOOD> I don't think you had to tell me this lol, I know that brands use flattering pictures of their drinks to advertise
<GOOD> It doesn't change the ingredients
<GOOD> BAIKEN FANS THAT DON'T MAIN HER
<GOOD> Yes
<GOOD> Although I haven't been recommended their content in awhile
<GOOD> PvK, Rev and Big Yellow aren't making RBY content rn I think so
<GOOD> I forgot to fucking draw my character's hands in a doodle
<GOOD> Bro is folding nothing
<GOOD> NOOOO
<GOOD> This dude might die if he doesn't chill out tbh
<GOOD> He's a Kagurabachi OC but I sent him on some Dr Strange ass journey to my friend's Demon Slayer setting
<GOOD> So he immediately picks a fight with a demon not knowing they're not human and gets absolutely packed up
<GOOD> I drew him doing exactly this
<GOOD> Ignore Y/N
<GOOD> My friend is more partial to the handsome look for him, my look is usually more just survived a house fire
<GOOD> (He actually does look more like this, my style just makes him look really fucking weird)
<GOOD> He has a magic sword but it's not like, the Demon Slayer type of magic sword so demons don't really get affected
<GOOD> Idk my OCs develop a lot over a long period
<GOOD> Cephyl, my main OC, has been doing a lot to the point that their kid is taking up the mantle now
<GOOD> Cephyl's kid is in the middle she is called Nari (this is once again my friend's drawing of her because I don't have a ref sheet for her yet)
<GOOD> I've only drawn her weapon because I randomly got inspired
<GOOD> Very cool
<GOOD> I wish I could learn to 3D animate to make more content of him I can't wait a month
<GOOD> Finding Mimic content that isn't a joke is so tough
<GOOD> Deer antlers in general is good design
<GOOD> I almost got hit by a Ferrari
<GOOD> Nice ass car
<GOOD> I'd put that shit on my gravestone my ass died bougie
<GOOD> Wait wrong chat
<GOOD> Is anyone tired of no true Scotsmaning franchises
<GOOD> Chat guess which one is William Afton quick
<GOOD> WRONG!!!!!!
<GOOD> I've been talking about FNaF all day I'm so happy
<GOOD> Old
<GOOD> Hai
<GOOD> I heard the switch 2 specs got revealed
<GOOD> Hello, you're the first Kagurabachi fan I've found in the wild
<GOOD> And you are also non binary
<GOOD> Idk I heard it was alright
<GOOD> Bro is buying the Switch 3 wtf
<GOOD> What kind of price is that
<GOOD> Is this a 90 dollar game thing again
<GOOD> I bought mine with Mario Kart for 450
<GOOD> Which is like 600 dollars I think
<GOOD> I don't know conversion rates
<GOOD> Gleeporaglorpi
<GOOD> Oh hell yeah Donkey Kong mentioned
<GOOD> I love DK raaaaa
<GOOD> I'm excited for Bananza
<GOOD> Also isn't DK64 like, the most tedious game to ever exist
<GOOD> It's one of the few DK games I haven't played but it seems like Banjo-Kazooie but with like 6x the collectables
<GOOD> And they're character specific
<GOOD> I've still never used Hack correctly tbh
<GOOD> strangest Gold stake in history
<GOOD> 2 more decks to go
<GOOD> Black and the telescope one
<GOOD> Mostly because I don't like either deck
<GOOD> Yeah it's just annoying
<GOOD> I'm at orange on both I think
<GOOD> Nvm I'm at gold on Nebula then Orange on Black
<GOOD> Yeah the early game is just kinda bullshit
<GOOD> I hate high stakes if I'm being honest
<GOOD> discard is ass and the dev knows it which is why he's reworking it
<GOOD> I wanna pull off the Mr Bones glitch tbh
<GOOD> Hello
<GOOD> Yeah it lets you get an absurd record on rounds
<GOOD> it works on Endless
<GOOD> TLDR get 2 Mr Bones, get your wincon 25%, then deplete your entire deck
<GOOD> Apparently game speed also affects the amount of antes it passes, someone got to like ante 900 by popping this on Ante 8's boss blind
<GOOD> Oh it also has to specifically be on the boss blind
<GOOD> I reckon on white stake abandoned dcek against The Hook, it's not so bad
<GOOD> This is true
<GOOD> Bichael Afton
<GOOD> Biketrap
<GOOD> Tbf I wanna discover a new species, it's pretty easy in the ocean
<GOOD> Random nematode
<GOOD> I need to mess with my sci fi setting more
<GOOD> Ship designs are my current gripe I want them to look awesome
<GOOD> I haven't designed animals but rn my main character is a bacteria so lmao
<GOOD> I don't think it's too rooted in reality
<GOOD> Yeah I just never get Hack
<GOOD> And I usually trend towards faces
<GOOD> What's the Schnozz for
<GOOD> Expelling the heat?
<GOOD> Yeah I thought that was the case, neat
<GOOD> Trying to think of furred species that inhabit deserts rn
<GOOD> I don't know how locomotion underground really works
<GOOD> So not sure what adaptations they need
<GOOD> Like you could have fur that traps environmental heat and keeps the animal cool briefly above ground
<GOOD> At least in a sci fi setting
<GOOD> Oh ok
<GOOD> I'm making a humid ass planet rn but I haven't thought of much wildlife yet since it's a pretty short arc and only takes place in one jungle setting
<GOOD> I'm tempted to just throw in a few apelike animals and strange plants and call it a day
<GOOD> Probably some reptiles too
<GOOD> Because the focus of the arc is a few days of surviving, then attacking a corporation's base running a drilling operation there so it can be looted for a way off the planet
<GOOD> The planet is undeveloped and got bought by a megacorp for redevelopment
<GOOD> Or at least in part, a planet is a planet after all
<GOOD> No, just writing stuff
<GOOD> I think I'm gonna make the apelike creatures huck rocks at a great speed
<GOOD> Apes tend to have like, short-action(?) muscles for fast contractions so if they have long arms they could use them like trebuchets
<GOOD> And if they have overly developed arms they might have reduced feet
<GOOD> And then ways of shading their eyes if the rock development is to smack birds out of the sky or something
<GOOD> Either that or they break armadillo-like creatures over boulders by tossing them at jagged edges
<GOOD> That's a good general shonen trope
<GOOD> Having someone with a disproportionate power level show up makes things interesting
<GOOD> I mean the hair could just be to maximise surface area if these fish are any sort of filter feeder
<GOOD> If they're mimicking plants they may as well feed while acting immobile
<GOOD> Yeah that's how a lot of suspension feeders work
<GOOD> If you wanna do extra alien stuff you could give it some crazy teeth so it can just like, dig directly into the rock when suspending itself
<GOOD> But if it's a pelagic species it may not be the best idea for them
<GOOD> Hmm
<GOOD> What aspect of it is psychic
<GOOD> Oh ok that's cool
<GOOD> Maybe if it has an insane nervous system it can use electrosensory tracking for predation
<GOOD> That's very cool
<GOOD> If I made an alien fish the first one I'd make would be an engulfer tbh
<GOOD> Like it just swallows shit whole
<GOOD> Honestly I'm just thinking about these monkeys now
<GOOD> I need to study animal eyesight development
<GOOD> Honestly this would go kinda crazy for a monkey sniper
<GOOD> Give them funky eyes
<GOOD> And then the intelligence to use them
<GOOD> I have my last exam on Monda
<GOOD> Homestuck and a typing quirk in the same conversation
<GOOD> Just pull up the entire alphabet and then you can ctrl c and v any letter
<GOOD> True you need to be l33t
<GOOD> Desperate times call for desperate measures
<GOOD> 13375|>34|<
<GOOD> It's my typing quirk I fear
<GOOD> It's leet all the way down
<GOOD> Me trying to stop Hideo Kojima from collaborating with David Cage to make an open world narratively driven game where all interactions with the world are expressed through QTEs
<GOOD> Bro give me fucking merch
<GOOD> FNaF merch tends towards being shit but you can find some good ones
<GOOD> Mostly because of the Funko license tbh
<GOOD> The Funko merch kinda garbage
<GOOD> I literally just wanna spend money bro like let me give you money for merch Scott
<GOOD> I'm gonna go insane what are we doing
<GOOD> He didn't unless you believe in Stitchline
<GOOD> Every time someone says FNaF should have ended after UCN they don't know what's happening anyway
<GOOD> So it really shouldn't matter to them
<GOOD> The Walten Files feels like how people pretend FNaF was
<GOOD> And they continue to pretend
<GOOD> This is how Scott REALLY should have made FNaF and it's TWF and that one FNaF VHS withered Chica clip
<GOOD> If you really wanna get into this measuring contest of my thing is better than your thing then Vita Carnis drags TWF
<GOOD> This is a hollow statement
<GOOD> Scott has creative control over FNaF, saying it's not Scott is laughable
<GOOD> Arguably the lore has been far more concise since Steel Wool had the reigns, and the biggest fuck up they had was literally caused by Scott saying cryptic bullshit to them
<GOOD> Scott is the big corporation
<GOOD> Then why are you asserting things that rely on you knowing these things
<GOOD> Then why are you dragging FNaF lmao
<GOOD> Also tbh one of FNaF's creepier characters was created immediately after 6
<GOOD> I will not pretend that any FNaF 6 animatronic design except maybe Lefty is intimidating
<GOOD> They're cool (except Scraptrap) but not intimidating
<GOOD> I'm inclined to both agree and disagree with this tbh
<GOOD> Brother FNaF Sister Location came out before UCN
<GOOD> If you wanna talk about incomprehensible digital bullshit then let's drag Sister Location instead
<GOOD> Hell, if you're just gonna talk about incomprehensible stuff then bring up Remnant or Midnight Motorist
<GOOD> Or do you wanna walk it back to like, FNaF should have ended at 4
<GOOD> SL is still the source of the strangest modern sci fi tech in the series
<GOOD> Especially based on the pure lack of any mention of it afterwards except Dittophobia for the gas, the illusion disks haven't been mentioned for the better part of 8 years
<GOOD> It is right now yes
<GOOD> And honestly always
<GOOD> If I were diagnosed I'd say it's my special interest but alas
<GOOD> Why does YouTooz have to make every character smile
<GOOD> Guy who rips random teenagers limb from limb
<GOOD> It isn't even smiling it's the fuckass eyes
<GOOD> I hate it
<GOOD> I heard the Mimic I'm here I'm here
<GOOD> Does hating something count as caring about it because if so I care about Persona 5 a lot
<GOOD> 2 things can be true
<GOOD> It sucks and also it should be better
<GOOD> I mean I wish it was better not because I feel bad about it being bad, I just wish it was better because I spent money on it and it was kinda awful
<GOOD> Why did he hit the actually
<GOOD> Same it's insanely good, I think they fumbled a little with the CG on the clean Springbonnie picture but it still looks eerie
<GOOD> I just spent 10 minutes crying laughing at Injustice gameply
<GOOD> NRS games are so dogshit I love it
<GOOD> Block button
<GOOD> I can't stop him
<GOOD> Omg Diddy Kong redesign
<GOOD> I think he looks cool
<GOOD> He already had teeth
<GOOD> Diddy and Donkey Kong's teeth just get covered by their lips
<GOOD> They might be
<GOOD> You can eat shit in most survival games with shit
<GOOD> I think it poisons you
<GOOD> Account created today chat, let's have some self control
<GOOD> You guys are really bad at this
<GOOD> Like just stop talking to them it's not hard
<GOOD> They put The Mimic in the blender
<GOOD> I love the Diddy Kong redesign tbh
<GOOD> I want a fucking Mimic plush
<GOOD> Why aren't they making figures and stuff
<GOOD> Lemons aren't vegetables
<GOOD> The Mimic
<GOOD> The aura loss is fucking insane
<GOOD> Oh my god this is still happening
<GOOD> My hunt for merch for FNaF is getting frustrating
<GOOD> Dog
<GOOD> My fyp content is bountiful
<GOOD> King Boo would trap sonic in the painting
<GOOD> I do not know shit about flowers unfortunately
<GOOD> Do we fw the new Diddy Kong design
<GOOD> Yea I like the new redesigns of both of them
<GOOD> No, he's just potbellied like chimps actually tend to be
<GOOD> God you guys are unfunny
<GOOD> I don't tend to make jokes about irl offenders when a cartoon ape is brought up
<GOOD> I did not assert that I wanted to make a joke
<GOOD> Not a boy
<GOOD> Anyway as an unironic DK fan I wish I could talk about Diddy Kong without 14 year olds pretending they aren't making reddit humour
<GOOD> We don't know about Kart but the new render implies he's in Bananza
<GOOD> Tropical Freeze is really good
<GOOD> Bloodborne reference
<GOOD> I think if eating cow heart isn't NSFW then eating like anything else off an animal isn't either, it only becomes sinister if you're talking about eating human organs imo because then it becomes more like horror
<GOOD> Oh that's gore
<GOOD> That's gore of my steak
<GOOD> I'm too bony for that
<GOOD> Blood doesn't get shed from most cooked meat
<GOOD> And if it does it's like ehhh
<GOOD> I don't think steak bleeding is gore
<GOOD> What do you mean by clean
<GOOD> Cuz like I'm not gonna clean chicken for example
<GOOD> Clean is too nonspecific
<GOOD> You don't wash meat for example
<GOOD> I haven't prepared it from an animal's body if that's what you're asking
<GOOD> Exactly
<GOOD> Like I don't understand what cleaning means, you can't clean meat in the typical way
<GOOD> You do realise I was asserting that blood on steak isn't gore right, but many meats just don't have real blood after cooking
<GOOD> They just have juice
<GOOD> I love ragebait
<GOOD> Nightmare blunt rotation
<GOOD> My wife just brought me a sandwich (not asked for) with chips as I get a double kill bot lane
<GOOD> Fish
<GOOD> I went to an autism room by random chance
<GOOD> People just falling for blatant lies then getting mad about it once again
<GOOD> The wheel continues to turn
<GOOD> I miss the autism room I was in
<GOOD> I don't think your trust of any gaming company should be really over Nintendo tbh they're all ass except like Valve
<GOOD> The Xbox has had the ability to brick from modding since its first console apparently
<GOOD> Hello walk
<GOOD> Non binary
<GOOD> I am very romantic
<GOOD> My wife
<GOOD> YOU'RE ALMOST 30??
<GOOD> I knew you were late 20s but not nearly 30
<GOOD> Toei is like one of the biggest animation companies
<GOOD> I'm mad about this image rn because the implication is that the guy doesn't look any different but he does
<GOOD> Marcel I went to an autism sensory room
<GOOD> It was so fun
<GOOD> I feel very very calm
<GOOD> I like water
<GOOD> True...
<GOOD> Oh yeah and I turned myself into an art reference in the autism room, I look cool as hell
<GOOD> Red Guy DHMIS
<GOOD> It's actually called a sensory room, it's just a relaxing room for people that are neurodivergent and may need to be soothed
<GOOD> It has lots of satisfying activities in it
<GOOD> Idk these strands were really fun to tangle and untangle
<GOOD> There was also a colour board that made zeep zorp noises, texture walls, a big tube that bubbled, mood lights, etcetc
<GOOD> Ok not to get political but I think Ben of Ben and Jerry's just got arrested for being a protestor
<GOOD> Might buy ice cream
<GOOD> I wanna go back to the sensory room
<GOOD> I miss the sensory room I want it back
<GOOD> I went today by pure chance
<GOOD> Another excuse to flex this picture of me almost asleep and hooked up to The Apparatus
<GOOD> I'm using this shit as an art reference soon
<GOOD> The strands are like hair you're meant to sort, separate or braid thwm
<GOOD> There was a bunch of other stuff I did in there I was rlly relaxed
<GOOD> I spent a good 20 minutes just staring at a giant tube of bubbles
<GOOD> I really wanna go back tbh
<GOOD> I might be neurodivergent chat it was so soothing
<GOOD> I'm more calm than I've been in months
<GOOD> I've self diagnosed after about 3 years of research into autism symptoms
<GOOD> ~~Anxiety and depression I didn't really have to research I know I have that shit~~
<GOOD> Idk if intrusive thoughts are symptoms of any of those but I get those also
<GOOD> That's probably about it tho, I don't wanna collect self diagnoses
<GOOD> But I really do feel like this stuff is up w me
<GOOD> I've never been formally tested for anything, I've barely even had physical evaluations
<GOOD> I also live in the UK and if I'm being honest, I don't want to be diagnosed after the 10 year waiting list
<GOOD> I don't want to be formally recognised as neurodivergent
<GOOD> I would go so far as to say I'm afraid to be formally recognised
<GOOD> So I'm just taking the easy way and living with it
<GOOD> Yeahh I really don't want that to happen
<GOOD> I don't even have work experience
<GOOD> I need to pretend I'm normal which is rlly hard
<GOOD> I masked for years, but for the last 2 years I've been so much happier, but by doing that I've found that I've lost my ability to mask as well
<GOOD> Which is very very scary
<GOOD> That's not worth it
<GOOD> I do not trust the government to treat me normally if I'm formally recognised as disabled
<GOOD> Same with other people
<GOOD> I don't tell anyone I'm autistic I just make acquaintances and then after a few months in casual conversation they're just like YOU'RE NOT DIAGNOSED??
<GOOD> Which I find entertaining
<GOOD> Ok so alongside all the other social issues, my ass has been physically unable to stop talking about FNaF literally forever and it's so ass
<GOOD> I want to talk about FNaF forever
<GOOD> Like I actively wanna talk about FNaF forever, every day for years
<GOOD> And I've been like that for a decade
<GOOD> I think that would count as a special interest
<GOOD> And then the difference between that and a hyperfixation is when I was hyperfixated on Rain World and played like 98 hours of it in a week
<GOOD> And forgot to eat
<GOOD> It may have been 2 weeks idk
<GOOD> But either way it's not normal based on the looks I get from friends
<GOOD> Well acquaintance-friends
<GOOD> Thanks
<GOOD> It fuckin bothered me lmao I had deadlines I almost missed because of it
<GOOD> And then I cried because I wasn't good enough at the game to do it right, which in hindsight isn't really a thing
<GOOD> I got upset because I couldn't enjoy it but also couldn't take a break
<GOOD> What becomes justifiable
<GOOD> I was aware it was a problem before it was pointed out
<GOOD> I don't really care how it was said but the whole point of a hyperfixation is that it's suffocating
<GOOD> Autism is a mental ailment(?) for a reason
<GOOD> I don't remember the term rn I'm tired
<GOOD> Rain World is my favourite game of all time still
<GOOD> When my hyperfixations end I cry
<GOOD> It feels horrible
<GOOD> Yeah.
<GOOD> I'm glad I always have FNaF
<GOOD> I can just fall back on it forever if I need comfort
<GOOD> Ups and downs
<GOOD> I want to talk about FNaF always, forever, in any conversation
<GOOD> It's kinda tiring to not talk about it sometimes
<GOOD> I like a lot of things but I don't have a hyperfixation rn
<GOOD> This is me w any hyperfixation tbh, especially Rain World but for that one I honestly just had a blast being taught it
<GOOD> Remembering when I played like 100 hours of MHGU in 2 and a half weeks
<GOOD> That was a fun one
<GOOD> It's ok
<GOOD> I feel like I know like, almost everything of FNaF, and I'm not trying to brag about that
<GOOD> I obviously don't know what's happening in it because it's a lot of theories, but I do have my own timeline in my head I need to construct one day
<GOOD> 3
<GOOD> Gottem
<GOOD> I literally just talked about why I'm talking about FNaF rn
<GOOD> Please leave me alone
<GOOD> I can understand that, some of it is kinda eerie
<GOOD> Glitchtrap is the animatronic that scares me most
<GOOD> Also  I was literally just mentioning FNaF because of this
<GOOD> That was the necessary context
<GOOD> Yeah I just fucking said that
<GOOD> So leave me alone please
<GOOD> You can ask me about anything else and I will answer it but this conversation was literally about being neurodivergent
<GOOD> And this was my experience with being probably neurodivergent
<GOOD> Well *is
<GOOD> I carried boxes for someone again today and now my hand won't make a fist
<GOOD> My hand hitting the Mimic curl
<GOOD> I didn't like when you said those things, I did like when we talked about FNaF but I didn't interpret what you said as friendly
<GOOD> Since you say it every time I talk about FNaF here
<GOOD> Oh right aglet did you see the new renders
<GOOD> If u like Mario
<GOOD> I agree
<GOOD> Did you see new Diddy kong too?
<GOOD> Yeaa I'm happy we got a refresher for merch etc
<GOOD> Tbf that was never not the case but I understand
<GOOD> I have been a DK fan since childhood and I'm so excited for this new design
<GOOD> Yes definitely
<GOOD> Mhm
<GOOD> To be honest I think MKW is where a bit of the new design slander came from
<GOOD> I think he looks significantly better in Bananza
<GOOD> Although I do like his design even in MKW
<GOOD> In World he looks a bit... Weird?
<GOOD> It's like a fused design
<GOOD> I'm a bit of a MK8D sweat
<GOOD> Not amazing or anything just good lines and ok macro
<GOOD> I'm excited for competitive MKWorld tho
<GOOD> I wanna draw my new OC more
<GOOD> I've only drawn them like twice and they look fucked up
<GOOD> I kinda love them
<GOOD> Perhaps
<GOOD> They are a Yakuza
<GOOD> I was literally talking about them being in the yakuza a few days ago to a friend, and I was saying their jacket should have a design on it (seen in the image)
<GOOD> And I was saying they should have like, a dragon on it and I had to literally hold my own mouth shut to not say that
<GOOD> They aren't from Yakuza
<GOOD> They just are in the yakuza
<GOOD> They're actually a Kagurabachi OC
<GOOD> NEW FNAF TRAILER WHAT
<GOOD> SOTM APPARENTLY
<GOOD> I'm watching Fusion watch it rn
<GOOD> It's a very small teaser tho
<GOOD> 5'8 ish and 19
<GOOD> Tall/lh
<GOOD> Yes yes
<GOOD> I'm pretty short
<GOOD> Ig
<GOOD> I'm so perfect
<GOOD> Jk I actually wanna be shorter
<GOOD> Make me like 5'2
<GOOD> As someone that's modded I advise against it but if you still want to then go for it
<GOOD> Dealing with you people has taken years off my life
<GOOD> Nooooo
<GOOD> Also good morning chat
<GOOD> I was out of the house by 6am and awake at 5
<GOOD> Now I'm playing Melee at 7am
<GOOD> This is my life
<GOOD> Yes you must
<GOOD> Bro I feel so
<GOOD> I'm trying to unlock all the Melee characters for my gaming club rn
<GOOD> Ganondorf in Melee is very fun btw
<GOOD> Fetish talk in genchat again yayyy
<GOOD> It's pretty ass
<GOOD> You should experience the first 10 hours of the game
<GOOD> And I played 10 hours and dropped it for being boring
<GOOD> And weird
<GOOD> And hamfisted
<GOOD> Why on earth would I do that
<GOOD> A game that takes double digit hours to click or get into is too long
<GOOD> If I play 10 hours of Persona 5 and it isn't good why would I play more Persona 5
<GOOD> You don't owe video games your time
<GOOD> Movies can hook me in 1 minute, if 10 hours isn't enough then lmao
<GOOD> This is my personal cutoff point, if it gets weirder it gets slashed now but when I played P5 I had more of a tolerance for weird unnecessary shit I didn't like
<GOOD> Yes I do
<GOOD> Idk man it was boring as shit and Persona 5 fans in particular tend to be very obnoxious and grandstanding about it
<GOOD> I've played a few JRPGs and Persona 5 is the only one I dropped for being boring as fuck
<GOOD> I didn't like the story beats, the characters, and Kamoshida might be the least interesting first villain I've seen in any game
<GOOD> Sorry to hear that
<GOOD> To both of those things
<GOOD> Feels like a pretty banal reason to like a JRPG
<GOOD> Anyway play Chrono Trigger or smth chat it's like 20 hours long
<GOOD> Also play FF7 because that one also exists
<GOOD> Oh and also Joker sucks in Smash
<GOOD> Get my man Jack Frost in there
<GOOD> Happy 5am chat
<GOOD> I forget some of these are horror
<GOOD> Funger pissed me off so bad
<GOOD> Shit felt like a rage game
<GOOD> It's difficult /neg
<GOOD> Like I like hard games but Funger is one of those uoghh I'm so difficult you should suffer for doing anything in the game experiences
<GOOD> Real Sprunki Horror Mod fans know...
<GOOD> Can I be honest even before the backrooms had monsters I was indifferent to it
<GOOD> Anyone else a creepypasta lore purist
<GOOD> Like there are no Operators, there are no 7 Guardians of X, there is only Slenderman and Sonic.exe
<GOOD> The rest is utter woke nonsense
<GOOD> Love should only be between a Slenderman and a Jeff the Killer
<GOOD> My friend tells me about these guys, this Homicidal Liu and Ticci Toby
<GOOD> Also if you want horror that isn't scary play Finding Franky it was made to be a fun parkour game
<GOOD> Depends on context
<GOOD> Funger didn't scare me by being stupid difficult and having a sepsis mechanic
<GOOD> *Tetanus
<GOOD> I think it's just not good tbh
<GOOD> I haven't tried Termina but Funger 1 is just like, straight up not good
<GOOD> I had to reset so many times in Funger because almost every interaction is just RNG
<GOOD> And if your lead member gets injured ever you basically just lose, and if your lead member isn't Cahara everything gets like 10x harder
<GOOD> It's just not well designed
<GOOD> Very cool
<GOOD> Imagine Resident Evil but if you get hit by a zombie then you IMMEDIATELY get reduced and blurry POV, you start walking at half the speed, and you can't shove the zombies off of you anymore if you get attacked
<GOOD> And that lasts forever
<GOOD> Funger doesn't even allow you to restore lost extremities in most situations
<GOOD> The Crow Mauler also just fucking sucked to fight but that's fine because you usually aren't meant to
<GOOD> Actually most bosses were pretty ass
<GOOD> I think that hard games have their place in tonal setting but if it's all the game relies on then it's really not all that
<GOOD> Oh and finally Funger is just like, very bad at handling some of the gratuitous horror it does
<GOOD> It feels like reading the first arc of Berserk like 4 times over
<GOOD> Security Breach Switch speedrun
<GOOD> Speedrunning 3ds Minecraft
<GOOD> I'm almost certain that 3ds Minecraft is just like 4 chunks of superflat
<GOOD> My ragebait is always pretty goated, I was molded in it
<GOOD> remove 955689531934404608
<GOOD> add 1094471235603275869
